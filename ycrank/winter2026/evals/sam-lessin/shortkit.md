# shortkit -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the core problem with ShortKit: the founder is arguably overqualified for an idea that's underpowered. Michael Seleman spent six years building YouTube Shorts infrastructure at the largest scale imaginable — that's an extraordinary credential, the kind of deep systems knowledge you can't fake. He knows adaptive bitrate transcoding, feed ranking, and global delivery at a level that maybe a few hundred people on earth understand. That's about as "sane" as a founder gets for this specific domain. But the idea — build an SDK so other apps can embed TikTok-style feeds — isn't insane. It's the most obvious product someone with his background would build. Every product manager at every consumer app company has already had the "should we add a short-form video feed?" conversation. The market is asking for this. That means the returns are already being priced in. My framework produces the strongest signal when a credible person proposes something that makes most investors uncomfortable. ShortKit makes investors comfortable. "Sane person, sane idea" is the configuration that produces competent lifestyle businesses, not the asymmetric outcomes I need from a seed check.

Run the AI kill test and the picture gets worse. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The individual technical components (HLS transcoding, CDN delivery, video player SDKs) are commoditized." ShortKit's differentiation claim is vertical integration — bundling those commoditized components into a purpose-built SDK with feed logic and analytics. But feed logic is algorithms. Analytics is data processing. These are precisely the things AI makes cheaper to build, not harder. An engineering team that would have needed six months and three specialists to build a short-form feed in 2024 might need one engineer and a coding assistant for three weeks in 2027. The trend line runs directly against the product's value proposition. This isn't a painting company where AI optimizes dispatch but can't replace the crew on the ladder — this IS the software. The software is the entire business. That's the exact category I've been publicly arguing is being destroyed.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If ShortKit became the default "Stripe for short-form video" — the SDK every app integrates rather than builds — the switching costs from analytics history, SDK integration depth, and data migration could create genuine lock-in. Seleman's architectural knowledge from YouTube Shorts is a real head start that competitors would need years to replicate. And the timing argument has some logic: short-form video is becoming table stakes for consumer apps beyond social media (fitness, news, e-commerce, education), creating a wave of teams that need this capability but lack the expertise to build it. If that demand wave is real and hits before AI makes self-building trivial, ShortKit could capture a meaningful wedge. The Mux comparison is instructive — Mux built a real business ($46M revenue) on horizontal video infrastructure that any team could theoretically build themselves. A verticalized version for the hottest content format could work. But I'd need to see evidence that the demand exists at scale — named customers, LOIs, anything — and I see none.

The protocol-layer test clinches my pass. ShortKit is an application sitting on top of existing infrastructure — CDNs, HLS standards, Apple's AVFoundation framework. It doesn't create a new primitive that other businesses build on; it bundles existing primitives into a convenience layer. That's fine as a product, but it caps the upside narrative. Compare this to my Venmo investment: peer-to-peer mobile payments were a new financial primitive that an entire ecosystem of applications eventually built around. Or Helium, which created a new wireless infrastructure protocol. ShortKit doesn't establish a new layer in the stack — it's a well-integrated set of features on someone else's layers. When Mux decides to ship a short-form feed module (and at $46M in revenue with 4,900 customers, they have the resources and distribution to do it), ShortKit's position becomes extremely precarious. The iOS-only limitation at launch compounds this — you're betting on capturing a beachhead while only addressing half the mobile market, giving competitors time to build the cross-platform version first.

One additional note on the founding team: the dossier found "no shared employer or university overlap" between the two founders. Seleman went to Tufts and worked at YouTube; Bhammar went to Northeastern and worked at BusRight. That's not disqualifying — plenty of great teams form through networks rather than shared history — but it triggers my pattern-matching on co-founder relationships. The founding teams I've backed that survived real adversity (and building infrastructure companies involves years of adversity before product-market fit) had deep pre-existing bonds. Combined with the key-person risk on Seleman as the sole technical founder with relevant domain expertise, this is a fragile team structure for the challenge they're taking on.
