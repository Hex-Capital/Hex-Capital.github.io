# Return Signals -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I'd want to understand is the journey between MDandMe and Return Signals. Ilya Valmianski built SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente — a conversational AI system trained on 25 million primary care encounters, serving millions of patients. That's genuinely impressive engineering work. He then founded MDandMe, raised $2 million in June 2023 for an AI symptom checker, and by 2025 he's registered a new entity called Material Model doing business as Return Signals, an AI concierge for e-commerce returns. What happened in that gap? I don't have the answer, and that ambiguity matters. When I evaluate founders, the first thing I ask is: tell me your story, not the business. And the story here reads as a technically gifted person who built something remarkable in healthcare, tried to start a company in healthcare, and then applied the same conversational AI pattern to a completely different sector because the market opportunity was cleaner. That's rational. It's smart. But it's not the biographical thread I look for — the thread where the founder and the problem are inseparable, where the person's life experience makes them the only one who could see this particular solution.

Neither founder has documented roots in e-commerce or retail. Alejandro Zaniolo comes from business development at Nestpick and Blueground — proptech companies. Columbia-educated, VP-level roles at funded startups. A competent commercial operator, certainly. But when I combine these two backgrounds — healthcare ML and proptech BD — and I see them landing on "AI concierge that reduces e-commerce returns," I see a team that found a viable market application for transferable skills, not a team that was called to solve this problem from something they lived. I've learned that the founders who persist through the really brutal stretches are the ones who can't walk away because the problem is personal. I don't see what makes this problem personal for either of them.

The product itself is sensible and well-constructed — proactive outbound SMS before a customer initiates a return, photo-based troubleshooting, steering toward exchanges over refunds. The claimed 70% exchange conversion rate would be genuinely valuable to merchants if it holds at scale. But "AI improves a business process" is perhaps the most consensus investment thesis of this moment. Every VC in San Francisco understands this pitch instantly. It's not difficult to assess. It's not unpopular. Nobody at a partner meeting is going to feel uncomfortable when this deck comes up. And that's exactly the kind of signal that tells me to step back. The companies I've done well with — SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline — all made people squirm. They were hard to explain at a dinner party. "We're using AI to help apparel brands convert returns into exchanges" does not make anyone squirm.

The strongest bull case is this: if you believe the core moat is in the conversational AI tuning — the accumulation of post-purchase interaction data, product-issue taxonomies, and exchange recommendation models that improve over time — then Ilya's SmartTriage background is arguably the best possible training ground for building that system. Patient triage and return triage share deep structural similarity: someone presents with a complaint, you ask diagnostic questions (including image-based assessment), and you route to the optimal resolution. The LLM timing is real — this kind of nuanced, empathetic conversation wasn't possible at reasonable cost two years ago. And the proactive positioning is a genuine strategic wedge against Loop, Narvar, and AfterShip, whose reactive portal models would have to be rearchitected to compete directly. If the early pilots produce case studies showing 5-10% margin uplift, the Shopify ecosystem could drive rapid word-of-mouth distribution. I can see how this becomes a solid business. But a solid business built on skills transfer into a consensus market with well-funded incumbents who can add SMS outreach as a feature — that's not the kind of asymmetric bet I write checks for.

What I also notice: this company doesn't create economic access for people who currently lack it. It helps DTC apparel brands — businesses that already have customers and infrastructure — preserve their margins. That's legitimate value, but it's optimization for the already-resourced. When I backed Uber, I was thinking about Roger, my driver, and the millions of people who could earn income through their car. When I backed Affirm, it was about transparent credit for people getting buried by hidden credit card fees. Return Signals' self-description as a "luxury concierge" actually runs in the opposite direction of what pulls me in. And the co-founder relationship is a blank space — no shared history I can find, no documented connection, no evidence of how they handle disagreement. After HQ Trivia, I don't invest into that blank space without answers.
