# Polymorph -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumped out at me immediately: three engineers from Meta, Scale AI, and Palantir building an AI-powered notification platform in a market where Braze does $593 million in revenue, Customer.io just crossed $100 million ARR, and Iterable is valued at $2 billion. Every single one of those incumbents is already bolting on AI features. This isn't a space where nobody's looking — this is a space where *everybody* is looking, and they have massive head starts. When I think about the companies that have defined my portfolio, they share one quality above all else: nobody else wanted to fund them. SpaceX was considered delusional. Crusoe Energy sounded like a prank. Contraline made VCs squirm. Polymorph sounds like something any VC would nod along to — good team, big market, AI differentiation. That consensus legibility is precisely the signal that makes me step back.

I can't find the founder story here, and that's where I always start. The dossier tells me David Nie was a Staff Engineer at Meta Ads, Manas Purohit spent eight years across Facebook, Gusto, Palantir, and Intuit, and Andrew Sy built ML inference infrastructure at Scale AI handling ten million calls a day. These are genuinely strong technical credentials. But I don't know why *these three people* are compelled to solve *this particular problem*. Did one of them watch a company they loved churn users because its notifications were tone-deaf? Did someone experience the pain of being a growth engineer drowning in Braze configuration at 2am? There's no biographical thread connecting the founders to the mission in a way that tells me they'll keep building through the inevitable moment when a competitor with a hundred million dollars undercuts them or an incumbent ships a "good enough" AI feature. The snippets about "HBS, Princeton" suggest elite educational backgrounds, which is fine, but it's the opposite of the outsider signal I'm drawn to.

The bull case deserves honest engagement, because there is one. These founders didn't just work adjacent to personalization — they helped build Facebook's ad targeting engine, which is arguably the most sophisticated real-time user profiling system ever constructed. If they can distill that institutional knowledge into a product that self-serve SaaS companies can adopt without hiring a lifecycle marketing team, there's a real wedge. The timing argument has merit too: standardized data layers like Segment and PostHog create plug-and-play integration points that didn't exist five years ago, and inference costs have dropped enough to make per-user model evaluation economically viable. The structural tension where incumbents profit from manual complexity while Polymorph automates it away is a genuine business model moat — it's the same dynamic that made Affirm dangerous to credit card companies. If everything breaks right, Polymorph could be the company that makes enterprise-grade personalization accessible to teams that currently can't afford Braze. That's a legitimate opportunity.

But I keep coming back to what I don't feel here. This company doesn't create economic access for anyone who currently lacks it. It doesn't make an invisible system visible — marketing notifications are already a well-understood, well-instrumented category. It doesn't operate in a stigmatized or regulated space that would deter other entrants. The HIPAA and SOC-2 compliance is table stakes for selling to health-tech customers, not a regulatory moat. And the commoditization risk is real: the underlying technologies — event aggregation, ML-based send-time optimization, multi-channel delivery — are well-understood building blocks. Six companies already share the Polymorph name, which tells me something about how differentiated even the identity feels. I look for companies where the founder's conviction creates a force field that competitors can't replicate. Here I see capable engineers who could build many things, building a reasonable thing, in a space where many others are building similar things. That's a bet I leave to investors who optimize for pedigree and market size. It's not where I write checks from my own money.

The co-founder dynamic is the one area where I'll note a modest positive: three people who overlapped at Meta have a shared working vocabulary and cultural reference point. That's not nothing — I've seen companies die from co-founder misalignment, and prior professional relationships reduce that risk. But I'd need to sit with them and understand how they navigate disagreement before giving real credit here.
