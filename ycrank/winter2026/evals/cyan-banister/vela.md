# Vela -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Gobhanu and Saatvik Korisepati isn't Vela -- it's SWIFTmfi. Two brothers, fourteen years old, in Oman, building a microfinance organization that disbursed over $400,000 in interest-free microloans to 3,200 women across 77 countries. That is genuinely remarkable. That story -- two kids deciding the world's financial system wasn't reaching the people who needed it most and building their own alternative -- that's the kind of biographical thread I listen for. When someone at fourteen is already driven by the injustice of financial exclusion, I want to understand what's fueling that fire. And the Diana Legacy Award, one of twenty young people globally -- that tells me the world noticed what they built. So here's my honest reaction: these brothers have already demonstrated the kind of initiative that I associate with founders who go the distance. But the company they're building now doesn't connect to that story. SWIFTmfi was about economic access for women who had none. Vela is a scheduling tool for enterprise recruiters and sales teams. When I ask my question -- "tell me your story, how did you get here?" -- the thread from microfinance in Oman to calendar coordination for corporate hiring teams feels like a detour, not a destination.

The brother dynamic is the strongest signal in this dossier, and it's the one a generic analyst would overlook. After HQ Trivia destroyed what should have been a transformative company because two co-founders couldn't resolve their differences, I started paying very close attention to how founding teams handle conflict. Brothers who have been building together since they were fourteen, who survived the chaos of running an organization across 77 countries as teenagers, who then pursued separate elite educations and came back together to build again -- that's exactly the kind of battle-tested relationship I look for. Family businesses have a conflict resolution mechanism that most co-founder pairs don't: they've been arguing and making up their entire lives. Saatvik dropping out of a UChicago Booth dual degree to build Vela alongside his brother tells me the commitment is real. This dimension is genuinely strong.

But scheduling is not the kind of bet that gives me that jolt of intuitive energy. AI scheduling assistants are possibly the single most consensus application of large language models right now. Every VC I know understands this category. Calendly is a $3 billion company. Clockwise raised $76 million. Motion raised $102 million. Dropbox acquired Reclaim.ai. This is not a space where people look at you funny when you describe the idea -- it's a space where people nod along because they've seen twenty versions of it. The most promising companies I've backed share a specific characteristic: they are not popular. Vela is building in one of the most popular categories in enterprise AI. The conversational multi-channel approach is a legitimate product differentiation from link-based scheduling, but it's an obvious one. Any team with access to frontier models and calendar APIs can build a conversational scheduling agent. The differentiation is real but not durable in the way I need it to be.

The bull case I want to genuinely engage with: Saatvik's technical pedigree is exceptional for this kind of build. AWS ML Supercompute, Perplexity, CMU CS completed in two years with highest honors, a patent at sixteen. If anyone can build a scheduling agent that actually handles the messiness of multi-party, multi-channel coordination with the accuracy that enterprise customers demand, it's someone with that infrastructure background. And the LLM timing is genuinely right -- conversational scheduling negotiation wasn't possible two years ago. If Vela can nail the recruiting vertical hard enough to become the default scheduling layer for enterprise hiring, the expansion path is real. The acquisitions of Reclaim.ai and Kronologic in 2024 also suggest consolidation that might leave a gap for a purpose-built new entrant. If I squint, I can see a world where their multi-channel integration complexity compounds into a meaningful moat as they accumulate scheduling preference data across thousands of organizations. But even in that scenario, I'd expect Calendly or one of the major calendar platforms to ship a competitive feature before Vela can build defensible scale.

What's missing for me is the thing that makes me willing to be the first check: these founders built something extraordinary for underserved women around the world, and now they're building a productivity tool for people who already have plenty of resources. I invest in companies that create economic access -- Uber for drivers, Postmates for delivery workers, Affirm for people locked out of transparent credit. Vela makes scheduling more efficient for enterprise recruiters and sales teams. That's useful, but it doesn't make an invisible system visible or create opportunity for people who lack it. If these brothers had taken their SWIFTmfi insight and built something that extended financial or economic access using the AI infrastructure Saatvik knows how to build, I'd be leaning very differently. The founders have the grit and the relationship -- they're solving the wrong problem for my thesis.
