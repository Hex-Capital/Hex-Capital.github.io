# Maywood -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Maywood is that it lands squarely in the pattern I've been cautioning founders about: "AI for X," where X is a large, obvious market. AI for M&A. AI for investment banking. The phrasing alone should make you wary. When I said the most impressive companies I've seen recently are not working on AI, this is the kind of company I was contrasting them with -- not because AI applied to banking can't work, but because the idea has a manufactured quality to it. A team with finance backgrounds noticed that LLMs can generate documents, and investment banks produce a lot of documents. The logic is sound. But sound logic is not the same as organic discovery. Sound logic is what produces the ideas I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas" -- clever applications that emerge from scanning for opportunities rather than from an itch you can't stop scratching.

That said, Drake Goodman was actually inside the machine. He was an investor at Blackstone in private equity. He sat through deal execution. He watched people copy figures between documents and format CIMs by hand. That's not nothing -- it's real domain exposure, not secondhand market research. But the specific framing that he "helped roll out AI initiatives" at Blackstone tells me something. His angle into the problem was through the lens of AI application, not through the lens of frustration that finally boiled over. The difference between "I spent five years drowning in this broken process and finally built what I needed" and "I noticed this process could be improved with AI" is the difference between Dropbox and a brainstorming session. Drew Houston didn't think "cloud storage is a big market." He kept forgetting his USB drive. I don't see the USB-drive moment here.

Where Maywood does earn credit in my framework is on schlep willingness. Selling enterprise software to investment banks is a genuinely ugly schlep that most AI startups instinctively avoid. Banks require SOC 2 Type II certification, single-tenant deployments, self-hosted options, GDPR compliance, and procurement cycles that can drag on for a year. Maywood has already achieved SOC 2 Type II at pre-seed. That's real work -- unglamorous, expensive, time-consuming compliance work that gets you zero press coverage and zero Twitter followers. Most founders building "AI for finance" demo their product on Twitter and avoid the regulatory thicket. These founders walked into it. That's the kind of schlep that creates structural barriers to competition from the dozens of AI wrapper companies that will never bother getting certified.

The strongest bull case is this: the competitive dynamics actually favor a purpose-built entrant right now. Datasite is the incumbent, but incumbents buying AI companies (Grata for $200M, Blueflame AI) is often a sign of weakness, not strength. It means they couldn't build it internally. Acquisition integration is where large companies go to destroy startups they overpaid for. And OffDeal is building an AI-native investment bank that competes with banks rather than selling to them -- a fundamentally different bet. If Maywood can get embedded in five or six middle-market banks during this window while incumbents are digesting acquisitions and competitors are chasing a different model, the switching costs from firm-specific data integration could make them sticky. The anonymous testimonials -- "doubling our capacity" and "on pace to double our deal count" -- describe exactly the kind of economic dependency I look for. If a bank is genuinely doubling its deal throughput with Maywood, ripping it out would be painful. But I can't verify any of that. "Several banks" with no names and no revenue figures could mean anything from signed six-figure contracts to free pilots with associates who are testing the product on weekends.

The team is credentialed but not scrappy. Wharton Huntsman Summa Cum Laude, MIT EECS, Blackstone, BCG, Balyasny -- these are people who have succeeded within highly structured systems. That's achievement, but it's not the same as resourcefulness. I look for founders who've been tested outside the system, who've had to invent around obstacles when the conventional path failed. The cereal box test isn't about cereal -- it's about whether founders can create something from nothing when everything goes wrong. I don't see that signal here. What I do see is that Drake and Kent Goodman are almost certainly siblings, which is actually one of the strongest possible co-founder configurations. Siblings who choose to work together have a relationship built on decades, not a co-founder speed-dating event. That's a quiet but real positive. And Esteban Vizcaino's ICML 2024 publication demonstrates genuine ML research depth -- he's not just calling APIs. But the CEO has no technical background, and I see no public code from any founder. For a company whose entire value proposition is AI-powered, the hacker signal is thinner than I'd like.

The core risk is commoditization dressed up as category creation. Generating CIMs and pitch decks with LLMs is not a technical moat. Any well-funded team with domain knowledge and good engineers can build this -- and Datasite has $157.9M in revenue and a $500M commitment from CapVest to do exactly that. Maywood's defensibility depends entirely on execution speed and integration depth, not on proprietary technology. That's a viable strategy, but it's a race, and pre-seed companies rarely win races against incumbents with hundred-million-dollar war chests unless they have a structural advantage. The structural advantage here would have to be that purpose-built AI-native architecture is fundamentally better than bolted-on AI features in legacy platforms. That might be true. But it requires the banks to recognize it and switch, which requires surviving long enough to prove it, which requires the kind of scrappy capital efficiency I see no evidence of -- hiring two engineers at $150K-$250K at pre-seed does not signal lean operations.
