# Panta -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is that five YC-backed companies are pursuing AI-powered commercial insurance brokerage simultaneously. Harper, one batch ahead, has already reported $2.3M in revenue and a 25-person team. 1Fort raised $10M for broker-enablement tools. Coverflow, Fernstone, RiskCube -- all circling the same thesis: AI will automate the insurance broker. When five funded teams are converging on a category in overlapping YC batches, you're not making a contrarian bet. You're making a consensus bet with worse pricing. The real money in angel investing comes from being non-consensus and right. "AI disrupts insurance brokerage" is currently on every fintech investor's whiteboard. That's not a secret -- that's a slide deck everyone has seen.

The specific knowledge problem is the deeper issue. Vincent Chen built foundation models at Google's Vertex AI. Frank Wang is a senior full-stack engineer from Apple who contributes to Rust and Gleam ecosystems. Strong technical builders -- exactly the kind of founding team I want to see in any technology company. But what do they know about commercial insurance that can't be taught? Where is the decade of obsession with how risk flows through the surplus lines market? The proprietary understanding of why carriers price the way they do, or why certain underwriting workflows resist automation while others don't? Their explosive materials demo is impressive execution, but processing 70 pages of chemistry documentation is an engineering challenge, not a manifestation of irreplaceable domain insight. A sufficiently capable ML team -- and there are many of those now -- could build the same capability in months. When the knowledge is acquirable through engineering effort alone, it's not the kind of specific knowledge that creates durable founder-problem fit.

The leverage architecture is genuinely interesting, and I'll give credit where it's due. "Service business with software economics" is the right aspiration. A brokerage that earns commission revenue without proportional broker headcount is a beautiful business if it works -- every policy placed by an AI agent is nearly pure margin. That's real leverage: code replacing human intermediaries at scale. The 99% placement rate and 100+ carrier relationships suggest the system actually functions. But the leverage here isn't proprietary to Panta. Harper has the same leverage architecture. 1Fort, if it evolves from broker-enablement to full brokerage, has the same leverage architecture. The leverage is a property of the category thesis, not of the company. I backed Notion because it created a form of individual productivity leverage that no one else had conceived of in quite the same way. Here, the leverage mechanism is the category -- and the category is crowded.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. The innovator's dilemma argument is real: Marsh, Aon, and Willis control 52% of brokerage revenue and cannot automate away their own workforce without organizational collapse. That structural opening is genuine and large. Panta's focus on heavy industry -- construction, oil & gas, manufacturing -- targets the highest-value, most complex policies where broker bottlenecks are most acute and switching costs are highest. If they can reliably automate specialty and surplus lines underwriting for hazardous industries, that's a wedge most competitors aren't pursuing. The 50-state licensing and 127 reviews at 4.9 stars suggest they're not vaporware -- they're placing real policies. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that domain expertise in heavy industry risk assessment compounds faster than general AI insurance capabilities, and that Panta's vertical focus creates a data moat that horizontal competitors can't replicate. That's a plausible theory. But it requires Panta to win a knowledge accumulation race against a competitor with a one-batch head start and 10x the revenue, in a category where the underlying AI technology is commoditizing quarterly.

I keep coming back to the team composition. Two exceptional engineers from Google and Apple, applying general-purpose AI capabilities to a market they identified as large and inefficient. That's a pattern I've seen hundreds of times. Sometimes it works -- but it works because of execution speed and market timing, not because of irreplaceable founder insight. The most durable companies I've backed had founders who understood their domain so deeply that their contrarian position emerged naturally from years of accumulated understanding, not from market analysis. Insurance brokerage has genuine complexity, and the founders may develop deep domain knowledge over time. But "will develop" is a different bet than "already possesses." At this stage, I'm being asked to bet on execution speed in a competitive race, not on compounding specific knowledge. Those are fundamentally different risk profiles, and the former is not the kind of bet I optimize for.

Pass. Smart builders, real market, working product -- but no specific knowledge edge, a consensus category with a direct competitor ahead, and nothing that compounds in a way unique to this team. The technology is increasingly table-stakes, and the race will be won by whoever accumulates carrier relationships and underwriting data fastest. That might be Panta, but it's an execution bet, not a leverage bet.
