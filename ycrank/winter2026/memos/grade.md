## The Idea

**Problem:** Companies running creator and influencer programs need to pay large numbers of creators across jurisdictions, using compensation models tied to performance (views, clicks, conversions) rather than fixed hourly rates. Today, managing this requires juggling spreadsheets, hundreds of individual invoices, manual payment approvals, and tax compliance across countries. The YC page describes the problem as traditional payroll systems still compensating based on hours rather than output, creating manual approval processes and payment delays (YC company page).

**Approach:** Grade provides a single platform where companies add a creator by email (no onboarding calls or account setup), configure payment rules (flat fees, performance-based pay, or hybrid), and then bulk-approve and pay in minutes. The platform automates tracking of creator performance, calculates earnings, consolidates billing into a single invoice for finance teams, and handles tax compliance—creators submit tax forms once and Grade maintains records, supporting W-9, W-8BEN, and equivalent documentation by jurisdiction (usegrade.com). Payouts cover 190+ countries (usegrade.com).

**Differentiation:** Compared to general-purpose accounts payable platforms like Tipalti (which serves 5,000+ companies across many industries), Grade is purpose-built for the creator payment use case with native performance-based compensation logic. Tipalti requires integration with external campaign tracking to calculate performance-based payouts; Grade bundles tracking and payment calculation natively. Compared to Lumanu, which focuses on agencies and talent managers with financing and invoicing tools, Grade targets the brand/company side with a simpler "email-to-pay" workflow requiring no creator onboarding. Compared to Stir, which focuses on revenue-sharing between collaborating creators, Grade targets companies paying creators rather than creator-to-creator splits.

**Business Model:** No public pricing page was found on usegrade.com at time of research. [Inferred]: Most likely monetization path is a per-transaction fee or percentage of payout volume, consistent with fintech payments platforms in this space (industry standard is 5–15% platform fee per Meltwater, 2026 via search snippet). The $380K+ monthly payout volume suggests early revenue generation if a take-rate model is in place, though no revenue figures are disclosed.

**TAM/SAM:** The creator payment automation market was valued at $3.08B in 2025, projected to reach $3.71B in 2026 and $7.72B by 2030 at a 20.1% CAGR (Research and Markets, 2026 via search snippet). The broader creator economy was estimated at $205.25B in 2024 (Grand View Research via search snippet). Goldman Sachs has estimated the creator economy TAM at $250B (Investing.com via search snippet). Grade's serviceable market is the payment infrastructure layer within creator economy transactions—no company-specific SAM estimate is publicly available.

**GTM / Distribution:** Grade lists clients including Valid ($30M+ ad spend), Astra AI (2.1M+ users), Hayai Learn (3,000+ customers), Growth Gorilla (40+ clients), and Plutus (50+ clients) as testimonials on its website (usegrade.com). [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct sales to companies managing creator programs (agencies, DTC brands, app companies running UGC campaigns), leveraging the founders' existing creator economy network from their prior venture Creator Check.

## Defensibility

Grade's primary moat signal at this stage is operational data accumulation: as more payouts are processed, the platform builds compliance records, tax documentation, and creator payment histories across jurisdictions that become costly to replicate or migrate away from. Supporting 190+ countries creates switching costs as companies would need to re-collect tax documentation and re-onboard creators on an alternative platform.

**Market structure:** General-purpose AP platforms like Tipalti and Bill.com serve thousands of industries; building native creator performance-tracking and variable compensation logic represents a niche specialization that may not justify dedicated engineering investment from a horizontal platform. [Inferred]: The structural barrier is unit economics incompatibility—Tipalti processes $75B+ in annualized volume across all industries (Tipalti press release, 2025 via search snippet), making deep vertical specialization for creator payouts a low-priority product investment relative to their broader customer base.

**Commoditization risk:** The core payment orchestration layer (sending money globally) is commoditized through Stripe, Wise, and similar infrastructure. The differentiated layer is the performance-tracking-to-payment workflow. Lumanu ($20.6M raised, Crunchbase via search snippet) and Stir ($20.7M raised, Crunchbase via search snippet) are well-funded adjacent competitors that could add similar performance-pay features. A new entrant with payments API access could replicate the basic product within months; the defensibility depends on depth of integrations and compliance tooling across 190+ countries.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **Lumanu** — $20.6M raised (Crunchbase via search snippet). Payments and financing platform for the creator economy, focused on agencies and talent managers. Differentiator vs. Grade: Lumanu offers financing/working capital to agencies, while Grade focuses on the brand-side pay-per-performance workflow. Revenue: annualized payment volume in nine figures; SaaS + fintech revenues grew 11x since Series A (Lumanu blog via search snippet).

2. **Tipalti** — $200M+ ARR (Tipalti press release, 2025 via search snippet), $200M growth financing round. Broad accounts payable automation platform serving 5,000+ companies across industries. Differentiator vs. Grade: Tipalti is horizontal/enterprise-scale; Grade is vertically specialized for creator performance-based pay with no-setup creator onboarding.

3. **Stir** — $20.7M raised (Crunchbase via search snippet), a16z-led Series A at ~$100M valuation (The Information via search snippet). Revenue-sharing platform for creators collaborating on content. Differentiator vs. Grade: Stir focuses on creator-to-creator revenue splits, while Grade focuses on company-to-creator payouts.

4. **MONET** — £17M raised (FFNews, 2025 via search snippet). Finance platform for creative agencies with campaign-based financing, payments across 130+ countries, and cash-flow forecasting. Differentiator vs. Grade: MONET targets agency back-office finance broadly (financing, banking, operations), while Grade is narrowly focused on performance-based creator payouts.

**Why now:** [Inferred]: Several converging factors enable this opportunity: (1) Creator economy ad spend is projected to reach $37B in 2025, growing 4x faster than total media industry (IAB via PR Newswire, 2025 via search snippet), driving volume of brand-to-creator transactions; (2) the shift from flat-fee influencer sponsorships to performance-based compensation models (cost-per-view, affiliate, hybrid) creates complexity that generic payment tools do not address; (3) the creator payment automation market itself is a defined and growing category at $3.08B in 2025 (Research and Markets via search snippet), indicating sufficient transaction volume to sustain vertical payment infrastructure.

**Co-founder relationship:** Both Lotanna and James worked together at Creator Check—Lotanna as CEO/Co-founder and James as CTO (from January 2023 onward per jvheaney.com and Acquire.com blog). This shared working history preceded the founding of Grade.

**Founder-market fit:** Both founders have spent years in the creator economy. Lotanna built XPO (creator payments fintech) and Creator Check (creator screening), giving him direct exposure to the brand-creator payment pain point. James built the technical infrastructure at Creator Check and has demonstrated ability to ship consumer and fintech products quickly (Pray Screen to $40K MRR in 2 months). Their combined experience across creator fintech and payment systems directly maps to the problem Grade addresses.

## Key Risks

**Brand disambiguation / SEO challenge:** "Grade" is an extremely common English word. Web searches return educational grading tools, Grade.us (review management), and other unrelated products. This creates organic discovery challenges and potential brand confusion, increasing customer acquisition cost.

**Competitor funding asymmetry:** Lumanu ($20.6M raised, Crunchbase via search snippet), Tipalti ($200M+ ARR, Tipalti press release via search snippet), and Stir ($20.7M raised at $100M valuation, The Information via search snippet) are significantly better resourced. Any of these could add performance-based payment features to their existing platforms. Mitigation: Grade's focused vertical approach and simpler onboarding may outpace feature additions by horizontal competitors.

**Platform concentration risk:** Grade's customer base appears concentrated among companies running creator/influencer campaigns—a segment that is sensitive to changes in social media platform algorithms and policies. A major platform shift (e.g., a social network internalizing creator payments) could compress the addressable market.

**Prior-product pivot ambiguity:** The founders previously operated Creator Check (a creator screening tool) and appear to have pivoted to Grade (creator payments). The relationship between the two products and the timeline of the pivot is not clearly documented in public sources, creating uncertainty about product-market fit conviction and runway already consumed.
