# Docura Health -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Docura Health is what's missing from the story: how did a UC Berkeley CS grad who interned at Rivian, Salesforce, and Cisco end up building medico-legal report automation for workers' compensation physicians? That question matters more than anything else in this dossier. When Drew Houston pitched Dropbox, the origin was instantly legible -- he kept forgetting his USB drive. When the Collisons built Stripe, they'd been building web apps and hitting the same payments wall as every other hacker. With Docura Health, I see a technically capable founder whose GitHub repos show OCR and ML document processing projects, and I see a prior healthcare AI startup (Siff AI) that lasted eight months before being discontinued. The most charitable reading is that Sachdev discovered the medico-legal bottleneck while working on Siff AI and recognized a genuine schlep that nobody else wanted to tackle. But that reading is inference, not evidence. No public source tells us how he found this problem, and founders who stumbled into something real almost always lead with that story.

The schlep itself is legitimate. Medico-legal report automation requires navigating HIPAA compliance, AMA Guides licensing for impairment rating calculations (both 5th and 6th Edition), state-specific workers' compensation regulations, and the clinical judgment overlay that physicians need to add. This is exactly the kind of tedious regulatory complexity that causes smart founders to unconsciously look away. And the physician-facing positioning is genuinely differentiated -- Supio serves plaintiff law firms, Wisedocs serves insurers, Stream Claims serves adjusters, but nobody else is building the end-to-end workflow specifically for the QME/IME evaluator. That's a real gap. But recognizing a gap from the outside is fundamentally different from discovering a pain point because you've been living with it. The gap was likely visible to anyone who spent a week studying the workers' comp ecosystem, which is how manufactured ideas get born.

The competitive landscape is what makes the solo founder problem acute rather than merely concerning. Supio has raised $91 million. Wisedocs has $14.4 million in revenue. DigitalOwl was acquired by Datavant and has enterprise distribution. Stream Claims -- also a YC company -- raised $6.8 million. Any of these could build a physician-facing module in six months. Normally I'd say the schlep and regulatory specificity create a barrier, and they do create some. But a single founder with no medical credentials and no legal background is competing against organizations that already have domain expertise embedded in their teams. I required Drew Houston to find a co-founder, and Houston had the enormous advantage of building something he deeply understood as a user. A solo founder in an unfamiliar domain needs a co-founder even more -- ideally a physician who has done hundreds of QME evaluations and can't stand the current process.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? If the YC page claims are real -- users doubling case volume, some processing 50,000+ pages monthly -- then there's genuine product-market fit with a subset of physicians. If Sachdev found this problem organically through Siff AI and has been obsessing over medico-legal workflows for over a year, the origin story is better than it appears from public data. If the AMA-compliant impairment rating engine is genuinely accurate and hard to replicate, that's a real technical moat in a domain where errors have legal consequences. And if the physician-facing niche is sticky enough that doctors won't switch once they've built report libraries in the system, the switching costs could hold off larger competitors. That's a plausible bull case. The problem is that almost every link in that chain requires assuming things not in evidence -- and I've learned that absence of evidence at this stage usually means the evidence doesn't exist, not that it was merely omitted.

Sachdev's technical credentials are the strongest signal here. The Berkeley CS degree, OCR/ML repos on GitHub, and the fact that he clearly built this product himself -- that's the one dimension where this company looks like the kind of team I'd back. He's a hacker who makes things. The Chrome extension (even with only 1 install) and the working product with physician testimonials confirm he can ship. But technical ability is necessary and insufficient. The great YC companies combine a hacker who can build with a problem that found the founder, not the other way around. Here I see a competent builder who went looking for a problem to solve -- and that ordering predicts a different class of outcome.
