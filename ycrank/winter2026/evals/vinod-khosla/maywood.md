# Maywood -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company built by insiders, for insiders, to make insiders slightly more productive. Drake Goodman comes from Blackstone private equity. Kent Goodman comes from BCG. Esteban Vizcaino comes from Balyasny. Between them they have Wharton, MIT twice, and a collective resume that any investment bank's recruiting team would frame on the wall. And what did they decide to build with all that talent and access? A tool that helps investment bankers fill out their CIMs 30% faster. The testimonial on their website says it all: "doubling our capacity" and "double our deal count next year with the same headcount." That is the consequence of success. Bankers process more paper. Nobody's life changes. No industry gets restructured. They have aimed their considerable talent at a problem whose successful resolution leaves the world operating identically, just with fewer junior analysts pulling all-nighters on formatting.

I keep coming back to the contrast with OffDeal, which raised $17M to be an AI-native investment bank -- to actually *replace* the advisory function rather than optimize it. That is a contrarian bet. Whether OffDeal succeeds or fails, the attempt carries transformational consequence. Maywood explicitly chose the opposite path: sell tools to the incumbents, don't challenge them. This is the textbook case of reducing the probability of failure until the consequence of success becomes inconsequential. The founders know what banks want because they worked at banks. They know what's considered possible because the industry told them. They are building exactly what their former employers would purchase order through a 9-month procurement cycle. That is experience functioning as a set of biases -- not preventing mistakes, but preventing invention.

The technology concern compounds this. The dossier itself states what I would have concluded independently: "the core technology -- applying LLMs to generate financial documents -- is replicable by well-funded competitors." Datasite just acquired both Grata for $200M and Blueflame AI, and CapVest committed $500M to expand its capabilities. Datasite already has distribution into the banks Maywood needs to sell to -- those banks already use Datasite's data rooms. When Datasite integrates AI content generation into its existing platform, Maywood's value proposition evaporates. This is not a technology moat; it is a timing advantage measured in quarters, not years. Esteban's ICML publication demonstrates genuine ML research ability, but the paper is on solving PDEs with neural nets -- orthogonal to financial document generation. There is no proprietary model architecture here that Datasite or Bloomberg or S&P could not replicate with a fraction of their R&D budgets.

The strongest bull case requires believing two things simultaneously: first, that Maywood's firm-specific data integration creates durable switching costs that protect against Datasite's consolidation; and second, that the M&A execution software market is large enough to support a venture-scale outcome. Both are plausible. SOC 2 Type II certification at pre-seed is genuinely impressive execution -- most startups at this stage haven't thought about compliance. If Maywood embeds deeply enough into several banks' workflows before Datasite's AI integration matures, they could build the kind of enterprise stickiness that makes displacement expensive. The timing on LLM capabilities is real -- generating client-ready CIMs with proper formatting and domain-specific language was not feasible before 2023, and the team arrived at the window early enough to establish relationships. If I were evaluating purely on business-building merit -- probability of achieving a $500M outcome -- I'd give this team meaningful odds. They know the buyer, they have the credentials to get meetings, and they are executing with discipline.

But I do not optimize for probability of a $500M outcome. I optimize for consequence of success at a magnitude that justifies the attempt. If Maywood captures the entire M&A execution software market, investment banks still operate the same way. Deals still take 6-9 months. The advisory industry still charges the same fees. Capital still flows through the same intermediaries. The world is not different -- just faster at producing PDFs. These three founders are too talented to spend their careers on a problem this contained. The Blackstone experience, the MIT research credentials, the BCG automation expertise -- they could be attacking a system that actually needs replacing, not one that needs a better copilot.
