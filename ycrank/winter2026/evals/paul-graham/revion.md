# Revion -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Revion is a tension that's hard to resolve. On one hand, the problem is genuinely schlepy in a way that should scare off competitors. Automotive service departments run on DMS systems from the 1990s. OEM warranty compliance has its own arcane language. Technicians work with their hands under car hoods and can't touch a keyboard. Building integrations with CDK Global and Reynolds & Reynolds is the kind of soul-crushing infrastructure work that causes smart people to unconsciously look the other way. This is real schlep territory. On the other hand, when I look at how the founders found this problem, I see investment bankers from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, an AI researcher from Georgia Tech, and zero documented connection to the automotive industry. The schlep is there. The organic discovery isn't.

This matters more than it might seem. When the Collison brothers built Stripe, they were programmers who had personally experienced the pain of integrating payments. The idea was so obvious to them they couldn't not build it. When I look at Revion's founding team -- an LSE finance grad, an Imperial/Georgia Tech AI researcher, and an Imperial engineer from Susquehanna -- I see people who identified an underserved vertical through market analysis. Smart people with impressive credentials noticing that automotive service is ripe for AI. That's not inherently disqualifying. But it changes the risk profile. When founders discover a problem organically, they have years of accumulated intuition about the domain. When they discover it through research, every domain insight has to be learned on the job, and their competitors -- the ones with 20 years of dealership relationships -- don't need that learning curve.

The bull case is that this is a DoorDash-type story. Tony Xu wasn't a restaurant owner. He was a Stanford MBA who identified the delivery problem from outside, then compensated by personally delivering food to understand the business from the inside out. Revion might be doing the same thing. The traction signals are more concrete than I'd expect at pre-seed: Ewing Automotive Group reporting 30,000 billable hours recovered annually and a 15% increase in repair order count, a single dealership capturing $264,000 in lost revenue through 12,000 AI-handled calls in three months, an endorsement from Mercedes-Benz of Plano's Fixed Operations Director. These aren't vague claims. They're specific, named, and quantified. Building integrations with nine DMS/CRM platforms -- CDK, Tekion, Xtime, Cox, Keyloop -- is itself an execution signal. That's painful work that most startups would avoid, which is exactly the kind of schlep willingness I look for.

On the technical side, Hanbo Xie is a real builder. PhD research in reinforcement learning and LLMs at Georgia Tech, engineering at Terra from age 18, Goldman derivatives trading, IBM research at Imperial. The combination of AI research depth and engineering experience is the right profile for building voice-first AI that works in a noisy shop environment. Felipe Mendes adds engineering density from Susquehanna and IBM. They've shipped a working product that real technicians use daily. But I notice the GitHub footprint is modest -- 23 public repos, top repo with 3 stars -- and the team's identity leans more "quantitative finance meets AI research" than "hacker who stays up all night because the code is interesting." These are smart, accomplished people, but I don't get the sense they'd be building automotive technician tools if they hadn't decided to start a company.

The competitive landscape is the other worry. Impel has $126 million. Tekion has $600 million and a $4 billion valuation. CDK Global does $2 billion in revenue and serves 30,000 dealerships. These aren't theoretical competitors. Any of them could build a voice-first technician tool as a feature. Revion's defense is that incumbents face business model cannibalization risk -- CDK can't easily sell a point solution that highlights gaps in their own platform. That's a real structural advantage, but it's temporary. The underlying technology -- voice-to-text, LLM narrative generation, scheduling agents -- is commodity AI wrapped in automotive domain knowledge. The question is whether Revion can accumulate enough dealership workflow data and integration depth to build a moat before the incumbents decide to move.

I keep coming back to the absent organic backstory. If one of these founders had spent five years managing a service department, or had a parent who ran a dealership, or had personally experienced the frustration of getting their car serviced and thought "this is insane" -- I'd feel differently. The traction suggests they're executing. The schlep they've chosen is real. But the motivation reads as market-driven rather than problem-driven, and in my experience, the companies that survive the years of painful execution in unglamorous verticals are the ones where the founders can't imagine working on anything else. I don't have enough evidence to conclude that about Revion.
