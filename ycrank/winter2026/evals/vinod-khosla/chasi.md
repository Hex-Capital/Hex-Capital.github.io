# Chasi -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company that has taken two genuinely capable founders -- people who deployed AI at Boeing, Cummins, Harley Davidson, who built supply chain software at Tesla -- and channeled all that talent into making equipment dealers answer their phones faster. The consequence of full success is what, exactly? Dealerships close 15% more quotes. Fleet utilization improves from 58% to 70%. These are operationally meaningful numbers for the businesses involved, and they would produce a real SaaS company. But nobody's world changes. No industry structure gets overturned. One-third of the cost to build the physical world goes to equipment, and Chasi's response to that staggering fact is to automate the follow-up email. They have looked at a trillion-dollar system and decided to optimize its voicemail.

What strikes me most is the deliberate choice to be complementary rather than disruptive. The dossier states this explicitly: Chasi is "positioned as a complementary overlay that integrates with existing systems rather than replacing them." This is not a limitation imposed by circumstance -- it is a strategic decision. They have chosen to sit on top of Texada and InTempo rather than making them obsolete. When I backed Square, Jack Dorsey did not build a better credit card terminal. He made the entire POS infrastructure irrelevant by reimagining how payments work at the point of sale. Chasi has done the opposite: they have accepted the architecture of the current system and offered to make it work slightly better. That acceptance is a ceiling on ambition, and it is a ceiling I cannot invest through.

The technology itself -- LLM-powered conversational agents for sales automation -- is rapidly commoditizing. Every major AI lab and dozens of startups are building sales agents. Chasi's differentiation is vertical domain knowledge: understanding the difference between a rental inquiry and a service request, knowing equipment specifications, handling fleet scheduling nuances. That knowledge is real and valuable, but it is not a technology moat. It is a workflow integration moat, which is a different and weaker thing. Moab just emerged with $16M in funding and a team from Uber and Ramp building a full equipment dealer operating system. Adding an AI communication layer to a modern ERP platform is a feature decision, not a company-building challenge. When your differentiation can be replicated as a feature sprint by a better-funded competitor, you are in a race you may not win.

The bull case deserves honest examination. The equipment dealer vertical is large, genuinely underserved by technology, and the founders have precisely the relationships and domain understanding to penetrate it. Their Axion Ray experience is not generic -- they sold AI to industrial companies, they understand the procurement cycles, the skepticism, the integration challenges. If Chasi captures the commercial interaction layer across enough dealers, the data flywheel could become genuinely powerful: pricing signals, demand patterns, response-time-to-close correlations across the industry. That data asset, if built, would be proprietary and defensible. And the AED Ambassador partnership suggests they are earning institutional trust in the industry. For an investor optimizing for probability of a 5-10x return in a vertical SaaS play, this is an attractive bet. But I do not optimize for probability of modest returns. I optimize for consequence of success at full scale, and at full scale, Chasi is a better-run equipment dealership, not a transformed equipment industry.

The founders are insiders, not outsiders. They come from the exact industry they are serving, carrying the exact playbook they ran at Axion Ray. My experience is that people with deep industry knowledge aim for the improvement they know is achievable rather than the invention they do not know is impossible. These founders know that equipment dealers miss calls and lose quotes -- because they spent years watching it happen at Axion Ray's customers. So they built a solution for the problem they observed. That is sensible engineering, and it is the opposite of what produced Juniper, Impossible Foods, or Rocket Lab. Those companies were built by people who did not know what the incumbents considered impossible, which freed them to attempt it. Akash and Sarman know this industry well enough to build exactly what it says it needs, which is precisely why they will not build what it does not yet know it needs.

The timing is reasonable but not ahead of any curve. LLMs reaching production quality for domain-specific conversation is a 2023-2024 consensus development. Every VC in America knows that vertical AI agents are the next wave. This is not skating to where the puck will be -- this is arriving at the arena the same time as everyone else, just picking a less crowded section. Credit to the founders for choosing an underserved vertical, but the underlying technology trend is fully mainstream, and the equipment dealer niche, while large, does not have the exponential dynamics that compound early positioning into insurmountable advantage.

I pass. These are talented founders building a sensible business in a real market. That is exactly the profile I avoid. They have reduced their risk of failure to the point where success, when it comes, will be a solid vertical SaaS exit -- not the kind of outcome that justifies the opportunity cost of two people this capable spending a decade on it. I would tell them: you have the skills and the relationships to attempt something genuinely transformative in industrial technology. Go find the version of this problem where success means the equipment industry operates in a fundamentally different way.
