# Confluence Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately: this is one of the most popular categories in venture right now. "AI for science" has Lila Sciences raising $200M seeds, CuspAI closing $100M Series A rounds, Periodic Labs pulling in $300M -- all in 2025 alone. Poetiq, which is doing adjacent work on sample-efficient reasoning, just raised $45.8M. When I look at Confluence Labs, I see a two-person pre-seed team entering a space where dozens of well-capitalized competitors are already operating with domain-specific data assets, enterprise partnerships with BASF and LG Chem, and in Recursion's case, actual robotic labs running millions of experiments weekly. The most promising companies I've backed have been deeply unpopular at the time. SpaceX when everyone thought private rockets were a fantasy. Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like something a bored engineer sketched on a napkin. "AI research lab focused on learning efficiency" in 2026 does not make anyone uncomfortable. It makes VCs open their checkbooks. That's exactly the signal that tells me the weirdness has been arbitraged away before these founders even arrived.

The founder question is where I always start, and it's where this one falls quiet for me. Brent Burdick being a college dropout and self-taught engineer -- I feel that in my bones. I was self-taught too, reading programming books at the Tempe public library. I know what it takes to build yourself from nothing. But when I ask the question I always ask -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- I need to hear why THIS person is solving THIS problem. Why is a self-taught engineer who built VS Code extensions and startup MVPs now designing experiments for pharmaceutical R&D teams? What's the lived experience with data-sparse science? Niranjan Baskaran has the research credentials -- RSI, ISEF, math awards, experimental psychology work at Vassar -- which maps to the intellectual territory. But that's accomplished-student energy, not someone who's been forged by a specific hardship into solving a specific problem. I don't see the biographical thread that tells me these founders will still be grinding on experiment design for materials scientists when things get really hard, the way the Crusoe founders kept pushing on energy-to-compute even when Bitcoin collapsed.

The 97.9% on ARC-AGI-2 is genuinely impressive technical work -- I won't dismiss that. When frontier LLMs score 0% and the best commercial systems managed 37.6%, getting to near-perfect accuracy demonstrates real capability in data-efficient reasoning. That's a proof of intellect. But they open-sourced the entire solver under MIT license, which means anyone with access to frontier models can reproduce the methodology. And ARC-AGI-2 is synthetic grid puzzles, not drug design or materials engineering. The gap between "we can solve abstract pattern recognition from a few examples" and "we can tell a pharma R&D team which experiment to run next" is enormous. No paying customers, no pilot deployments, no revenue -- the benchmark is the entire story right now. Selling to enterprise R&D organizations requires domain credibility and long sales cycles that these early-career founders haven't demonstrated they can navigate.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because I try to be fair. If I squint, there's something here that reminds me of how Crusoe started with one weird capability -- mining Bitcoin on stranded natural gas -- and it turned out the underlying insight about bringing compute to cheap energy was a platform that eventually supported AI infrastructure worth $3 billion. If Confluence Labs' "data-efficient learning" is similarly a platform capability that can be applied across domains, and if these two young founders can find the right wedge into one specific vertical and accumulate proprietary domain data through client work, this could compound into something real. The timing argument also has merit: frontier LLM costs are dropping, making compute-intensive experiment design newly economical. And being domain-agnostic could be an advantage if the competitors are locked into materials or molecules. But for this bull case to work, you need the founders to successfully navigate enterprise sales in scientific domains where they have no track record, build defensibility beyond an open-source benchmark solver, and outrun teams with 50-100x their capital. That's not insurmountable technology risk -- it's insurmountable execution risk stacked on unproven domain access.

The economic access dimension is absent here. My best investments created real opportunity for real people who didn't have it before. Uber gave drivers income. Postmates put money in delivery workers' pockets. Affirm made credit transparent. When I look at Confluence Labs, I see a tool that would make already well-funded R&D organizations slightly more efficient. Eventually that could mean cheaper drugs or better materials, but that's three or four steps removed from the people who actually need help. There's nothing wrong with enterprise B2B, but it doesn't light up the part of my brain that asks whether this company is making an invisible system visible or creating access where none existed.

I respect the technical chops and I respect anyone who drops out and teaches themselves to build. But this doesn't match how I invest. It's consensus AI in a crowded market, the founders' biographical connection to the problem domain is thin, there's no defensible moat beyond a benchmark score they gave away, and the economic access angle is absent. I'd want to hear their story in person -- I might be wrong about the biographical thread, and that's the kind of thing you can only feel in the room. But on what I can see, this is a pass.
