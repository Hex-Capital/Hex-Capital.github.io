# Aurorin CAD -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that strikes me hardest about Aurorin is the sheer audacity of one person deciding to build a CAD kernel from scratch. Parasolid and ACIS -- the engines under SolidWorks, NX, and nearly every professional CAD tool on earth -- were built by teams of dozens over decades. Michael Baron looked at that and said, "I'll do it myself." That ambition reminds me of the kind of founder energy I felt around SpaceX, where the technical challenge was so enormous that most rational people dismissed it as impossible. And Baron has a resume that makes the attempt plausible: three SpaceX internships spanning propulsion simulation, guidance navigation, and flight software, plus Apple GPU driver work, plus a four-year solo project building a multi-GPU graphics engine that rendered entire cityscapes at high frame rates. The technical credentials are real. But credentials and story are different things, and when I think about what makes me write a check, I keep coming back to the question I always ask first -- not "what are you building?" but "how did you get here? What happened to you that made this the problem you'd bet your life on?"

And that's where I get stuck. The dossier gives me a talented young engineer with exactly the right skillset to attempt this, but no window into why. What's the personal stake? Did he spend years watching hardware teams grind through SolidWorks and feel the pain in his bones? Did something break for him -- a project that failed because the tools were too slow, a team he was on that missed a window because of CAD bottlenecks? I don't know, because there's no biographical narrative connecting Michael Baron the person to the mechanical CAD problem. He might have one -- founders this early often haven't learned to lead with it yet -- but from what I can see, this reads more like a technically excellent person spotting a capability gap than someone solving a problem forged from their own experience. That matters to me because the founders who persist through the darkest moments, when the company is burning and nothing works, are the ones who can't imagine doing anything else. A technically motivated founder might pivot to the next interesting problem when this one gets brutal.

The other thing I notice is that "AI-native CAD" has become a category. Zoo raised $10 million, Adam AI raised $4 million, Hestus raised $1.5 million, and PTC launched an AI Advisor on Onshape in October 2025. The idea that AI should transform how engineers design hardware is no longer weird -- it's the kind of thing that gets 176,000 views on a YC launch tweet. Now, Baron's specific approach -- building the kernel itself rather than wrapping existing engines or bolting a chatbot onto SolidWorks -- is genuinely differentiated and harder to replicate. That distinction within the category is interesting. But the category itself is heating up, and I've learned that the most promising companies are the ones nobody else wants to fund. When I backed Crusoe, nobody was talking about "flare gas compute" as a venture category. The loneliness of the bet was part of the signal. Aurorin is entering a space with multiple funded competitors and active incumbents. That doesn't make it wrong, but it doesn't give me the contrarian conviction I need.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because it's a real one. If I'm wrong about this, it's because building the kernel is the move that matters most and everyone else in the AI-CAD space skipped it. Zoo, Adam, and Hestus are all working at higher layers -- text prompts, copilots, API wrappers. Aurorin is going deeper, building the foundation that lets AI manipulate geometry natively rather than through legacy interfaces. That's the kind of structural infrastructure bet I've made before and been rewarded for. The incumbents genuinely can't rebuild their kernels without breaking backward compatibility with millions of existing designs and certified manufacturing workflows -- that's a real moat for whoever builds the modern alternative first. And Baron's multi-year graphics engine project shows he can actually ship complex systems software alone. If this works, the switching costs compound and you end up with something like what Onshape tried to be but with AI native to the core. For this to be a great investment, I'd need to believe that Baron has the staying power to spend three to five years on kernel development as a solo founder without burning out, that file format compatibility gets solved, and that the market shifts from "interesting AI demo" to "I'm going to move my production workflows off SolidWorks." All possible. But the biographical signal that would give me conviction about the first condition isn't there yet.

The economic access dimension is essentially absent from my reading. This helps hardware engineers work faster -- worthwhile, but these are well-compensated professionals at funded companies. I don't see the thread I traced through Uber, Postmates, Affirm, and Thumbtack, where a product creates income or transparency for people who previously lacked it. CAD tools don't make invisible systems visible or expand economic participation. That's not a fatal flaw for every investor, but for me it means a whole dimension of conviction is missing.

Being a solo founder on something this technically ambitious concerns me for a different reason than co-founder conflict. I lost sleep over HQ Trivia because two founders couldn't resolve their disagreements. Here the risk is the opposite: one person carrying the weight of kernel development, AI integration, desktop application engineering, user acquisition, and fundraising simultaneously, with no partner to share the load or challenge their thinking. CAD kernels aren't weekend projects -- they're cathedral-scale engineering that historically required teams. Baron's talent is evident, but talent without resilience infrastructure is fragile, and I don't see the support system yet.
