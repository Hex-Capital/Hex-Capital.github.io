# Proximitty -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The schlep in loan collections is genuine and enormous. FDCPA, TCPA, CFPB, FCRA, SCRA, state-level consumer protection laws, distressed borrowers, legacy loan management systems, compliance liability -- this is the kind of ugly, regulated, thankless work that makes most AI founders instinctively look the other way. They'd rather build copilots for developers. Every programmer knows that dealing with banks and regulatory bodies is painful. Stripe succeeded precisely because the Collisons walked into that pain while thousands of other hackers consciously or unconsciously avoided it. Proximitty has identified a domain where schlep blindness is operating at full force. That's the good news. The question I can't answer is whether these founders found this problem or manufactured it.

When I look at the founders' backgrounds, I see smart, capable people -- but I don't see someone who worked in collections and couldn't stand how broken it was. Ho led growth at Taptap Send, a remittance fintech. That's adjacent to lending the way building houses is adjacent to selling furniture -- you're in the same neighborhood, but the daily work is fundamentally different. McKinsey before that. Zhang spent five years at Bloomberg on security infrastructure. Neither founder appears to have spent time inside a collections operation, watched agents toggle between four disconnected systems, or personally navigated the FDCPA compliance maze. The strongest ideas come from founders who can tell you the exact moment they encountered the problem. Here, the idea reads like it emerged from a market map: "large TAM, heavy regulation, fragmented incumbents, AI enables new approach." That's not a bad framework for identifying opportunities. But it's analysis, not discovery, and the difference matters for the decade of painful execution ahead.

Zhang's technical credentials are the strongest signal in this dossier. Maintaining ACI.dev -- an open-source AI agent tool-calling platform with 4,700 GitHub stars -- is not a weekend project. It's directly relevant infrastructure for what Proximitty claims to build. Five years of security and data streaming engineering at Bloomberg adds depth. This is a CTO who builds things. That said, ACI.dev apparently raised $3M as its own company, and Zhang's LinkedIn still references it in the present tense. I'd want to understand where that commitment begins and ends. But the core signal is clear: there's a real hacker-founder on this team who has already demonstrated the ability to build AI agent tooling that other developers actually use.

What concerns me is scope. Proximitty claims to be building a unified lending data layer, three categories of AI agents (right-party contact, collections, compliance), voice capabilities, omni-channel outreach, real-time multi-regulation monitoring, AND no-code browser automation via computer vision. For two people. The best startups I've funded started deliberately narrow -- Facebook at Harvard, Stripe for developers only. You keep the fire contained to get it really hot before adding logs. This feature list reads like a pitch deck designed to cover every possible customer objection rather than a product built from one core insight executed with obsessive depth. When Stripe launched, it did one thing: make it easy for developers to accept payments with seven lines of code. Everything else came later.

The bull case is real and worth taking seriously. If the claim of serving "publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" is accurate, that would be extraordinary for a pre-seed company in a market with 6-18 month sales cycles. Enterprise customers in regulated finance don't trial software casually -- if real institutions are using this, that's demand signal you can't fake. The timing convergence is also legitimate: LLMs just became capable enough for regulation-compliant conversations, BNPL portfolios are flooding collections pipelines, and Regulation F has made manual compliance monitoring unsustainable at scale. If you squint, this could be a company that moves fast enough to establish the data moat before Prodigal's proAgent and LoanPro's inevitable AI features catch up. The schlep itself is the moat -- the regulatory complexity deters not just founders but also incumbent product teams who don't want to risk autonomous AI agents on live borrower interactions.

But I can't invest on "if." The customer claim is conspicuously vague -- no names, no metrics, no case studies. Prodigal is YC-backed with $14.2M, years of production data from real lenders, and launched proAgent in 2025 converging directly on this space. The organic discovery signal that matters most in my framework simply isn't here. These are competent founders attacking a real problem with real schlep -- but the idea feels identified rather than discovered, and the product scope suggests they haven't yet achieved the clarity that comes from deeply understanding one specific user's one specific pain point.
