# Oxus -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I want to know about any startup is how the founders found the problem. Not whether the problem exists -- SOX compliance is obviously painful and expensive -- but whether these specific founders stumbled into it through their own experience or selected it from a menu of large, boring markets where AI seems applicable. And here I can't find the organic origin story. Janet Liu worked at the Fed and D.E. Shaw in investment strategy. Melinda Liu was in finance at JPMorgan and built fintech AI products. Christine Watts did ML engineering and BCG consulting. These are all finance-adjacent roles. But internal audit is a very specific discipline, and none of these founders appear to have actually sat in an audit room, wrestled with workpapers at 2am before a filing deadline, or been the person responsible for a SOX control test. Being in the same building where auditors work is not the same as being an auditor. When I don't see the organic backstory, my prior shifts toward this being a market-selection exercise -- three smart MIT graduates who identified a large regulated market where LLMs could create value. That's not wrong, exactly. It's just how most of the ideas I pass on get started.

The schlep analysis is more interesting. SOX audit automation is genuinely ugly work -- regulatory documentation standards, evidence chains, control testing methodology, annual compliance cycles, and deeply conservative buyers who face real consequences for errors. Most technical people unconsciously filter this out, which is exactly the dynamic I described in "Schlep Blindness." The problem is real, and the fact that AuditBoard and Workiva are legacy tools bolted onto pre-LLM architectures confirms that nobody has properly attacked this from an AI-native angle for in-house audit teams specifically. But the schlep-blindness framework works best when the founders are tackling a problem they personally couldn't escape -- the Collisons didn't choose payments from a spreadsheet; they'd been coding web apps and hitting the same broken payment integration over and over. Here the schlep exists, and these founders are willing to walk into it, but willingness and organic discovery are different things.

The strongest bull case is that the competitive positioning is actually quite precise. Fieldguide serves external CPA firms. Denki is a services-replacement model. AuditBoard and Workiva are workflow trackers, not AI-native output generators. Oxus is building tools for in-house internal audit teams -- a segment that sits in a gap between all of these. If you're a Chief Audit Executive at a recently-public company with a small team and a mandatory SOX obligation, none of the existing options automate the actual production of your deliverables. That's a real wedge. And the CPA talent shortage creates genuine urgency on the buyer side. If Oxus can land five or ten of these customers and build institutional knowledge into the platform -- scoping templates, control documentation structures, company-specific patterns -- the switching costs compound quickly because audit teams operate on annual cycles. The narrow initial market (4,000-5,000 US public companies) could be the "start deliberately narrow" strategy that works -- Facebook launched at Harvard only, Stripe launched for developers only. But the key difference is that Zuckerberg was a Harvard student and the Collisons were developers. The founders were their own first users. I don't see that here.

On the team: Christine Watts has the strongest technical signal -- MIT AI degree plus ML systems engineering at startups. The fact that she apparently got into YC as a 19-year-old solo founder (possibly a prior venture) suggests real capability and ambition. But I can't find any public GitHub repos, open-source work, or visible evidence of what the team has actually built. The website describes four distinct product modules (control testing, walkthrough generation, SOX scoping, document intelligence), which is ambitious for a three-person pre-seed team. I'd want to see the actual product. The three founders being MIT contemporaries with overlapping degrees is a positive signal for co-founder relationship quality -- better than strangers who met at a co-founder matching event. But the absence of visible technical output at this stage gives me pause.

What would change my mind: if I could sit down with these founders and hear that one of them spent a summer embedded with an internal audit team and was horrified by the manual workpaper process. Or if they could show me three paying customers who found the product and told colleagues about it without being asked. Or if Christine had built something technically impressive enough that I'd describe her as "an animal" at AI engineering. Any of those signals would substantially shift my assessment. The pieces are all reasonable -- real problem, real schlep, credentialed team, precise market wedge. What's missing is the spark of organic necessity that separates companies built because the founders couldn't not build them from companies built because the founders decided to start a startup.
