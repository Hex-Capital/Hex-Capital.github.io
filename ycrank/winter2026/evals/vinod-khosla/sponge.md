# Sponge -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Sponge: when I count the competitors in this dossier, I find Catena Labs ($18M), Skyfire ($9.5M), Natural ($9.8M), Payman AI ($13.8M), Coinbase AgentKit, Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite, Visa Intelligent Commerce, and Mastercard Agent Pay -- all shipping or announced within the same twelve-month window. That's not a contrarian bet. That's a consensus. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's CTO publicly said they'd never build a TCP/IP router. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, the AI community thought it was a research lab without commercial potential. The best signal I know is when incumbents and experts dismiss you. Here, incumbents are validating you. Stripe, these founders' own former employer, launched the same category product in February 2026. When your former boss launches your product as a feature, that tells me you're building in a space where the idea is obvious enough for the largest payments company on earth to pursue it as a line extension.

The consequence magnitude question is where this evaluation sharpens. If Sponge succeeds completely -- wins the agent payments infrastructure layer -- what changes? Agents can transact without human approval. That's useful plumbing. But the transformation is the agent economy itself, not the payments pipe that serves it. Sponge doesn't create AI agents, doesn't make them more capable, doesn't solve a problem that changes how industries operate. It adapts existing financial infrastructure -- wallets, cards, crypto rails -- to serve a new customer type. The best-case comparison is Square, which made mobile payments possible for millions of small merchants who'd never had card acceptance. But Square created a capability that genuinely didn't exist before. Sponge is extending payment capabilities that already exist (Stripe, Coinbase, traditional banking) to a new buyer category. The magnitude of that success, in a market where eight well-resourced competitors are doing the same thing, is a competent payments business in a crowded vertical. That's not a problem too important not to work on -- it's a commercial opportunity that several dozen smart people have independently identified.

The founding team epitomizes a pattern I typically avoid: industry insiders executing an industry playbook. Three engineers from Stripe's crypto division, building payments infrastructure that looks architecturally like what they built at Stripe, for a new customer type. Their domain expertise is undeniable -- they literally constructed stablecoin financial accounts and core money movement systems at one of the best payments companies ever built. But that expertise is a set of biases. They see the agent payments problem through Stripe's lens: SDK integration, wallet provisioning, gateway onboarding. That's competent infrastructure engineering, not a reconception of how financial systems should work in an agent-native world. Where's the outsider thinking? Where's the naive question that a payments veteran would never ask? I don't see a Pat Brown asking why we need cows, or a Peter Beck asking why rockets cost $100 million. I see three payments engineers building a payments product.

Let me steelman this. The bull case is real: if AI agents become the dominant economic actors within five years -- handling procurement, negotiating contracts, executing transactions at machine speed -- the financial infrastructure layer captures enormous value, potentially winner-take-most through network effects. The Gateway product is a clever wedge: businesses upload an API spec and agents can self-onboard, creating a two-sided marketplace that could compound. These founders have the technical credibility to build it fast. YC gives them distribution into exactly the developer community building agents. And the timing trajectory is genuinely favorable -- agent capability is on an exponential curve, and we're early enough that the infrastructure layer hasn't consolidated. If I believed this team would build a payments network for agents the way Stripe built it for internet commerce -- and if I believed they'd win against Stripe itself, Coinbase, and a half-dozen funded competitors doing the same thing -- the return could be significant. The fiat-plus-crypto hybrid is a real differentiator against crypto-only competitors like Skyfire and Coinbase AgentKit, even if anyone can eventually replicate it.

But I keep returning to my framework. The rate-of-change dimension is the strongest argument for Sponge, and even there, the signal is mixed. Yes, AI agents are improving exponentially. Yes, the demand for agent financial primitives will grow. But that exponential curve benefits every player in this space equally. When I evaluated OpenAI in 2019, the rate of change was visible but not yet consensus -- I was one of the first institutional investors to track it. The agent payments curve is consensus in February 2026. Stripe sees it. Visa sees it. a16z is funding Catena Labs. This isn't skating to where the puck will be; it's arriving at the same spot as every other player on the ice. The technology itself -- TypeScript SDK, MCP integration, multi-chain support -- is integration engineering, not a breakthrough that makes the existing approach uneconomic. Nothing in the dossier suggests a 10x structural advantage. This team has reduced risk admirably: experienced founders, validated market, proven technology stack. And in doing so, they've narrowed the aperture of what success looks like to a competitive payments middleware business. The money probably doesn't expire worthless, but it probably doesn't produce a transformational outcome either. That's the middle ground my portfolio construction is designed to avoid.
