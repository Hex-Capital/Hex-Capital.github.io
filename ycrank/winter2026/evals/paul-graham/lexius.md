# Lexius -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Lexius is that this is not a schlep blindness opportunity. Schlep blindness means everyone knows the problem exists but unconsciously avoids it because the work is ugly. Retail theft detection via computer vision is the opposite -- Veesion has raised €53M and deployed in 5,000+ stores, Everseen has $113M, Auror just did an NZ$82M Series C. The problem has been seen, the schlep has been accepted, and the battle lines are drawn. When a $500K pre-seed company enters a market where the lead competitor has a hundred times their capital and is opening a U.S. office this year, the question isn't "is this a real problem?" but "why will you win?" The answer can't just be "we're focused on U.S. SMBs" -- that's a positioning statement, not a moat.

The deeper concern is how this idea was found. Neither founder has any visible connection to retail, loss prevention, or store operations. David Elskamp ran a media agency and studied data science. Liam Webster studied EECS at Berkeley and did privacy research. The origin story reads like a technically capable team scanning for markets where computer vision could be applied -- and landing on retail theft because the TAM is enormous and the pitch is intuitive. That's the exact failure mode I've written about: smart people generating ideas that sound good on a slide but don't emerge from personal necessity. Nobody at Lexius was running a bodega and getting robbed. Nobody was working LP and frustrated by the tools. The idea was built from the outside in, which means the founders' intuitions about what retailers actually need will be borrowed rather than felt. When Stripe worked, it worked partly because the Collisons were programmers who personally hated integrating payment APIs. That kind of founder-problem entanglement is absent here.

The bull case deserves serious attention. The FineFare deployment -- 63% theft reduction, $3,520/month prevented, 12x ROI over 30 days -- is a genuinely strong customer outcome metric. If that's reproducible, the product sells itself. The claim that 4,000+ stores expressed interest without marketing, and that the waitlist "exploded" organically, would be an extraordinary pull signal if independently verified. And 15-minute remote installation is the kind of frictionless onboarding that can accelerate adoption in a fragmented market of small store owners who don't want to deal with complex deployments. If Veesion stumbles on its U.S. expansion -- navigating a different regulatory environment, different camera ecosystems, different retailer expectations -- there's a window. The privacy-first positioning (no biometrics, movement-only analysis) could become a regulatory advantage as AI surveillance law evolves. If all of that breaks right, Lexius could own U.S. SMB retail security before the European incumbents figure out American go-to-market.

But that bull case requires multiple things to go right simultaneously, which triggers one of my clearest red flags. Lexius needs Veesion's U.S. expansion to falter AND the 4,000-store interest pipeline to convert AND their detection accuracy to hold up across diverse real-world environments without generating the false positives that create legal liability. Each additional miracle multiplies the risk. And the founding date ambiguity bothers me -- if this company has been building since 2022, which the Crunchbase data and Coop Vandaag deployment suggest, then three-plus years of work has yielded three documented customers. That's not the trajectory of a product that people are pulling toward themselves. That's the trajectory of a product that's struggling to find fit.

Elskamp does show genuine entrepreneurial grit -- building a profitable agency from age 14, winning entrepreneurship awards, making the leap from the Netherlands to San Francisco. That's not nothing. And Webster brings real technical grounding in ML and privacy from Berkeley's ICSI lab. They've built a working system that's deployed in production and generating measurable results for at least one customer. But I don't see evidence of the specific creative resourcefulness that distinguishes great founders from good ones. No unexpected pivots, no lateral solutions to impossible constraints, no cereal-box moments. The path has been relatively linear: build CV model, deploy at stores, apply to YC. Linear paths work when you have a structural advantage. They don't work when you're outgunned a hundred to one on capital.

This is a competent team applying accessible technology to a well-understood problem in a market where well-funded competitors are already executing. The schlep that matters here -- selling to thousands of individual store owners, managing false positive liability, navigating privacy regulation -- favors organizations with more resources, not less. I'd need to see either a dramatically different origin story connecting these founders to retail at a visceral level, or evidence that their technology is meaningfully superior to Veesion's, or proof that the 4,000-store pipeline is converting into revenue. Without those signals, this is a pass.
