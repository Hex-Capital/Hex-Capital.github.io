# Pollinate -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Two pivots in under two years is the first thing I see. Hospitality app for partygoers, then food wholesale supply chain, then hard tech and deep tech manufacturing in the US. At pre-seed this isn't automatically disqualifying -- Stripe's first product wasn't Stripe either -- but the pattern matters. The question is whether these pivots represent customer-driven discovery or thesis-free wandering. The dossier suggests the former: the founders physically delivered wholesale vegetables and shadowed manufacturing facility staff, which means they were close enough to customers to hear the real pain. But the distance between "connecting partygoers with clubs" and "ERP agent automation for deep tech manufacturers" is large enough that I'd want to understand how much of their current domain knowledge is six months old versus structural.

The market structural moment here is real but generic. LLM capabilities crossing a threshold for reliable document extraction from unstructured invoices, POs, and emails -- that's the "why now." The problem is that this identical "why now" applies to Ovlo, Lighthouz AI, Levelpath's AI features, and probably fifty other startups I haven't seen yet. When I invested in companies like PagerDuty or Gusto, the structural moment was specific to THAT company's market entry: operations alerting had no modern SaaS competitor, and payroll for small businesses was still being done by ADP and manual accountants. Supply chain ERP automation, by contrast, has $100M+ funded competitors (Levelpath), $118M funded competitors with $29M revenue (Order.co), a 40-year incumbent processing 2 billion invoices (Basware), AND a direct YC batchmate (Ovlo) with overlapping positioning. This isn't a non-obvious market -- "AI for supply chain" is consensus enough that Research & Markets has already published a specific "AI Purchase Order Matching" market report with a 24.8% CAGR projection. When the market research firms have carved out your exact category and assigned it a growth rate, the asymmetric information advantage that drives outsized returns is gone.

The 80/20 model concerns me structurally. Eighty percent platform, twenty percent bespoke customization per customer. With a two-person team, that twenty percent creates a consulting-like delivery constraint that limits scalability. This is the distinction I draw between software-driven and software-aware: if each customer requires meaningful custom work to deploy, the margin structure looks more like Accenture than Stripe. The ERP integration layer itself could create switching costs -- once a customer's workflows depend on Pollinate's agents, ripping it out is painful -- but building integrations across the heterogeneous ERP landscape (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Dynamics, dozens of smaller systems) is a massive engineering surface area for two people. Each new ERP connector is a discrete engineering investment, and incumbents like SAP have no incentive to make this easy.

The bull case I take seriously: supply chain execution IS genuinely "boring but critical" infrastructure -- the archetype I've historically had highest conviction in. Every manufacturer needs it, nobody enjoys managing it, and the gap between how enterprises actually run supply chains (spreadsheets, email inboxes, phone calls) and how they should run them (automated, cross-system, agent-driven) is enormous. If the ERP ontology layer works -- if Pollinate genuinely builds a structured data model that sits across multiple ERPs and enables agents to operate autonomously -- that ontology becomes a distribution channel for additional workflow automation, similar to how Samsara's sensor data layer became a distribution channel for fleet management features. The founders' hands-on supply chain experience (shadowing facility staff, delivering to restaurants) is the right kind of domain immersion. And the first paying customer in June 2025 with $100k+ in purchasing volume processed shows something works. If I squint, there's a version of this where the ontology layer creates a genuine data moat across customers that makes each subsequent deployment faster and better -- a learning curve that compounds. But I'd need to see evidence that the ontology is actually generalizing across customers rather than being rebuilt bespoke each time, and the 80/20 customization ratio suggests it's closer to the latter.

The founding team has entrepreneurial hustle -- protein bars, marketing agencies, crypto projects, coding camps since age 12, spending life savings at 18 to fly across Australia for customer conversations. That's real. But neither founder has enterprise software experience, prior exits, or demonstrated ability to sell into the manufacturing procurement stack. Supply chain buyers at hardware companies are not easy customers. They're conservative, process-oriented, and vendor-switching-averse. Selling ERP-adjacent tooling requires navigating IT security reviews, procurement cycles, and integration testing that can stretch six months or more. I don't see evidence the team has thought about distribution beyond "book a demo" -- and founders who haven't considered distribution from day one tend to underestimate how hard enterprise go-to-market actually is.

I'm passing. The market is real but not non-obvious, the competitive landscape includes well-funded incumbents and direct competitors, the "why now" is generic across the entire AI application layer rather than specific to this team's approach, and the founding team -- while energetic -- lacks the enterprise software depth and distribution thinking that would give me conviction they can win in a crowded category. The single-miracle test fails here: the plan requires simultaneously solving ERP integration complexity, building reliable AI agents, and executing enterprise sales to conservative manufacturing buyers -- that's at least two miracles.
