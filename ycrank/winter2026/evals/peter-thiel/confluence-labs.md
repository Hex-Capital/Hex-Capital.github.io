# Confluence Labs -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing fact about Confluence Labs is not what they have built but what they have given away. Their primary public credential -- a 97.9% score on ARC-AGI-2, far surpassing the 37.6% achieved by the best commercial system in the ARC Prize 2025 competition -- is MIT-licensed and fully available on GitHub, where it has accumulated 73 stars. This is the anti-Palantir pattern. When we built Palantir, we spent seven years developing proprietary data-fusion technology before the market could comprehend what we were doing, let alone replicate it. The technology *was* the moat. Confluence Labs has published its methodology on day one, inviting the world to reproduce it. You cannot build a monopoly by open-sourcing your primary differentiator. This is a research contribution, not a company strategy.

The deeper problem is the absence of a secret. What does Confluence Labs believe about the world that most intelligent people actively disagree with? Their thesis -- that AI can help scientists design better experiments in data-sparse domains -- is not contrarian. It is consensus. Every major AI lab, every pharmaceutical R&D department, and every materials science group in the world agrees that data efficiency matters and that AI can accelerate scientific discovery. The investment landscape confirms this: Lila Sciences raised a $200 million seed round, Periodic Labs raised $300 million, CuspAI raised $100 million, and Poetiq raised $45.8 million -- all pursuing AI for scientific reasoning and discovery. When a thesis attracts this much capital from this many directions simultaneously, it has ceased to be a secret and become a convention. The entire "AI for science" category is experiencing the mimetic convergence that destroys value: dozens of well-funded teams imitating each other's positioning, competing for the same pharmaceutical and materials science customers, and ensuring that no single player achieves the structural dominance that produces venture-scale returns.

Confluence Labs compounds this competitive exposure with indefinite thinking. Their website solicits "collaborators" in hardware engineering, biology, materials science, and physics. They have no product, no paying customers, no pilot deployments, no pricing, and no specific plan for which domain to enter first. "Domain-agnostic" is not a strategy -- it is the absence of one. The founders have demonstrated that they can solve synthetic grid puzzles at remarkable accuracy, but the gap between ARC-AGI-2's abstract pattern recognition and designing drug discovery experiments for a pharmaceutical R&D team is not a gap that benchmark performance bridges. This is a team searching for a problem, not a team executing on a vision. The lean-startup pathology is evident: they have a capability and are looking for applications, rather than starting from a definite conviction about how the world should work and building backward from that future.

The strongest bull case requires imagining that these founders -- a self-taught engineer who has built MVPs for other people's startups and a current college student with a competitive mathematics and research background -- possess the kind of raw intellectual horsepower that eventually converges on a genuine secret. Baskaran's RSI selection, ISEF awards, and research at Vassar suggest real cognitive ability. The ARC-AGI-2 result, regardless of its commercial relevance, demonstrates an unusual capacity for structured reasoning about reasoning itself. If these founders spent the next year embedded in a single domain -- say, materials science for battery chemistry -- and discovered a specific, non-obvious application where their approach produced 10x improvements in experiment design efficiency, they could potentially carve out a defensible niche. But that path requires them to abandon their current "domain-agnostic" positioning, pick a fight they can win in a small arena, and build proprietary data assets through customer engagements that competitors cannot easily replicate. Nothing in their current trajectory suggests this is the plan.

The monopoly arithmetic simply does not work here. They have none of the four monopoly characteristics: no proprietary technology (open-sourced), no network effects (no users), no economies of scale (no product), and negative branding (name collision with Atlassian's Confluence, which dominates every search result). They are entering multiple large markets simultaneously rather than monopolizing a specific niche. They are competing against teams with 50-600x their funding in adjacent spaces. They have demonstrated technical skill without commercial direction. The power law demands that I invest only in companies that could return the entire fund, and a domain-agnostic AI research lab with no product, no customers, and no monopoly mechanism in a consensus investment category does not clear that threshold. This is a team with talent searching for a secret they have not yet found.
