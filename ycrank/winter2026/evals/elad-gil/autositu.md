# AutoSitu -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Eight major U.S. cities listed as clients on the website of a two-person pre-seed startup selling into government procurement. San José, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Long Beach, Honolulu. That's the fact that stops me. Government agencies don't evaluate software they don't need. Procurement conversations at this scale don't happen because a startup asked nicely -- they happen because there's genuine pull from an institutional pain point that has reached a threshold. Whether these represent paid contracts, pilots, or structured evaluations is ambiguous, and that ambiguity matters. But even at the weakest interpretation, getting eight major municipalities to engage with your product as a two-person team in a market with notoriously long sales cycles is an execution signal that demands attention.

The structural moment here is specific and multi-layered, which is exactly what I look for. Three things converged in 2023-2025: multimodal AI models crossed the capability threshold to parse architectural drawings and cross-reference against regulatory text -- a task that was genuinely not feasible with prior-generation computer vision. The U.S. housing shortage created unusual political urgency to accelerate permitting -- California's Governor announced a dedicated AI tool for building permits in April 2025, which signals institutional readiness far beyond the norm for government technology adoption. And post-COVID municipal staff shortages left planning departments structurally understaffed, creating demand for augmentation tools rather than replacement tools. This isn't "AI exists therefore GovTech." This is a specific capability threshold crossing at the exact moment political will and institutional capacity gaps align. The market appears boring -- municipal plan review is about as unglamorous as it gets -- and the TAM looks modest at $1.25 billion for permit management software. But that figure dramatically undersizes the real addressable value. The cost of a 3-9 month permitting delay to a real estate developer holding land, paying interest, and deferring revenue runs into millions per project. AutoSitu isn't selling software -- it's selling velocity in a process where delay is the single most expensive variable. When I see a market that looks small from the supply side but enormous from the demand side, that's the gap between how a market looks today and where the adoption curve is actually heading.

What I notice that most investors would miss: the jurisdictional fragmentation that appears to be AutoSitu's biggest scaling challenge is actually its deepest moat. Every U.S. municipality operates under unique zoning codes, building codes, fire codes, and review procedures. Each city AutoSitu onboards generates jurisdiction-specific training data and precedent patterns that a new entrant would need years to replicate. This is the same dynamic I've seen in companies like Anduril, where ITAR compliance and security clearances create multi-year barriers, or Coinbase, where financial regulation built a structural moat for early movers. The Code & Precedent Graph they're building is a compounding data asset -- boring to describe, extremely difficult to replicate. Most software-focused investors hear "government" and "fragmentation" and pass. I hear it and think about switching costs and data moats.

The positioning choice to embed on the municipal reviewer side rather than the applicant side is strategically sharp. PermitFlow has $90.5M and owns the developer-facing workflow. AutoSitu sits where the bottleneck actually lives -- the review desk. If you become the infrastructure layer for how cities evaluate plans, you eventually become the authoritative channel for developers and architects to pre-check submissions before they submit. That's a product-to-distribution trajectory: from municipal copilot to the compliance layer that both sides of the permitting process flow through. The founders haven't publicly articulated this multi-product vision, and I'd want to hear them describe it. But the structural path exists regardless of whether they've named it yet. PermitFlow is a real competitive concern given its funding, but expanding from applicant-side workflow management into AI-driven code compliance review on the municipal side is a different product and a different sales motion -- it's not a natural extension of what they've built.

The single miracle here is clear: can multimodal AI achieve sufficient accuracy on architectural plan review that municipal staff trust it to meaningfully reduce their workload? The claimed 50-70% reduction in city comments suggests they believe they're approaching this threshold. The human-in-the-loop design shows they understand that "good enough with human review" -- not perfection -- is the value proposition, which is the same insight that made legal AI viable. The miracle is also partially being delivered by the foundation model labs, not by AutoSitu alone: as GPT, Claude, and Gemini vision capabilities improve, AutoSitu's accuracy improves alongside. This is the Harvey pattern -- build the workflow and domain knowledge layer while the underlying models get better on someone else's R&D budget. The founder pairing maps directly to the dual challenge: Lin brings Harvard GSD urban planning expertise and hands-on experience with municipal planning processes, Zhai brings Georgia Tech AI and robotics engineering. Neither has a prior exit, which is a gap, but the domain depth is genuine rather than acquired. First-time founders with deep domain expertise attacking a structurally ready market is a bet I've made before.

The risk that deserves honest engagement: government sales cycles can kill a two-person startup. Being spread across eight cities simultaneously could mean none of them convert to paid contracts before the runway runs out. And PermitFlow's $90.5M gives them the resources to expand into AutoSitu's territory if they choose to. These are real risks. But they're execution risks, not structural ones -- the kind that determine whether this specific team wins, not whether the market opportunity exists. The market opportunity is clear, the timing is right, and the regulatory complexity creates the kind of moat I've consistently invested behind.
