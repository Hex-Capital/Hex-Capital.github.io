# Jinba -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is the platonic ideal of a company I pass on. When I wrote that the SaaS era is over and software is a business tool, not a business model, I was describing a structural shift -- not making a prediction. Jinba is building an AI-powered workflow automation SaaS. That sentence contains three things I'm allergic to: the product IS AI, the model IS subscription software, and the category IS workflow automation -- the single most crowded space in enterprise software right now. Zapier, Workato, n8n, Tray.io, Microsoft Power Automate, and roughly fifty YC companies across the last four batches are all converging on the same thesis: use LLMs to let non-engineers build automations through natural language. This isn't an insane idea. This is the most consensus idea in enterprise tech. Every VC on Sand Hill Road nods enthusiastically at "AI workflow automation for the enterprise." That nod is exactly the signal that tells me the returns have been priced out.

The founders are clearly competent. Matsumori's PhD from Keio, his time at Preferred Networks -- which is genuinely Japan's best AI research lab -- and his prior founding experience make him credible. Norisugi's McKinsey-to-INSEAD-to-ML-engineer arc is the kind of resume that screams "this person can navigate enterprise sales." The "sane" half of my equation is satisfied. But sane people with a sane idea is the worst configuration for me as an investor. I need the idea to make other VCs recoil or scratch their heads. "Conversational workflow builder for financial institutions" makes every VC lean forward. That's the problem.

Let me run the kill test. Would Jinba be a good business if AI didn't exist? The answer is obviously no -- the entire product is AI-generated workflow logic from natural language. Without the LLM layer, you have a worse Zapier with fewer integrations. This isn't a painting company with a tech layer. This is a tech layer pretending to be a painting company. The "cherry on top" test fails completely. And the moat question is even worse: n8n raised $253 million and is already integrating AI-assisted workflow building. Workato launched "Genies" -- AI agents for enterprise functions -- in August 2025. Zapier has $310 million in revenue and 8,000+ connectors. What happens when these incumbents, who already own the integration libraries and customer relationships, ship the exact same natural-language interface? Jinba's conversational AI differentiation doesn't survive that collision. The core capability -- using an LLM to generate workflow logic from plain English -- is reproducible by any team with API access and a weekend.

The bull case, and I want to be honest about it: 40,000 enterprise users at major financial institutions is a genuinely arresting number if it's real. Financial services is the hardest vertical to crack because of compliance, procurement cycles, and institutional inertia. If Jinba has genuinely embedded itself in Japanese financial institutions' compliance-sensitive workflows with on-prem deployment, that creates meaningful switching costs. The Japan wedge is interesting -- regulated Japanese enterprises have data sovereignty requirements that Silicon Valley competitors underserve, and Matsumori and Norisugi have the cultural and professional networks to exploit that gap. If you squint, there's a version of this where Jinba becomes the default automation layer inside Asian financial institutions and the 40K users compound into something defensible through sheer organizational lock-in. But even in this optimistic scenario, you're looking at a strong regional enterprise software business, not an infinity story. The narrative ceiling is visible: you become a workflow tool vendor for regulated industries. That's a good business, not a venture-scale outcome that justifies the risk.

On the primitive-versus-application hierarchy, Jinba sits firmly at the application layer. They're building on other people's LLMs (AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Llama), other people's cloud infrastructure, and other people's integration APIs. They're not creating a new protocol, a new data standard, or a new layer that others compose on top of. Every one of my largest wins -- Venmo, Solana, Aleo, Helium -- was a new primitive that became infrastructure for an ecosystem. Jinba is an interface on top of existing infrastructure, which means their fate is determined by decisions made by the platforms beneath them. When OpenAI changes pricing or AWS Bedrock shifts capabilities, Jinba's unit economics move in ways they don't control. That's the opposite of the structural position I look for.

The subscription pricing model as primary business model innovation is another flag I can't ignore. Free, $39, $399, Enterprise custom. This is textbook SaaS tiering. I've been saying for two years that software companies that had moats are learning they aren't moats anymore, and here's a pre-seed company building a new SaaS product into the teeth of that structural headwind. The consumption-based elements (API credits, copilot requests) don't change the fundamental equation -- you're still selling software access, and every quarter the cost of replicating that software drops as models get cheaper and more capable.
