# Asimov -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Asimov is who else is already doing this. Scale AI -- a $29 billion company with $870 million in 2024 revenue -- launched its Physical AI data collection platform in 2025 and is already serving Physical Intelligence and Generalist AI. Cortex AI, another YC company one batch ahead, runs a similar workplace data marketplace. Sensei, yet another YC company, tackles the same data bottleneck from a different hardware angle. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's own CTO told me TCP/IP routing in public telecom would never happen. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry thought plant-based meat was a joke. My highest-conviction investments are in spaces where the experts and incumbents dismiss the approach. Here, the incumbents are racing to do exactly what Asimov is doing. That is the opposite signal.

The consequence-of-success question is where this gets complicated. The underlying problem is genuinely important: humanoid robots cannot scale without internet-scale training data, and that data doesn't exist yet. Language models had the internet. Vision models had billions of images. Robotics has nothing equivalent. If Asimov becomes the foundational data layer for every humanoid robot on Earth, that matters. But I need to be precise about what "success" actually means here. Success means becoming a data marketplace supplier to robotics labs -- a valuable business, potentially a multi-billion dollar one, but not one that transforms how any industry operates. Scale AI is worth $29 billion as a data supplier, so the ceiling isn't trivial. But the consequence is "we feed an input into someone else's revolution." The robotics labs building the humanoid robots are the ones changing how factories, households, and hospitals work. Asimov makes their job easier. That's a real business. It's not the kind of consequence magnitude that makes me ignore probability of failure.

The technology disruption dimension is where this falls short of my framework most sharply. A lightweight headband camera distributed to paid contributors is not a technology breakthrough. The dossier itself states the hardware "does not appear to involve proprietary technology that is difficult to replicate." The annotation pipeline -- 3D body pose, depth maps, semantic labels -- is competent engineering, not structural disruption. Nothing about this approach makes the existing way of collecting robotics training data economically obsolete. It offers a different collection method: distributed and organic versus lab-controlled and scripted. That's a product differentiation, not a technology moat. When I evaluate disruption potential, I ask: at scale, does this make the incumbent approach unviable? A $29 billion incumbent with established enterprise relationships, massive contractor networks, and the resources to subsidize pricing doesn't become unviable because someone distributes headband cameras. This is closer to the incremental innovation I avoid -- a process improvement within an existing paradigm -- than the structural disruption that excites me.

The strongest bull case deserves a full hearing. The timing is genuinely exceptional. Robotics investment hit $7.2 billion in 2025. Figure AI reached $39 billion. China is building government-funded training centers because the data shortage is that acute. The data bottleneck is the binding constraint on the entire humanoid robotics revolution, and whoever solves it captures enormous value. Asimov's 5,000+ contributors across 3 continents represent a real head start in building data diversity -- different homes, kitchens, cultural contexts, body types -- that takes time to replicate even with Scale AI's resources. If data diversity proves to be the key differentiator (and not just data volume, where Scale wins easily), then the distributed contributor network could develop genuine network effects. The contributor learns the system, the data quality improves with experience, and the switching costs compound. If I squint, I can see a scenario where Asimov's organic, diverse, real-world data proves categorically more valuable for robot training than Scale's contractor-scripted lab data -- and that quality difference becomes a moat. For this to work, the technology would need to evolve from "headband cameras" to something with deeper proprietary processing that makes the raw data uniquely useful. I don't see evidence of that trajectory yet, but the founder is young and the company is pre-seed.

On the founder -- Lyem Ningthou is a recent Berkeley CS grad with defense tech robotics research experience, NSF-funded GPU hours, and prior work at multiple startups including a YC company. There's entrepreneurial drive visible from an early age. But I evaluate founders on learning rate, first-principles thinking, and contrarian courage. Building a data collection marketplace for an obviously data-starved industry isn't contrarian -- it's consensus. I don't see evidence of the kind of thinking that makes experts uncomfortable. The approach is sensible, executable, and exactly what you'd design if you did a market analysis of robotics data gaps. That's fine for most investors. For me, it signals the founder has optimized for reducing failure probability rather than maximizing the consequence of success. A version of this company that excites me would be attempting something the robotics data experts say can't work -- synthetic data generation that eliminates the need for human collection entirely, or a radically new sensor modality that captures physical interaction data no camera can see. Something where the response from Scale AI's team would be "that'll never work."

I respect the execution. Five thousand contributors across three continents is real operational achievement for a team of three at pre-seed. The timing alignment with the robotics investment surge is excellent. But this is a data services business entering a market where the dominant data services company has already arrived with thirty times the resources. The technology doesn't create structural disruption. The consequence of success is a good company in a competitive market, not an industry transformation. I pass.
