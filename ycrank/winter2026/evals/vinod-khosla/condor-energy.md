# Condor Energy -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company in the energy space — a space where I've personally lost $160 million on KiOR, where I've backed fusion reactors and solid-state batteries and orbital launch vehicles — and their pitch is that they'll help large companies save "up to 20%" on their electricity bills. I stop right there. If Condor succeeds beyond anyone's wildest expectations, the consequence is that procurement teams at European retail chains and data centers negotiate better power contracts. The electricity grid operates identically. The same fossil plants run. The same renewables intermittency persists. The same fundamental energy architecture remains intact. The world is not meaningfully different. This is the definition of a consequence of success that is inconsequential relative to the effort.

I've spent more than two decades in energy because the problem demands transformation — not optimization of existing purchasing workflows. Commonwealth Fusion Systems exists because fusion energy would make fossil fuels structurally obsolete. QuantumScape exists because a solid-state battery would redefine what electric vehicles can do. Condor Energy exists because spreadsheets are annoying. The dossier itself concedes the point: "The individual components — energy dashboards, price forecasting, hedging analytics — are not technically unique." And the commoditization risk is described as "material." When the company's own factual assessment acknowledges there's no technology moat, you're looking at an integration play in a market where Voltus has $121 million, Pexapark has $41 million, and Schneider Electric has a century-long head start. The competition didn't dismiss this approach as impossible — they're already doing variants of it. That's a red flag in my framework, not validation.

The founding team has exactly the profile I find least compelling for a transformational bet. A former power trader, two hydropower operations engineers — all industry insiders executing the industry's playbook. They conducted "200+ interviews" to understand what large electricity buyers want, and they built the tool those buyers described. That's good product management. It's the opposite of what created Juniper, Impossible Foods, or OpenAI. Pradeep Sindhu didn't interview Cisco's customers to figure out what incremental router improvements they wanted — he reimagined network architecture from first principles at Xerox PARC. Pat Brown didn't survey food executives — he asked whether you could build a hamburger from molecules. Condor's founders know the energy procurement business intimately, which means they know precisely what's considered feasible and have built accordingly. No evidence of contrarian thinking, no willingness to attempt what experts consider impossible, no outsider audacity.

The strongest bull case would require me to believe that Condor's data aggregation across hundreds of large consumers eventually creates a fundamentally new market structure — essentially evolving from an analytics platform into a buying cooperative or energy marketplace that shifts how power is transacted at scale. If every large C&I buyer in Europe and the US ran procurement through Condor, the company would hold enormous purchasing leverage and could potentially disintermediate energy brokers entirely, creating network effects that make the platform indispensable. The data center growth trajectory adds urgency — AI infrastructure is creating a new category of massive electricity consumers who need procurement tools immediately. The timing is genuinely favorable: post-2022 energy crisis awareness, increasing renewable intermittency, regulatory complexity around hourly matching. And the team's domain expertise — particularly Florian's trading background — maps directly to the product's core capability. If I squint, this could become a platform that reshapes energy markets rather than just optimizing within them. But the current ambition, as stated, doesn't reach for that outcome. "Cut electricity bills by up to 20%" is a consulting pitch, not a vision for restructuring trillion-dollar energy markets.

The timing is the one dimension where Condor has a legitimate argument, but it's consensus timing. Everyone knows energy markets are getting more volatile and complex. The data center buildout is front-page news. There's no "skating to where the puck will be" here — this is skating to where the puck already is, alongside a dozen well-funded competitors. When I invested in cleantech in 2004 or AI in 2019, I was early enough that the investment itself was considered foolish. Nobody looks at energy procurement software in 2026 and thinks it's crazy. And when nobody thinks your investment is crazy, you're probably too late for the kind of returns I need.

This team is too smart and too well-positioned in energy to spend their careers making procurement 20% cheaper. The problem they should be working on is how to make the energy system itself fundamentally different — and they have the domain knowledge to do it. But as currently constructed, Condor has reduced its probability of failure to the point where I can't get excited about what success looks like.
