# ZeroSettle -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about ZeroSettle is not the founders or the technology -- it's that the "why now" is a starting gun everyone heard simultaneously. The Epic v. Apple injunction in April 2025 and the EU Digital Markets Act didn't whisper an opportunity to a few informed insiders. They broadcast it to every payments company on Earth. Paddle and RevenueCat announced their joint solution within weeks. Appcharge has raised $89M+ and processes half a billion in annual DTC transactions. Stripe published iOS external payment documentation. When the contrarian signal is a federal court ruling covered by every tech publication, the asymmetric upside has already been competed away. You get paid for being right first -- not for being right at the same time as Paddle's $1.4 billion war chest.

The founders' specific knowledge is real but misaligned with the hard problem. Both Ryan Elliott and Gabe Roeloffs are ex-Apple systems engineers -- Elliott on battery life and thermals, Roeloffs on operating systems. They understand Apple platform internals, StoreKit behavior, and how Apple thinks about compliance. That knowledge is directly useful for building a reliable, compliant SDK. But the SDK isn't the hard part. Any competent iOS team can build a drop-in payment SDK. The hard part -- the part that actually creates the defensible MoR business -- is tax compliance across 190+ countries, chargeback management, fraud detection, and navigating jurisdiction-specific regulatory regimes. That's deep fintech and payments operations knowledge. There's no evidence either founder has it. Their specific knowledge maps to maybe 20% of the problem surface. Paddle has been operating as a Merchant of Record for years. That operational knowledge compounds daily -- every edge case resolved, every jurisdiction navigated, every fraud pattern detected. ZeroSettle is starting from zero on the dimension that matters most.

The leverage test is where this falls apart for me. ZeroSettle doesn't create a new form of leverage -- it reduces an existing cost. When Replit makes programming accessible to someone who never would have coded, that's new leverage. When AngelList lets any accredited investor build a portfolio without a fund structure, that's new leverage. ZeroSettle lets developers who already sell subscriptions keep 25% more of their revenue. That's valuable, but it's arithmetic, not leverage. The output per unit of input doesn't change categories. The developer still builds the same app, sells to the same users, delivers the same value. The only difference is the split between Apple and the developer. Cost arbitrage driven by regulatory change is a fine business. It's not the kind of compounding, leverage-creating opportunity I look for.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If I'm wrong, here's why: the operational complexity of multi-jurisdiction MoR is genuinely high, and most indie developers will never build it themselves. If ZeroSettle becomes the default "easy button" before Paddle's two-vendor integration gains traction, the single-SDK simplicity could win the long tail of smaller developers -- the ones who can't negotiate custom Paddle deals. The founders' Apple background means they understand how Apple iterates on compliance rules, giving them an edge in keeping the SDK functional as Apple inevitably tries to reassert control. And the transaction-based revenue model means that if they capture even 2-3% of the iOS subscription market flowing through alternative billing, the recurring revenue base would be substantial. The Founding Partner Program -- free for two years -- is a smart land-and-expand approach that could build switching costs before competitors reach these developers. If Apple's commission on external links stays at zero (US) or below 10% (EU), and if ZeroSettle executes flawlessly on the payments operations side, this could be a solid mid-size outcome.

But "solid mid-size outcome" is the ceiling, not the floor. The company is structurally dependent on a single platform's regulatory posture. In December 2025, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Apple should be able to charge a "reasonable commission" on external purchases. If that commission lands at 15-20%, ZeroSettle's value proposition narrows to near-zero after accounting for its own 5% take. The company's existence depends on the continued goodwill of courts toward developers and the continued hostility of regulators toward Apple -- forces entirely outside the founders' control. I don't invest in regulatory arbitrage. I invest in technology that compounds. The crypto/escrow component flagged in their GitHub repos adds positioning confusion without clear strategic logic. The technology here doesn't get harder to replicate over time -- it gets easier, as Paddle, Stripe, and others build out their own iOS payment solutions with vastly more resources.

Two ex-Apple engineers building for the Apple ecosystem is founder-market fit in the narrow sense. But the problem they're solving is a payments infrastructure problem dressed up as an iOS problem. The specific knowledge they possess and the specific knowledge required are different domains. This is a consensus bet, in a crowded market, dependent on regulatory outcomes, competing against billion-dollar incumbents, creating cost reduction rather than new leverage. I'd pass.
