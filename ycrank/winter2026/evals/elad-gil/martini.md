# Martini -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Martini is where it sits in the value chain -- and it's the most exposed position possible. The company is an orchestration layer between commodity inputs (third-party AI video models accessible via API) and commodity outputs (video files). It doesn't train models, doesn't own proprietary data, and doesn't control the infrastructure it depends on. When I mapped AI market structure in my "AI Market Clarity" framework, I specifically tracked which layers capture durable value versus which layers get squeezed. Orchestration layers that don't compound -- that don't build proprietary assets with each transaction -- tend to get absorbed by the platforms above or below them. Runway has $860M in funding and is targeting $300M in annualized revenue. Luma AI has raised over $1B. These companies have every incentive and every resource to build professional workflow features directly into their model interfaces. The moment Runway ships collaboration and timeline editing in their native UI, Martini's multi-model routing becomes its only differentiation -- and multi-model routing is a weekend project for a competent engineering team.

The structural moment here is real but mischaracterized. Yes, multiple AI video models reached commercial quality simultaneously in 2024-2025, creating a multi-model ecosystem for the first time. That's a genuine inflection. But this is a consensus-hot market, not a non-obvious one. When I invested in PagerDuty, nobody was excited about operations alerting. When I backed Gusto, payroll sounded like a punchline. Those markets triggered dismissive reactions from other investors, which is exactly why the returns were asymmetric. AI video generation triggers the opposite reaction -- everyone sees it, everyone's funding it, and billions have already poured in. A "too boring" market with hidden scale is the archetype I hunt for. A market where Runway alone has raised nearly a billion dollars is not that.

The "Figma for generative film" comparison deserves scrutiny because it reveals more problems than opportunities. Figma succeeded for three specific reasons: browser-based design was a 10x improvement over Sketch/Adobe desktop tools, design collaboration had genuine network effects because designers needed real-time feedback from engineers and PMs, and no dominant player had nailed collaborative design. Martini's situation differs on all three axes. The orchestration layer isn't a 10x improvement over using individual model UIs -- it's a convenience aggregator. Film production collaboration is real but happens primarily in editing suites (Premiere, Resolve), not in the generation step. And the dominant players here are the model companies themselves, who are building interfaces while also controlling the underlying capability. More importantly, Figma's distribution trajectory was clear from early on -- a collaborative design tool naturally expanded into FigJam, developer handoff, and design systems because the user relationship was deep and persistent. What's Martini's second product? More workflow features? That's incremental, not platform expansion. I don't see how the initial product becomes a distribution channel that compounds.

The bull case rests on founder-market fit, and it's genuine. Koh Terai is a Cannes-screened cinematographer with a CS degree from NYU Abu Dhabi and a Stanford design MS -- the rare combination of someone who actually understands professional film production AND can build software. If anyone can design cinematography controls that professionals will adopt, it's someone who has operated a camera on set. The 200+ films created on the platform, with some airing as TV commercials, is meaningful pre-seed traction. And the NLE export integration (Premiere/Resolve XML) shows the team is thinking about fitting into existing professional workflows rather than replacing them. If the multi-model ecosystem persists -- if AI video generation follows the cloud provider pattern (AWS/GCP/Azure coexisting) rather than the search pattern (Google winning 90%+) -- then the orchestration layer could become the professional standard. But that's a bet on market structure remaining fragmented, which is itself a miracle. Combined with the miracle of professional filmmakers adopting AI workflows at scale, and the miracle of capturing the orchestration value before Runway or Adobe build it natively, this is a three-miracle plan. I pass on companies that require compounding low-probability events, regardless of how talented the founders are.

The technology cycle timing is reasonable -- the team is building at the right moment when models can generate commercially usable video but professional workflows haven't solidified. That window matters. But being correctly timed in a consensus market with massively capitalized competitors is insufficient. When I backed Harvey, the legal AI market looked impossible to most investors -- that asymmetry was core to the opportunity. Here, everyone already agrees AI video production is going to be enormous. The question isn't whether the market exists; it's whether a two-person pre-seed company building a workflow wrapper can capture durable value against companies with 100-400x more capital. The answer depends on whether "cinematography-native UX" constitutes a genuine software-driven moat or whether it's a feature set that Runway ships in a quarter. My read: it's a feature, not a moat.
