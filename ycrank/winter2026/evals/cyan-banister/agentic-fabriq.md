# Agentic Fabriq -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what hits me immediately about Agentic Fabriq: this is one of the most crowded spaces I've seen in years. Over $200 million in dedicated startup funding has already poured into non-human identity and agent security -- Oasis at $75 million, Astrix at $85 million, SGNL acquired by CrowdStrike for $740 million -- and Okta shipped Auth for GenAI in October 2025 targeting this exact buyer persona. When I look at my best investments, the defining characteristic was that nobody else wanted to be there. SpaceX in private space, Crusoe turning waste gas into computation, Contraline in male contraception -- these were spaces where I was often the only investor willing to write a check. "Okta for Agents" is the opposite of that. It's a category where consensus has already formed, the big players are already building, and the hot money is already deployed. When every VC in town understands the opportunity and has already funded their horse, the weirdness has been priced out of the deal.

The founders are where I always start, and what I find here is two clearly intelligent people -- Paulina and Matthew Xu, both MIT AI/ML researchers who dropped out before their second year to start this company. They've done serious work at CSAIL, the Kavli Institute, Haystack Observatory. I don't doubt their technical ability. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "tell me their story, not the business" -- I don't hear a biographical thread that connects them to enterprise identity and access management. There's no story of watching an AI agent wreak havoc because of broken permissions. No years spent inside enterprise security watching the problem grow. No personal frustration that makes this their life's work rather than a well-timed market opportunity. Dropping out of MIT to do a YC startup in the hottest AI sub-category isn't the kind of grit I'm calibrated to recognize -- it's increasingly the default path for ambitious technical founders, which is fine, but it doesn't give me the signal I need. The founders who persist through the kind of competitive onslaught they're about to face are usually the ones for whom failure isn't an option because the problem is personal.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. Enterprise agent adoption is genuinely exploding -- from under 5% to potentially 40% of enterprise applications featuring embedded agents within about a year. That's a real inflection point, and I've made some of my best infrastructure bets at inflection points like this. The specific framing of employee-scoped agent permissions is somewhat differentiated from broader NHI security; Oasis and Astrix are managing machine identities broadly, while Agentic Fabriq is mapping agent permissions back to individual human clearance levels. If Okta's legacy SSO architecture truly can't adapt to agent-native permission models -- and there's a reasonable argument it can't, given how deeply their data model is oriented around human-to-app flows -- then there is a real opening for a purpose-built control plane. A two-person team with $500K can iterate faster than a public company managing billions in existing revenue. If they can land two or three enterprise design partners quickly through YC's network and build the kind of switching costs that come from deeply embedded permission configurations, they might carve out a position before the window closes.

But that window is razor-thin, and I don't see evidence they've started closing it. No disclosed customers, no pilots, no revenue signals, no compliance certifications -- and for enterprise security buyers, SOC 2 and audit trails aren't nice-to-haves, they're table stakes. The technical surface area is enormous for two people: connectors to enterprise tools, a policy engine, per-user OAuth delegation, audit logging. Every connector is a maintenance burden as third-party APIs change. I've watched companies drown trying to be an integration platform with insufficient resources. And the competitive moat question is the one I always probe hardest -- "defensibility and your moat is one of the number one things we look for in the early stages." I see no moat here. The underlying technical components are well-understood building blocks. The employee-scoping insight is a framing difference, not a technical barrier. Any of the $75M+ funded competitors could add this view in a sprint.

One thing I do notice, and it's a pattern I tend to track: this product could make invisible permission structures visible to IT administrators. That resonates with something I've seen work in Carta making cap tables transparent, or Flock Safety surfacing public safety data. But the beneficiaries here are enterprise security teams who already have tools and budgets -- not underserved populations gaining access to something previously denied to them. This doesn't create economic opportunity for people who lack it. It's infrastructure for people who already have infrastructure.

On co-founder dynamics, Paulina and Matthew share a surname and met at MIT admit weekend. If they're family, that actually piques my interest -- I've expressed preference for family-run businesses with built-in conflict resolution. But even with that potential positive, I don't have enough information about how they navigate disagreement under pressure, and this company is about to face extraordinary pressure from every direction. The competitive landscape alone will test any relationship.

This is a pass for me. Smart founders in a real market, but it's a consensus bet in a flooded category with no biographical thread connecting the founders to this specific problem and no disclosed traction against competitors with hundred-million-dollar head starts. I invest my own money in the companies that look wrong to everyone else. This one looks right to everyone -- and that's exactly when the price is wrong and the odds are worst for the smallest check in the room.
