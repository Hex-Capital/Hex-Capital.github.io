# RoboDock -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Zinny Weli spent years building autonomous charging systems -- first for Zipline's drone fleet, then for Amazon's home robot. That's not someone who read a market report and decided depot automation sounded big. That's someone who was literally the person plugging robots into chargers, day after day, and eventually thought: this whole depot is broken, not just the plug. When I see that kind of origin story, I pay attention. The best startup ideas aren't conceived -- they accumulate. They build up in someone's mind over years of direct experience until the founder finally says "fine, I'll do it myself." Dropbox happened because Drew Houston kept forgetting his USB drive. RoboDock happened because Zinny kept building charging systems and seeing that the depot around them was still stuck in the manual age.

The schlep here is real and ugly. You're building physical robots that have to work across different charger types, different vehicle form factors, different depot layouts. You need computer vision, soft robotics, mechatronics, and the patience to deploy hardware one depot at a time. This is exactly the kind of problem that causes most founders to unconsciously look away. Software people see "depot operations" and think "someone else will handle the physical stuff." Hardware people see "fleet software" and think "someone else will handle the intelligence layer." RoboDock sits at the intersection, which is where schlep blindness is strongest -- not in any single domain, but in the integration between domains. The fact that both founders are hands-on engineers who've worked across this exact intersection (Zinny on charging infrastructure, Celine Wang on actuator and sensor integration for autonomous trucks at Plus) means the schlep doesn't scare them. They've been doing this schlep at other people's companies.

What gives me pause is Rocsys sitting at $44.6M raised with partnerships across IONITY, Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche. Yes, Rocsys focuses on the robotic charging connector rather than full depot automation, and yes, their OEM partnerships are with consumer car companies rather than AV fleet operators. Those are genuinely different markets. But the technical overlap is significant -- vision-guided plug insertion is the core capability in both cases, and a company with $44.6M and automotive OEM relationships can expand its scope faster than a two-person pre-seed team can build from scratch. RoboDock's differentiation -- the broader "depot automation platform" including inspections and learning -- is the right strategic answer, but it's still a PowerPoint distinction until they've built it and deployed it at a real depot.

The bull case is genuinely interesting. If you believe AV fleets will scale to hundreds of vehicles per depot within a few years (and Waymo is already there), then manual depot operations become a binding constraint on fleet economics. The $900K per depot in annual charging labor costs cited on their YC page, if accurate, means a single depot automation installation pays for itself quickly. Rocsys's consumer EV focus means no one is specifically building for the AV fleet depot problem at scale. And the founders aren't just adjacent to this problem -- they're from the exact companies (Zipline, Amazon robotics, Plus autonomous trucks) that represent the customer base. Zinny could probably walk into Waymo's depot operations team and speak their language fluently. If the timing is right and AV fleets are genuinely ready to buy depot automation, this team is perfectly positioned. That's a real scenario, not a hypothetical one.

But I have no evidence anyone is buying yet. No customers, no LOIs, no revenue, no confirmed prototype deployment. The website shows modeled metrics -- "$1.2M+ recovered per depot annually" -- that are projections, not results. At pre-seed I don't penalize for thin traction, but I do note its complete absence. The near-term addressable customer base is also narrow: maybe five to ten AV fleet operators with depot-scale needs today. If AV deployment timelines slip again (and they have, repeatedly), this market could stay small for longer than a startup's runway allows. Hardware businesses don't have the luxury of pivoting cheaply -- you can't iterate on physical robots the way you iterate on software.

The technical founder signal is strong. Two engineers with Stanford robotics credentials, one who designed charging systems at Zipline and Amazon, another who integrated actuators and sensors for autonomous trucks. These are people who build things with their hands, not people who manage contractors. That matters enormously at this stage. But I'd want to see evidence of a working prototype before writing a check -- even a rough one. The transition from "we have the skills to build this" to "we have built this and it works in a real depot" is where hardware startups either prove themselves or stall.
