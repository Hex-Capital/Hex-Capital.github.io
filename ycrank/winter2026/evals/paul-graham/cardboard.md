# Cardboard -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Cardboard is the category. "AI video editor" in early 2026 is one of those ideas that every smart technical person has considered, which is precisely what makes it suspicious. Runway has raised $860 million. Descript has $55 million in ARR. OpusClip has $50 million in funding. When I said the most impressive YC companies I'd seen recently weren't working on AI, this is the dynamic I was pointing at -- categories where every investor is already excited have been priced accordingly. The question is whether Cardboard has found something inside this crowded space that others have unconsciously avoided. And the answer is: partially.

The compound engineering bet is where it gets interesting. Most AI video startups take the easy route -- bolt a language model onto an existing editor, or build a narrow tool that does one thing (OpusClip does long-to-short, Runway does generation). Almost nobody wants to build a full browser-native NLE from scratch using WebGPU and WebCodecs while simultaneously building a reliable agentic editing layer on top. That's two hard problems at once, and most teams pick one. The browser NLE alone is months of gnarly rendering pipeline work that has nothing to do with AI -- the kind of plumbing that smart engineers instinctively avoid because it's tedious and unglamorous. That's a real schlep. But it's an engineering schlep, not the regulatory-logistical schlep that creates permanent moats. Adobe could eventually ship browser tools. Kapwing could add agentic capabilities. The window exists but it isn't structural in the way Stripe's banking relationships were.

What I can't find in the dossier is the organic origin story I look for. How did these founders stumble into video editing as their obsession? Ishan made internal launch videos at HackerRank. Saksham creates content with 250K monthly views. Those are threads of experience, but they're not the kind of deep personal frustration that makes someone build a product because they can't not build it. Drew Houston kept forgetting his USB drive -- the problem was inescapable in his daily life. Here, the connection feels more like "we're capable engineers who identified a market gap" than "this problem has been haunting us for years." That distinction matters because the next three years of this company will be brutally competitive, and founders driven by organic necessity tend to outlast founders driven by opportunity analysis.

The bull case deserves serious consideration. Ishan is a genuine hacker -- building Hotspoter at age 12 with 5.7 million downloads is the kind of early signal I take seriously. That's not a school project; that's someone who ships things that real people use. His 4.5 years of browser performance engineering at HackerRank is directly applicable to the WebGPU/WebCodecs challenge. Saksham complements this with growth instincts and AI research credentials. The 15-year friendship between the co-founders is one of the strongest relationship signals I'd see at pre-seed -- I've watched enough co-founder relationships implode to know that this matters enormously. And 1K+ users with named customers including PostHog suggests the product works well enough that real teams are using it. If the agentic editing layer reaches the quality threshold where marketing teams genuinely trust it for production work, the combination of browser-native access and AI-first architecture could compound into something the incumbents can't easily replicate. The "why now" argument about WebGPU maturity plus multimodal LLM capabilities is technically sound, not hand-waving.

But the foundation model dependency concerns me. When your core product intelligence runs on someone else's API -- Claude Sonnet, in this case -- your margins, reliability, and differentiation are all downstream of decisions made at Anthropic. Pricing changes, capability shifts, rate limits -- any of these could disrupt the product overnight. This isn't like building on AWS, where the infrastructure is commoditized. The agentic orchestration layer is Cardboard's key differentiator, but it sits on top of capabilities that every competitor can also access. The moat, if one develops, will have to come from the quality of their orchestration logic and the data flywheel of editing patterns -- and that kind of advantage takes time to build while facing competitors with hundreds of millions in capital.

I'd describe these founders as capable and technically strong, working on a real problem, in a category that's too hot for comfort. The schlep of the compound bet is genuine but the organic backstory is thin. If they'd shown me evidence that marketing teams were pulling this product out of their hands -- canceling Descript subscriptions, telling colleagues unprompted -- I'd weight the technical execution more heavily. At 1K+ users with 7 named customers, there's a seed of pull but not enough to override the category concern. This is a competent team executing in a competitive space, which puts it solidly in the range where the outcome depends entirely on whether the agentic layer reaches a quality threshold before the incumbents catch up. That's a bet, but it's not the kind of bet where the founder-problem fit gives me conviction independent of execution risk.
