# Overdrive Health -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Overdrive Health: this is one of the most consensus categories in healthcare tech right now. AI medical billing has $95 million going to CodaMetrix alone, $350 million to Cedar, $41.5 million to Sift Healthcare. Market research firms are publishing TAM projections. Every healthcare-focused VC I know is looking at this space. And that's the fundamental problem for me -- I've learned over decades of investing that when everybody agrees something is a big opportunity, the price discovery has already happened and the weirdness has been arbitraged away. The most promising companies are not popular. Overdrive Health is entering the most popular category in health tech. There's no contrarian insight here that I can identify, no angle that makes other investors uncomfortable, nothing that would get rejected fifty times before someone with vision says yes. When I invested in Contraline, people thought male contraceptive gel was bizarre. When I wrote my first check to SpaceX, people thought Elon was out of his mind. AI medical billing? That's on every healthcare accelerator's wish list.

The founders' story doesn't give me what I need either. Daniel Inge and Michael Schroeder are clearly capable -- Harvard CS, Jane Street trading systems, Duke, EliseAI experience building AI agents in healthcare. That's an impressive resume. But when I say "tell me your story, not the business," I'm listening for the biographical thread that makes this founder inseparable from this problem. I want to hear about the family member who was bankrupted by billing errors, or the years spent inside a medical practice watching revenue bleed through coding mistakes, or some deeply personal encounter with the dysfunction they're trying to fix. What I see instead are two smart engineers from elite institutions who identified a market gap through professional experience at a healthcare AI company. That's rational, and it's fine -- but it doesn't tell me they'll fight through the inevitable crisis moments that destroy most startups. My conviction comes from biographical resilience, not credential accumulation.

The strongest case for Overdrive is the structural wedge they're targeting. Traditional billing outsourcers face real business model cannibalization if they adopt AI -- their revenue depends on headcount. EHR vendors like Epic are building AI features into their platforms, but they're software companies and building a fully managed billing service would require operational infrastructure that conflicts with their business model. That gap -- between software platforms that won't offer services and service companies that can't adopt AI -- is real, and the founders' experience at EliseAI, which sells AI automation into fragmented, operationally complex verticals, gives them a transferable playbook. There's also a genuine economic access dimension: if Overdrive can deliver high-quality billing at a fraction of the cost, smaller practices that currently lose revenue to coding errors and slow claims processing could capture more of what they're owed. That matters to real people -- physicians who are struggling to keep practices open, staff who are overwhelmed. I care about companies that create economic access, and better medical billing for underserved practices does qualify, even if it's incremental rather than transformative.

But I keep coming back to defensibility and the commoditization question. The dossier itself acknowledges it: "The core components (coding AI, eligibility verification APIs, claim submission) are becoming increasingly available through off-the-shelf tools and APIs." Large language models are lowering the barrier to entry every quarter. If the technical moat is narrow and the market is crowded, what you need is either a data flywheel that compounds over time or a founder with the irrational persistence to outrun better-funded competitors through sheer force of will. I don't see evidence of either yet. No public traction, no customer references, no revenue signal. The co-founder relationship has a positive indicator -- they worked together at EliseAI before starting this -- and I've learned from HQ Trivia how much that matters. But the discrepancy between the YC page listing a team size of one and LinkedIn showing two co-founders introduces a small note of uncertainty about the team composition that I'd want to understand.

This isn't a company I would dismiss -- the founders are technically capable, the market is real, and healthcare billing genuinely needs disruption. But it doesn't activate any of the signals I've trained myself to trust over 130-plus investments. There's no biographical urgency, no contrarian weirdness, no "jolt" of intuitive energy. It feels like a well-reasoned market entry by competent people, which in my experience produces moderate outcomes, not the outsized returns that justify the extraordinary risk of pre-seed investing with my own money.
