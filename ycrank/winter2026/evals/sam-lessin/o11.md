# o11 -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is a pass I can articulate in one sentence before I even get to the founders: o11 is an AI-powered SaaS product whose entire value proposition disappears if AI didn't exist, built as a third-party add-in on Microsoft's platform, in a market where Rogo has already raised $165 million at a $750 million valuation and Hebbia has $13 million in ARR. That's not a sane person with an insane idea -- that's a reasonable team sprinting into the most consensus market in enterprise AI. When I wrote that the pass case writes itself for "AI-powered versions of existing SaaS tools," I was describing companies exactly like this one. The pitch deck leads with TAM size ($114 billion enterprise AI market!), the competitive landscape is stuffed with well-capitalized incumbents, and the business model is a subscription pricing tier -- $20/month, $200/month. Every single one of my red flags is firing simultaneously.

Let me run the structural tests. Would this business be good if AI didn't exist? Obviously not -- without AI, o11 is literally nothing. It has no physical operations, no regulatory position, no protocol-layer lock-in. The product IS the AI, which means it's a feature waiting to be absorbed. Microsoft Copilot is horizontal today, but Microsoft has explicitly identified financial services as the vertical with the highest concentration of "Frontier Firms" embedding AI across workflows. When Microsoft decides to add PitchBook and Capital IQ connectors to Copilot -- and they will, because financial services firms are their most valuable enterprise customers -- o11's differentiation evaporates. Building add-ins on Microsoft's platform and calling it a moat is like building a restaurant on someone else's land and calling the lease a competitive advantage. Microsoft controls the APIs, the distribution, the pricing, and the roadmap. That's not a moat -- that's a dependency.

The founders deserve a fair look. Ajay Misra's work scaling AI at Cal AI to $40 million ARR and 10 million users is genuinely impressive product-building experience -- that's real operational credibility. But it's credibility in consumer AI, not in building workflow tools for investment bankers and private equity analysts. Neither founder has documented experience in capital markets. Building credible financial modeling automation -- DCF models, LBO structures, comp tables with the specific formatting conventions bankers demand -- requires the kind of domain knowledge you get from sitting in an analyst seat at 2 AM fixing a model for a managing director who will fire you if the output waterfall doesn't match their mental model. "Bankers told us they were tired of chatbots that couldn't do real work" is a fine customer insight, but Rogo's backers include J.P. Morgan itself, and Hebbia acquired FlashDocs specifically for document-to-draft capabilities. The domain expertise gap compounds the competitive funding gap.

The strongest bull case would be this: o11's M365-native positioning is structurally differentiated from Rogo and Hebbia, which are standalone platforms. Bankers live in Excel and PowerPoint. If o11 becomes the default AI layer inside those apps for finance, the workflow integration creates genuine switching costs. The 150 reviews at 4.8 stars and logos from Wells Fargo and Bank of America suggest real users finding real value. The free tier creates a product-led growth motion that could spread virally within banks before IT procurement even notices. And maybe Microsoft's horizontal positioning permanently prevents them from building vertical financial features, creating a durable gap. For this to work, though, you'd need Microsoft to maintain open add-in APIs indefinitely, Rogo and Hebbia to never build Office integrations (Hebbia already acquired document drafting capability), and o11 to somehow out-execute competitors with 100x their capital on enterprise sales into the most relationship-driven buyer persona in technology. I don't see it.

The primitive test seals it. o11 is not creating a new layer that others build on. There are no network effects -- each user's adoption doesn't improve the product for other users. There's no protocol, no standard, no infrastructure. It's an application on Microsoft's platform consuming APIs from PitchBook and Capital IQ. Compare this to Venmo, which created a peer-to-peer payment primitive, or Helium, which built a decentralized wireless protocol. o11's ceiling is capped by someone else's decisions, and the narrative can never expand beyond "AI tools for professionals who use Office." That's not an infinity story -- it's a features roadmap.

I've watched Birchbox's trajectory sear into my memory the lesson that narrative magnitude without structural moat produces the worst venture outcome. o11 has the inverse problem -- it has neither narrative magnitude nor structural moat. It's a well-executed product in a market that's already been priced by institutional capital, built on a platform controlled by the world's most powerful enterprise software company, competing against startups with hundreds of millions in funding and actual enterprise relationships. The founders have energy and some relevant AI experience, but this is a consensus bet in a consensus market at the worst possible moment to be entering it.
