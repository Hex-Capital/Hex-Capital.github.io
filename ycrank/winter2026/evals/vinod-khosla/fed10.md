# Fed10 -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's the question I keep coming back to with Fed10: if this works perfectly -- if the AI agents produce flawless policy briefs, if every trade association and corporate government affairs team in America subscribes -- what actually changes? Legislative monitoring gets cheaper. Policy consultants lose some billable hours. And the $5.24 billion lobbying industry continues operating exactly as it does today, because lobbying has never been about the analysis. It's about relationships, campaign contributions, and access. The policy brief is the deliverable; the dinner with the committee chair is the product. Fed10 is automating the part of consulting that was already the least valuable, and calling it disruption. The consequence of success here is a solid B2B SaaS company -- maybe worth a few hundred million dollars in a good outcome. That's not a bet I make with my own money.

The founders present an interesting paradox that actually works against them in my framework. Armand Iorgulescu was the youngest Governor appointee in Nevada, passed bills before he could vote, studied Government at Harvard. Winston Wei worked government affairs for Nevada Democrats. These are genuine insiders -- and that's precisely the pattern I've learned to be cautious about. Industry insiders build what the industry already knows it wants. They optimize the existing system by 30% rather than replacing it. When Pat Brown attacked animal agriculture, he'd never set foot in a slaughterhouse -- his naivety was his superpower. When Peter Beck built Rocket Lab, he was a toolmaker from New Zealand who didn't know what aerospace engineers considered impossible. Fed10's founders know exactly what policy consultants deliver, which means they're building a faster version of the same deliverable. That's incremental thinking dressed in AI clothing. Where's the irreverence? Where's the willingness to attempt something the lobbying industry considers absurd -- like making professional lobbying itself obsolete, or democratizing political influence so that a small business owner in Topeka has the same legislative awareness as K Street?

The technology assessment is where this falls apart entirely. The core capability is LLMs analyzing legislative text and producing summaries. Any team with access to GPT-4-class models and a LegiScan API subscription can build this in weeks. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The core technology -- LLMs analyzing legislative text -- is reproducible by any team with access to foundation models and legislative data feeds." USLege raised $2.7 million in May 2025 pursuing the identical value proposition. FiscalNote, with $120 million in annual revenue and thousands of enterprise customers, shipped AI modules in 2024-2025. Quorum, serving over half the Fortune 100, is doing the same. Fed10 is entering a market where the incumbents have the data, the distribution, and the customer relationships, and where the technology moat is approximately zero. When I backed Juniper against Cisco, Pradeep Sindhu had a fundamentally different architecture -- TCP/IP routing versus legacy switching -- that Cisco structurally couldn't replicate without cannibalizing their installed base. Fed10 has no architectural advantage. It has domain expertise, which is replicable with two hires.

To be fair to the bull case: these three founders have a rare and genuine combination of legislative experience and technical capability at a remarkably young age. The co-founder bond is strong -- best friends who passed legislation together. The CTO had an Amazon offer at seventeen. If LLM accuracy for legal text analysis crosses a reliability threshold in the next twelve to eighteen months, and if Fed10 nails the output quality before competitors do, and if they build genuine workflow switching costs through their "lobbyist CRM" approach, there's a path to a meaningful business. The lobbying market grew $768 million year-over-year to $5.24 billion. The Plural Policy acquisition by SAI360 validates market appetite. And the "replace the consultant engagement, not just the data feed" framing is the right strategic instinct -- selling finished work product rather than raw data. If I were evaluating this purely as a business opportunity with a 3x return target, I'd be more interested. But I don't invest for 3x returns. Either the money expires, or you build something that changes how the world operates. Fed10, even in its best case, does neither -- it makes an existing system slightly more efficient for its existing participants.

The timing is acceptable but unremarkable. LLM capability for legal text analysis is a real tailwind, but Fed10 isn't ahead of the curve -- they're arriving simultaneously with multiple competitors who recognized the same opportunity window. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, I was four years early. When I invested in food tech in 2010, I was three years early. Fed10 in 2026 is exactly on time for AI-powered legislative tracking, which means they're competing on execution in a crowded lane rather than benefiting from early-mover positioning. These founders are smart enough to build something valuable -- I just wish they were attacking a problem whose success would matter at a scale that justifies the attempt.
