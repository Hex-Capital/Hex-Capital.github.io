# Sponge -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that jumped out at me immediately: Sponge is building "financial infrastructure for the agent economy" in a market where Stripe (their former employer), Coinbase (with 50 million x402 transactions already), Visa (Intelligent Commerce), Mastercard (Agent Pay), and at least four funded startups -- Catena Labs at $18M from a16z, Payman AI at $13.8M backed by Visa, Skyfire at $9.5M, Natural at $9.8M -- are all converging on the exact same thesis at the exact same time. When I see that kind of landscape, my first question isn't "who has the best product?" It's "is this still an insane idea?" And the answer is definitively no. Agent payments is perhaps the single most consensus bet in fintech right now. Every major payments incumbent and every crypto-fintech VC has already validated this category. The "insane idea" premium has been fully priced in by the market, which means the structural opportunity to generate outsized returns on conviction alone is gone.

The founders clear the "sane" threshold convincingly -- three Stripe crypto infrastructure engineers who built stablecoin financial accounts and core money movement systems. That's real. Building payment infrastructure at Stripe is one of the few credentials that directly maps to building the next generation of payment infrastructure. I think of the Mysten Labs team leaving Meta's crypto division to build Sui -- same pattern of institutional infrastructure builders spinning out to build the next layer. But Sui was building a genuinely new Layer 1 consensus mechanism during a period when most people had written off crypto entirely. Sponge is building a middleware aggregation layer on top of existing rails -- banking, card networks, Solana, Base -- during a period when everyone from Stripe's Patrick Collison to Coinbase's Brian Armstrong is loudly declaring agent commerce the next frontier. Sane person, sane idea. That's the wrong calibration for my portfolio.

My framework specifically asks: "Would this business be good if AI didn't exist?" If you remove AI agents from the picture, Sponge has no customers, no transaction volume, no reason to exist. It's not a business that AI makes better -- it's a business that only AI makes possible. That's the exact opposite of my "cherry on top" test. Compare this to Craftwork: even without any AI, people still need their houses painted, and Craftwork would still have operational advantages from managing crews and scheduling. Sponge without AI is an empty wallet with no one to use it. The entire business thesis depends on AI agents reaching sufficient autonomy AND enterprises trusting those agents with financial authority AND the market not being captured by incumbents with vastly more distribution. That's three simultaneous dependencies, each uncertain.

The structural moat question is where this really falls apart for me. Sponge is pure software infrastructure -- no physical operations, no installed hardware, no regulatory position. This is exactly the category I've been arguing is getting destroyed. "Software companies that had moats are learning they aren't moats anymore." The differentiation today is "fiat plus crypto rails in one platform" -- that's an integration advantage, not a structural moat. Any competitor can add fiat rails to crypto, or crypto to fiat. Stripe literally already has both. And Stripe isn't some slow-moving enterprise that can't serve developers -- the developer market IS Stripe's market. The gap Sponge is trying to exploit between "Stripe's Agentic Commerce targets large merchants" and "Sponge targets developers" is the thinnest possible gap to try to hold against the company that invented developer-first payments infrastructure.

I want to steelman the bull case because the founders deserve it. If agent payments follow the pattern of early internet payments -- where PayPal carved out a massive position despite eBay, Visa, and every bank trying to do the same thing -- then the startup that moves fastest to establish the developer standard wins. The Gateway product, where businesses upload an API spec and agents can self-onboard and pay, could become a genuine new primitive for agent-to-business commerce. If Sponge establishes that spec as the default integration pattern through sheer developer adoption velocity, the network effects between Wallet users and Gateway merchants could create the kind of two-sided lock-in that's hard to replicate even with more resources. The MCP integration and TypeScript SDK give them a plausible wedge into the agent developer ecosystem. And Stripe's historical pattern is to move upmarket over time, not down -- there may be a durable gap at the SMB and indie developer layer. For this to work, though, you need to believe that agent payment protocols are still plastic enough to be shaped by a three-person pre-seed team, and that five better-funded competitors plus three global incumbents won't converge on a standard first. Coinbase's x402 already has 50 million transactions. That's a lot of protocol momentum to overcome.

The narrative magnitude is genuinely large -- "financial infrastructure for the agent economy" is an infinity story if agents become as economically active as projected. But it's a shared infinity story. Every competitor in this space can tell the same narrative, which means the narrative premium is competed away. When I backed Helium, the decentralized wireless infrastructure story was uniquely theirs. Nobody else was telling that story for seven years. Sponge's story is being told by a dozen companies simultaneously, which means the narrative doesn't differentiate -- it just describes the market.
