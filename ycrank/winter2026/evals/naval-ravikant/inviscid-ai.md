# Inviscid AI -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The case studies tell the story before the founders do. HVAC vent optimization, coastal infrastructure stress reduction, storm surge forecasting -- three unrelated domains sharing one technique. This is a team in love with physics-informed neural networks, not with buildings. When I see a founder who has spent years understanding how facilities managers actually make decisions about their mechanical systems -- someone who can tell me something non-obvious about BACnet protocol limitations or why 90% of BMS installations run on default setpoints -- that's specific knowledge I can't train into someone else. What I see here instead is a 19-year-old IOAI gold medalist and a PhD student in computer vision who discovered that PINNs can accelerate CFD and went looking for a market to apply them to. The technique is the thesis, not the domain. That's the wrong way around.

The specific knowledge question is where this breaks down for me. Kabir Jain's AI Olympiad gold is genuinely impressive -- that's raw intellectual horsepower. Ziming Qiu's PhD work in neural networks and medical image segmentation demonstrates real numerical methods depth. But physics-informed neural networks for fluid dynamics is published academic work -- Raissi et al., 2019 is taught in graduate courses now. The knowledge that actually compounds in building optimization isn't the ML layer; it's understanding why a facilities manager at a 500,000-square-foot commercial portfolio won't adopt your system unless it speaks BACnet natively, integrates with their existing Johnson Controls BMS, and doesn't require them to explain physics simulations to their maintenance staff. Neither founder has any documented experience in building science, HVAC engineering, or facilities management. The dossier explicitly notes this gap: "Neither founder has documented prior experience in building science, HVAC systems, or facilities management." That's not a minor gap in a domain where the integration complexity is the product.

The leverage architecture is theoretically sound -- replacing weeks of traditional CFD consulting with real-time simulation is genuine code leverage. One engineer's neural network serves thousands of buildings. That's the right shape. But the delivery mechanism undermines it. Enterprise HVAC optimization requires per-building calibration, sensor deployment, BMS integration, and ongoing support. A two-person team selling to facilities managers at commercial real estate portfolios and data centers is renting out their time, not deploying leverage. Every new customer requires proportional human effort until the platform is mature enough for self-service deployment, which is years away in this domain. The leverage exists in the physics simulation layer but dissolves in the go-to-market reality.

The strongest bull case: data centers are the unlock. AI-driven compute demand has made cooling the binding constraint for new data center capacity, and cooling represents 30-40% of total energy costs. A physics-first optimization tool that can model novel cooling configurations -- liquid cooling, immersion cooling, rear-door heat exchangers -- that no building has encountered before is genuinely more valuable than a pattern-matching approach trained on historical data. If the founders narrowed relentlessly to data center cooling and built the definitive CFD-as-a-service platform for hyperscalers, the specific knowledge gap matters less because data center operators care about physics accuracy, not BMS integration legacy. The PINN approach has a real edge over data-driven competitors in novel configurations. That's a path worth considering. But I don't see evidence the founders have identified this focus -- the case studies point in the opposite direction, toward generalized physics simulation applied wherever.

The timing is consensus, not contrarian. NVIDIA is investing in physics-AI through NVentures. Trane Technologies acquired BrainBox AI for its HVAC optimization capabilities. Johnson Controls put money into PassiveLogic's $74M Series C. PhysicsX has raised roughly $170M applying similar physics-AI techniques to engineering simulation. PassiveLogic has $125M+ and $15M in annual revenue building physics-based digital twins for buildings. Smart money has already validated this category -- which means the pricing reflects optimism, and a two-person pre-seed team is entering a field where the incumbents are not asleep. The question isn't whether physics-based building optimization is a good idea. Everyone already agrees it is. The question is whether these specific founders, without domain knowledge, can out-execute teams with hundred-million-dollar head starts. I don't see the specific knowledge that makes that likely.

I pass. The founders are clearly intelligent -- raw talent isn't the issue. But intelligence without domain-specific knowledge in a consensus market against well-capitalized competitors is a race condition I don't want to bet on. The technique they're applying is published and reproducible. The domain they're applying it to requires knowledge they haven't accumulated. And the timing offers no contrarian edge -- they're entering when the category is already validated and priced accordingly.
