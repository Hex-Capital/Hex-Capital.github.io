# AutoSitu -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Eight named major U.S. cities on the website of a two-person pre-seed company selling into government. San José, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco, Honolulu. That's either the most impressive traction signal in this batch or the most ambiguous. Government procurement is where startups go to die slowly -- 6-to-18-month cycles, budget freezes, political turnover. If AutoSitu has genuine paid relationships with even three of these municipalities, the founders have cracked something that domain knowledge alone doesn't explain. If these are letters of interest or unpaid pilots, the signal dissolves. The dossier doesn't clarify, and the absence of any revenue data leaves the distinction unresolved. But even the ability to get meetings with planning departments in eight major cities tells me something about the founders' credibility in this specific world.

On specific knowledge: Xuanshu Lin's background is the right kind for this problem. Harvard GSD plus University of Michigan in urban planning, hands-on municipal projects in Champaign-Urbana and Detroit -- this is someone who has sat inside the planning review process and watched the friction firsthand. That's not weekend-hackathon domain awareness. Municipal zoning codes are byzantine, jurisdiction-specific, and understood primarily by the people who navigate them daily. Lin's knowledge of why resubmittals happen, which code sections create bottlenecks, how cross-department handoffs break down -- that's experiential, not Google-able. George Zhai from Georgia Tech with autonomous systems and robotics provides the technical co-founder, which checks a structural requirement I consider non-negotiable. The pairing works: one founder who understands the regulatory terrain, one who builds the AI systems to navigate it. But I'd want to probe deeper. Lin's credentials are professional rather than obsessive -- this is the kind of knowledge that other Harvard GSD graduates also possess, not the kind that took a lifetime of peculiar curiosity to develop. It's strong domain expertise, not the Williams-at-Twitter-level pattern recognition that defines my highest-conviction bets.

The leverage architecture is where this company falls short of my framework. AutoSitu makes city reviewers faster. It doesn't make them qualitatively different. A planning department with AutoSitu still operates as a planning department -- processing permits, checking codes, coordinating across departments. The 50-70% reduction in comments and the cut from 2-3 resubmittals to 0-1 are real efficiency gains, but efficiency gains are linear improvements, not leverage creation. Compare this to what Uber did: it didn't make taxi dispatchers faster -- it eliminated the dispatcher entirely and turned every car owner into a driver. Or what Notion did: it didn't speed up document management -- it compressed five tools into one and gave individuals capabilities that previously required teams. AutoSitu is closer to "better software for an existing workflow" than "a new form of capability that didn't exist before." The Code & Precedent Graph is the most interesting structural element -- it has the seeds of a knowledge infrastructure play, like a regulatory Stack Overflow that compounds with each jurisdiction. But today, this is a process optimization tool sold to government agencies one at a time.

The contrarian timing test is where I have the clearest reservation. This is not a bet against a gloomy crowd. This is a bet alongside California's governor, who announced an AI permitting tool in April 2025. PermitFlow has raised $90.5 million. CivCheck was acquired by Clariti. CodeComply, Blitz AI, Cembla -- the space has five-plus funded competitors. "AI to accelerate building permits" is a consensus thesis with consensus capital flowing into it. The specific angle of sitting on the municipal reviewer side rather than the applicant side is a smart go-to-market distinction, but it's a positioning choice, not a contrarian insight. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal. When I invested in Bitcoin, it was dismissed as nerd money. Nobody is dismissing AI for permitting right now -- they're writing checks for it. The asymmetric upside that comes from being right when everyone else is wrong is largely absent here.

The bull case that would change my mind: if AutoSitu's Code & Precedent Graph becomes the authoritative, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction regulatory knowledge base for the United States, this is no longer vertical SaaS -- it's infrastructure. Every architectural drawing checked, every precedent catalogued, every code interpretation documented creates a data asset that compounds and becomes harder to replicate with each new city. The analogy would be Stack Overflow for regulatory compliance -- a knowledge graph that starts as a tool and becomes the system of record. In that scenario, the jurisdictional fragmentation that looks like a scaling constraint becomes a moat: each city's unique code framework is another layer of defensible data that no competitor can shortcut. The municipal switching costs are real, and the housing shortage creates political tailwinds that could accelerate procurement cycles. If Lin's domain knowledge enables faster jurisdictional onboarding than competitors, and if the 8 city relationships convert to paying contracts with expansion rights, the compounding story gets interesting. That's a version of this company I could get behind.

But today, I see a competent team with genuine domain knowledge building useful software for government in a crowded, consensus category. The specific knowledge is real but professional, not extraordinary. The leverage is process acceleration, not capability creation. The timing is consensus, not contrarian. The technology could compound through the Code & Precedent Graph, but that compounding is hypothetical rather than demonstrated. This is a good company that may build a solid business. It is not the kind of asymmetric, non-consensus, leverage-creating bet I write personal checks for.
