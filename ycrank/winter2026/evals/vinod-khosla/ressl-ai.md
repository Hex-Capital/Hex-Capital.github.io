# Ressl AI -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me almost everything I need to know before I evaluate the company itself. Netic has $43M from Founders Fund and Greylock, a $450M valuation, and 1,700% revenue growth in under a year -- building autonomous AI agents for the same essential services vertical. Avoca is YC-backed with $1.4M in revenue doing AI call handling for home services. ServiceTitan, a publicly traded company with a $9.5B market cap, is already shipping AI Voice Agents and SMS Booking Agents into its existing customer base. When I invested in Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router -- they dismissed the technology itself. Here, the incumbents and well-funded startups are not dismissing AI agents for trades. They are building them aggressively. When the experts and incumbents validate the approach rather than reject it, the innovation is typically incremental enough to be non-threatening. That is not a space where I find 100x outcomes.

Let me apply my fundamental test: if Ressl AI succeeds completely, what changes? Trades shops replace 2-4 back-office workers who copy-paste between CCCOne and QuickBooks. Cars still get repaired the same way. HVAC systems still get installed by the same technicians. The physical work is untouched. The consequence of success is a more efficient back office -- a nice business, certainly, but nobody's world operates differently. Compare this to what drew me to Impossible Foods: if Pat Brown succeeded, half the world's arable land could be reclaimed and 25% of global freshwater demand eliminated. Or Commonwealth Fusion Systems: if fusion works, the entire fossil fuel energy system becomes obsolete. Automating the clicking and data entry at a collision repair shop does not register on that scale. The $650-750B home services market sounds large, but Ressl AI's actual addressable surface is the labor cost of administrative staff -- a fraction of a fraction. The field service management software market itself is only $2.8B in the US. Even dominant success produces a mid-tier vertical SaaS company, not an industry transformation.

The pivot pattern concerns me. They started as an AI consulting firm, then built an AI Salesforce administration platform that generated $440K in revenue, and now they have repositioned toward trades businesses. Walking away from revenue to pursue a bigger opportunity can signal genuine learning rate -- and I do give credit for that instinct. But each successive move has narrowed the ambition rather than expanding it. They went from "AI across every industry" to "AI for Salesforce" to "AI back-office for trades." This is a company converging toward a manageable niche, which is precisely the pattern that triggers my strongest negative reaction. They have reduced their failure probability by picking a fragmented market with clear pain points, unsophisticated buyers, and legacy software. Sensible strategy. But sensible strategy that produces inconsequential outcomes is not what I fund.

The strongest bull case: this could be Square for trades. Square looked like a simple card reader for small merchants, and it became a platform that fundamentally changed how millions of small businesses operate financially. If Ressl AI's agents evolve from copy-paste automation into the actual decision-making layer for trades businesses -- pricing, procurement optimization, insurance negotiation, demand forecasting -- and if the PE roll-up channel gives them concentrated distribution (one relationship unlocking dozens of locations), they could build a data flywheel that makes them indispensable. The PE angle is genuinely clever: private equity firms acquiring home services businesses have explicit margin mandates and would deploy AI agents across entire portfolios overnight. That distribution mechanism could overcome the capital disadvantage versus Netic. But for this bull case to work, Ressl AI needs to demonstrate that their agents can do more than automate existing workflows -- they need to show agents making better decisions than the humans they replace. And the dossier shows no public traction data for the current product, no evidence of autonomous decision-making capability beyond task execution, and no moat signals. The technology stack -- LLM agents interacting with APIs -- is explicitly described as accessible to well-funded competitors.

The founders are young, energetic, and clearly capable builders. Arushi Gandhi's hackathon track record and CRM startup experience show hustle, and the willingness to pivot away from $440K in revenue shows she is not optimizing for comfort. But I do not see the outsider-attacks-an-impossible-problem profile that produced my best returns. This is not a biochemist who does not know what the food industry considers impossible, or a New Zealander building rockets without aerospace credentials. This is a technically competent team applying generally available AI technology to a well-understood problem that multiple well-funded competitors are already solving. The approach is sound. The execution may be strong. But sound execution on an incremental problem, in a competitive market, with commodity technology, is exactly the kind of bet where the money does not expire -- it just produces a modest outcome that neither justifies the founders' talent nor my capital's opportunity cost.
