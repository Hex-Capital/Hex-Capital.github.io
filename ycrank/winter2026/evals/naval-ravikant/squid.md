# Squid -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing that catches my attention is that National Grid DSO shipped a live product -- FlexPortal -- built on Squid's platform before this company even has public pricing. At pre-seed. That's not a design partnership or a letter of intent. That's a deployed system at one of the largest distribution system operators on the planet, covered in three trade publications. Most YC companies at this stage are showing mockups. Squid is showing production infrastructure at a regulated utility. That signal is unusual enough to demand explanation, and the explanation is specific knowledge.

George Kolokotronis was Head of Technology at Octopus Energy. Before that, he ran VoltQuant, a geospatial grid intelligence startup that sold to National Grid and Octopus Energy. Before that, Cambridge engineering and AWS AI/ML. Conor Jones worked inside National Grid and Octopus Energy. These founders didn't study the energy grid from the outside and decide it needed better software. They lived inside the broken planning workflows -- the fragmented spreadsheets, the conflicting model versions, the emailed PDFs between teams that should be working from a single source of truth. Kolokotronis already built and sold grid software to these exact customers once. His second attempt compounds on everything the first attempt taught him about utility procurement, data formats, regulatory constraints, and what actually gets adopted versus what gets piloted and abandoned. That layered knowledge -- grid physics from Cambridge, AI/ML from AWS, utility operations from Octopus, enterprise sales motion from VoltQuant -- can't be assembled from a textbook or a six-month research sprint. It's the kind of specific knowledge that emerges from years of genuine obsession with how electricity networks actually work and why their planning tools are decades behind.

The leverage architecture here is real but bounded. Browser-native collaborative grid planning is code leverage applied to an industry still running desktop applications with perpetual licenses. One Squid deployment replaces fragmented tools across an entire planning organization. The "single versioned network model" is an attempt to become the system of record -- which, if it works, creates the kind of institutional lock-in where switching costs grow with every planning cycle, every scenario modeled, every assumption documented. But I have to be honest about the constraint: the addressable universe is utilities and DSOs. There are hundreds globally, not millions. Enterprise sales cycles in regulated utilities run twelve months or longer. This is infrastructure software with strong per-account leverage but slow compounding velocity. The $1.78 billion TAM in distribution system planning is meaningful but not the kind of market where a single company captures winner-take-all dynamics.

The contrarian timing argument is more interesting than it first appears. Most AI-era energy capital is chasing generation -- solar, nuclear, fusion -- or consumption -- data centers, EVs, heat pumps. Grid planning is the bottleneck nobody glamorizes. You can build all the generation capacity you want, but if the distribution network can't absorb it because the planning tools are still desktop-era and fragmented, none of it connects. AI data center demand is projected to triple electricity consumption from data centers alone. That demand doesn't get met unless grid operators can plan faster and collaborate across more stakeholders. Squid is positioning at the constraint layer -- not the sexy investment, but potentially the binding one. However, I can't call this deeply contrarian. Neara just raised $90M at a $1.1B valuation. Venture capital is clearly flowing into grid software. Squid occupies a differentiated wedge within that flow (collaborative planning versus asset management or orchestration), but the broader category is no longer dismissed by smart money.

The strongest bull case: if Squid becomes the standard planning platform for grid operators globally, every regulatory change, every new distributed energy resource, every flexibility market creates more demand for the tool. The incumbents -- Siemens PSS/E, DNV Synergi, Eaton CYME -- are structurally trapped. Migrating from perpetual desktop licenses to cloud-native SaaS would cannibalize their existing revenue and require fundamental rearchitecture. Envelio, the most modern competitor, got acquired by E.ON and is now constrained from selling to E.ON's competitors. The window for a browser-native, collaborative planning platform to establish itself as the new default is open right now -- and Squid has the unusual advantage of having already shipped at National Grid before most competitors in this wedge even exist. If the energy transition accelerates as projected, Squid could be the infrastructure layer that grid modernization runs on.

What holds me back from higher conviction is the leverage ceiling. This is ultimately vertical enterprise SaaS for a slow-adopting customer base. The founders have exceptional domain knowledge, and the early traction is genuinely impressive for pre-seed. But I look for companies where one unit of effort produces a thousand units of output. Utility enterprise sales require sustained, relationship-heavy effort per account. The technology compounds within each deployment, but the deployment itself requires proportional sales effort. I'd want to see how the product expands within accounts after initial adoption -- does the network model become the gravitational center for adjacent workflows, or does it remain a planning-specific tool? The path to disproportionate returns exists but isn't guaranteed. I'd write a small check here, primarily on the strength of the founders' specific knowledge and the FlexPortal deployment as proof that knowledge translates into real product adoption.
