# Perfectly -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I see here is a market with 100+ funded startups converging on the same thesis at the same time. That's not a structural inflection -- that's a consensus stampede. When I look at the AI recruiting space in early 2026, it looks like what crypto token projects looked like in late 2017 or what "Uber for X" companies looked like in 2014: everyone has the same "why now" (LLMs are good enough), the same TAM slide ($32B U.S. recruiting agency market), and roughly the same product architecture (AI sourcing, AI outreach, AI screening). Perfect raised $23M, Alex raised $20M, Dover has $20M+, Gem has $148M. When I invested in Harvey, legal AI looked impossible to most investors -- that was the signal. Recruiting AI looks obvious to every investor. Obvious markets with identical timing theses are where returns go to die.

The business model choice is what I find most analytically interesting, and it concerns me. Perfectly chose the commission/contingency model -- paid only when they fill a role -- which is structurally identical to how Robert Half and traditional recruiting agencies have operated for decades. They're automating the same business model rather than inventing a new one. Compare this to how Stripe didn't just digitize credit card processing -- it created a developer-first integration paradigm that became a distribution channel for entirely new products. Perfectly is replacing the human recruiter with an algorithm but keeping the same revenue structure, the same customer relationship (transactional, per-placement), and the same incentive alignment. A smart toaster with a matching algorithm is still a toaster. The commission model does reduce adoption friction to zero -- hiring managers pay nothing unless it works -- but it also means revenue is lumpy, each customer relationship resets after each placement, and there's no recurring base to build a platform on top of.

The bull case would require a few things to be true: that AI matching quality can become meaningfully and durably better than human recruiters at selecting candidates, that this quality advantage compounds through data accumulation faster than competitors can replicate it, and that the zero-friction commission model drives adoption fast enough to build an unassailable candidate database before the well-funded competitors catch up. If Perfectly's TikTok/Meta recommendation systems expertise translates into genuinely superior matching -- the "2x interview pass rate" claim, if real -- that could matter. Both founders worked on some of the world's most sophisticated recommendation engines, and the 800+ agency-sourced interviews at TikTok give them firsthand knowledge of where traditional recruiting breaks down. A world where Perfectly's candidate-job matching becomes measurably better than competitors, and where that quality gap widens with each placement through accumulated preference data, is a world where this could work despite the crowded market. But that's a big "if" -- recommendation system expertise from social media doesn't automatically transfer to recruiting, and the matching quality advantage would need to be demonstrable and defensible, not just claimed.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is thin. A commission-based recruiting service is a series of transactions, not a platform. Where does the second product come from? Stripe's payment API naturally expanded into Atlas, Billing, and Treasury because every developer who integrated payments also needed those adjacent tools, and Stripe already had the integration relationship. Perfectly fills a role, collects a fee, and the customer relationship is episodic. They could theoretically expand into background checks, onboarding, or HR tools, but the contingency model doesn't create the persistent customer integration that makes multi-product distribution natural. The "reusable candidate AI screens" concept hints at a candidate-side platform, but candidate marketplaces are notoriously difficult to monetize and defend.

On technology cycle positioning, Perfectly is building at the right moment -- LLMs can now conduct credible screening conversations and generate personalized outreach -- but they're arriving simultaneously with the entire market. When I backed Harvey, the team was building ahead of the GPT-4 capability curve, positioning to capture share the moment model fidelity crossed the legal threshold. Perfectly isn't ahead of any curve; they're on it, alongside a hundred other teams who read the same capability reports. The foundation model capabilities they depend on (natural language outreach, conversational screening, semantic candidate matching) are available to every competitor through the same APIs. There's no technical miracle here that Perfectly is uniquely positioned to deliver.

The founders are technically capable -- Victor Luo's TikTok ML Scientist role and Gary Luo's Meta Senior MLE role with NeurIPS publication demonstrate real ML depth. But in a market this crowded, founder quality is necessary-not-sufficient. I've seen great founders repeatedly get crushed by a terrible market structure, and "everyone is building the same thing at the same time with the same tools" is a difficult market structure. The single miracle here should be "matching quality so good it becomes the referral source hiring managers trust over everything else" -- but the dossier doesn't show the founders articulating this with that kind of clarity, and the commoditization of the underlying AI capabilities makes sustaining any matching quality advantage structurally challenging.
