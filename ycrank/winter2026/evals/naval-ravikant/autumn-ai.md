# Autumn AI -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells the story before I even get to the founders. Clay has $204M in funding and expects $100M in revenue. 6sense has raised $526M and does over $200M ARR. Common Room has $105M. Unify has $59M. And all of them are building signal detection as either their core product or an integrated feature. When the dossier itself describes the core capability — monitoring public web sources for changes and filtering by intent — as "technically reproducible," that's not my editorializing. That's the factual assessment. I don't invest in races where four well-funded runners are already at mile 18 and you're lacing up your shoes. "Anyone in this business who's chasing hot markets gets killed." Signal-based selling isn't contrarian — it's a category term that was popularized in 2024-2025. The GTM intelligence space grew at 40% CAGR between 2023-2025. This is peak consensus.

The specific knowledge test is where I start, and it doesn't clear the bar. Vishnu built sourcing technology at Sierra Ventures — a VC firm, not a sales organization. Prospecting for venture deals and prospecting for B2B sales share surface similarities, but the workflows, buyer psychology, and signal-to-noise dynamics are fundamentally different. An SDR managing 200 target accounts needs different signal architecture than a VC analyst sourcing Series A deals. That experience is adjacent, not deep. It's the kind of knowledge you could acquire in six months of embedded work at any GTM team. Shiv's credentials are genuinely impressive on the technical side — NeurIPS paper, SandboxAQ AI residency, serious ML chops. But those are general-purpose AI capabilities applied to a trending category, not specific knowledge about the GTM signal space that couldn't be taught. A grand prize at ISEF for Alzheimer's detection demonstrates raw intelligence, not domain obsession with sales intelligence.

The leverage architecture is the weakest dimension. Autumn AI delivers a filtered feed of buying signals via Slack and email. That's useful, but it's not creating a new form of leverage that didn't exist before. It's making an existing workflow incrementally more efficient. Compare this to what I look for: AngelList created a new category of capital formation that previously required knowing the right people. Replit made programming accessible to people who never would have written code. Notion gave individuals the output of an entire productivity stack. Autumn AI gives sales reps... slightly better monitoring. The same sales rep, doing the same job, with slightly better data. That's a feature, not leverage. And the "Book A Call" sales-led motion at pre-seed, with no pricing page, suggests they haven't found the product-led distribution that would signal genuine individual leverage.

The strongest bull case: LLMs have genuinely changed the economics of parsing unstructured web content, and there is a real pricing gap between $50K-$150K enterprise intent platforms and what SMB sales teams can afford. If Autumn AI could build a signal scoring model that compounds with usage — where every user's ICP definition and signal preference makes the system smarter for everyone — they'd be building something closer to Stack Overflow's knowledge graph than to a monitoring dashboard. The founders are technically capable enough to build that. And the co-founder dynamic — best friends since day one at Columbia, one focused on ML/product, one on AI research — is the kind of relationship that survives hard years. If I squint, there's a version of this where they build the picks-and-shovels signal layer that every GTM tool integrates with rather than competes against. But that path requires them to be infrastructure, not an application — and nothing in their current positioning suggests they're thinking at the protocol layer rather than the product layer.

Both founders are still undergrads at Columbia, with Shiv's expected graduation in 2026. I don't penalize youth — some of the best founders started in college. But combined with a hot market, well-funded competition, and no visible traction signals beyond a live web app, the execution risk compounds. This needed either extraordinary specific knowledge or a genuinely novel technical approach to justify the bet. What I see instead is smart, technically capable people building in a crowded consensus category where the technology doesn't compound and the positioning isn't contrarian. The tagline — "stalk your prospects at scale" — captures the problem precisely: this is about doing existing work faster, not about creating capabilities that didn't exist before.
