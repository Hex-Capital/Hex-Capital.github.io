# Ditto Biosciences -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The premise of Ditto Bio is that evolution has already done the hard work of drug discovery -- that millions of years of host-parasite co-evolution have produced immunomodulatory proteins of extraordinary specificity, and that the pharmaceutical industry is structurally blind to this library because parasitology exists in a different building from drug development. This is an appealing idea. It has the shape of a secret. But when I apply the actual test -- "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" -- the answer is less satisfying than it first appears. The idea that parasitic organisms produce proteins that modulate human immune responses is not a secret. It is established academic science, published extensively in journals including The Lancet and eBioMedicine. Helminth therapy trials have been run for over a decade. The hygiene hypothesis is taught in undergraduate immunology courses. What Ditto adds is systematic computational screening at scale -- analyzing 1M+ proteins across primate-infecting organisms using AI tools that have only recently become available. This is valuable work, but it is an engineering achievement applied to known biology, not a contrarian insight about how the world works. The difference matters enormously: engineering advantages can be replicated by anyone with capital and compute, while genuine secrets create structural barriers to competition.

The competitive landscape reinforces this concern. Seismic Therapeutic has raised $222 million. Anokion has raised $225 million and secured a partnership with Astellas worth up to $760 million. Sonoma Biotherapeutics has raised $335 million and partnered with Regeneron. Pandion Therapeutics was acquired by Merck for $1.9 billion. These are all attacking autoimmune disease through different mechanisms -- ML-optimized cytokines, antigen-specific tolerance, regulatory T-cell therapy, modular protein constructs. Ditto's mechanism (parasite-derived proteins) is genuinely distinct from all of these, which means the company is not in direct mimetic competition at the technology layer. But it is in direct competition at the therapeutic endpoint layer -- they all want to treat the same patients with the same indications through the same FDA pathways. And at the endpoint layer, Ditto brings a $500K Y Combinator check against competitors with hundreds of millions in funding and existing pharma partnerships. The question I always ask is whether a company is building a monopoly or entering a contest, and at the level that matters -- clinical outcomes for autoimmune patients -- this is a contest with very well-armed contestants.

The founding team deserves genuine respect. Adair Borges's publication record (50+ papers, Nature Microbiology, anti-CRISPR patent) and Miller Fellowship represent the highest tier of academic achievement in microbial biology. Dennis Sun's combination of computational biology at Berkeley and operational experience as Chief of Staff at Arcadia Science is unusually well-rounded for a scientist-founder. All three co-founders spent three years together at Arcadia Science, a company explicitly focused on non-model organism biology -- this is perhaps the most precisely aligned founder-market fit I have seen in a biotech company at this stage. These are the right people to attempt this. But the question from my framework is not whether they are excellent scientists -- they clearly are -- but whether they exhibit the kind of definite, obsessive conviction that distinguishes the founders I back. I look for people who have already refused an easier path, who hold a vision of the future so specific that they can describe it in concrete terms rather than probabilistic language. Nothing in the dossier suggests that kind of singular intensity. This reads as accomplished scientists pursuing a logical commercialization of their expertise, which is how most biotech companies start and how most biotech companies die -- slowly, capital-intensively, in the valley of death between academic discovery and clinical proof.

The strongest bull case requires me to take seriously the possibility that the proprietary protein database is itself the monopoly. If Ditto has systematically characterized 1M+ parasite proteins and identified thousands with validated binding affinities in the 1-2 nM range, and if computational tools like AlphaFold have only recently made this screen possible, then there is a narrow window during which Ditto could build an unassailable data moat. The tissue biobank for immunogenicity mapping would compound this advantage. In this scenario, Ditto becomes not a drug company but a discovery platform -- the definitive source of parasite-derived therapeutic candidates, licensing to pharma companies the way Illumina licenses sequencing. The Pandion precedent ($1.9 billion Merck acquisition for protein therapeutics in autoimmune) validates the exit path. If the platform generates ten candidates across multiple indications, the portfolio approach partially mitigates binary clinical trial risk. I take this case seriously. What prevents me from investing is that the underlying approach -- screen parasite genomes computationally for immunomodulatory proteins -- is methodologically reproducible by any well-funded competitor with access to the same genomic databases and the same AI tools. The data advantage is real but may be temporary.

Biotech has always been difficult for my framework. The timelines are long, the capital requirements are massive, the outcomes are binary, and the regulatory gauntlet creates a decade-long gap between insight and monopoly. I have made exceptions when the technology represents a genuine 0-to-1 discontinuity at the civilizational level -- when the company, if successful, makes a previously impossible thing possible. Ditto Bio makes a known thing more systematic. The evolutionary biology angle is intellectually elegant, and the team is formidable, but I do not see the contrarian secret or the structural path to monopoly that my framework demands. This is a well-conceived drug discovery company in a market crowded with well-funded competitors pursuing the same clinical endpoints. I pass.
