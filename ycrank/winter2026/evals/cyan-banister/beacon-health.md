# Beacon Health -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Beacon Health: AI agents for primary care value-based care workflows is one of the most popular categories in venture right now. $10.7 billion flowed into AI health tech startups in 2025. Aledade just hit $1 billion in revenue. Innovaccer raised at $3.45 billion. Elation Health is shipping AI features into its EHR at no additional cost to practices. Athelas launched an entire AI-integrated EHR last year. When I look at this landscape, every signal that usually gets me excited is inverted — this is popular, it's straightforward to assess, and the technology risk feels incremental rather than fundamental. The companies I've made money on, the ones that changed my life and my portfolio, they all shared something in common at the moment I wrote the check: nobody else wanted them. That's not the case here.

Now, when I sit with Mark Pothen's story, I feel something real. He grew up in his mother's primary care practice. That's not a thesis someone wrote on a whiteboard — that's dinner table conversation about insurance denials and prior auth nightmares. He then went and spent six months embedded inside a practice, owning operations and augmenting them with AI. He co-founded a PPE distribution network during COVID that coordinated 200+ people. There's a thread here connecting biography to problem, and I respect it. But growing up around a problem and being forged by it are different things. The founders I've backed who built enduring companies — they didn't just observe the pain, they were shaped by it in ways that made quitting psychologically impossible. I'd want to hear Mark tell me about the moment this became an obsession, not just a career direction. And Obinna's healthcare connection feels more professional than personal — strong AI engineering credentials from Jasper and LinkedIn, but where's the biographical thread tying him to primary care specifically?

The piece that does resonate with my framework is something I think most investors would overlook: this is really a story about preserving independent medicine. The big VBC enablers — Aledade, agilon, Privia — they don't just sell software, they absorb practices into their networks and take on risk. For an independent physician association or a small ACO, those models mean surrendering autonomy. Beacon is positioning as the "stay independent" option — a software layer that lives inside your existing EHR and helps you compete in value-based care without handing your practice over to a network. That's an invisible system being made visible: the administrative complexity of VBC is an unseen barrier that's forcing consolidation, and consolidation destroys access for patients in underserved communities who depend on independent primary care. When I think about Uber creating income for drivers or Affirm making credit transparent, this rhymes — helping small practices survive preserves both physician livelihood and patient access. But the founders haven't explicitly framed it this way, which makes me wonder whether they see the structural play or are focused more narrowly on workflow automation.

If I'm being honest about the bull case: the timing is genuinely interesting. LLMs just crossed a reliability threshold for clinical workflows, and the VBC shift is structural and accelerating — more than half of U.S. healthcare payments now flow through these models. Independent practices are drowning in administrative burden and can't afford to hire the staff or consultants to manage it. The incumbents' business models create real conflicts — Epic doesn't want to be a VBC performance company, Aledade doesn't want practices to stay independent, and Innovaccer requires heavy integration work. A lightweight, EHR-agnostic agent layer that just works could be the wedge. And they're already live with one IPA managing 40,000 patients, which at pre-seed is meaningful proof that the product functions in a real clinical environment. If Pothen can sell to IPAs and ACOs faster than incumbents can ship comparable agentic features, there's a window. But it's a window, not a moat — and I've learned that in consensus categories, windows close fast.

The co-founder dynamic is a blank page to me. No shared prior employer, no university overlap, both relatively early in their careers. After what happened with HQ Trivia — a product that was genuinely transformative, destroyed by irreconcilable founder conflict — I never invest without understanding how co-founders fight. Two people building in healthcare, where regulatory surprises and clinical liability create enormous stress, need to have already tested their relationship under pressure. I don't see evidence of that here.

I keep my checkbook closed on this one. Not because the founders aren't capable or the problem isn't real — it's both. But I've built my portfolio on the principle that the best investments look wrong to almost everyone at the time you make them. Beacon Health looks right to almost everyone right now. It's a well-understood problem, a popular category, with well-funded incumbents moving in the same direction. When I feel the pull of consensus, I've learned to trust that instinct — it means the weirdness has already been arbitraged away, and the risk-reward calculus doesn't favor the earliest check.
