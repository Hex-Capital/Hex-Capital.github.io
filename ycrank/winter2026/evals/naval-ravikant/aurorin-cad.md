# Aurorin CAD -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Michael Baron spent four years building a multi-GPU graphics engine that renders entire cityscapes at hundreds of frames per second across multiple monitors. Not as a job. Not as a class project someone assigned him. As the thing he chose to do with his time from 2018 to 2022, apparently while still a student. That's the signal. You cannot teach someone to spend four years building a rendering engine for no external reason. That's specific knowledge being acquired through genuine obsession -- the kind of knowledge that exists outside any curriculum. Add three SpaceX internships doing combustion simulation and guidance systems, plus Apple GPU driver optimization, and you have someone whose entire technical life has been building toward one capability: making computers manipulate geometry and physics faster than anyone thought possible. A CAD kernel is the natural convergence point of everything this founder has ever worked on.

The deeper insight is that Aurorin is not really a CAD application. It's a CAD *kernel* -- and that distinction matters enormously. Every major CAD tool in the world runs on one of two kernels built in the 1980s: Parasolid or ACIS. SolidWorks, NX, Creo, Fusion 360 -- they're all different interfaces on the same ancient geometry engines. When Aurorin builds a new kernel from scratch, optimized for modern GPUs and designed for AI manipulation from day one, it's building infrastructure, not an application. This is a picks-and-shovels play disguised as a product. If the kernel works, the desktop CAD tool is just the first surface. Other applications, integrations, and AI agents could build on top of it. That's the leverage architecture I look for -- one engineering effort that creates value across multiple surfaces. My portfolio leans toward infrastructure for exactly this reason: Alchemy didn't build a DeFi app, it built the API layer underneath all of them.

The contrarian angle is more nuanced than it first appears. "AI for CAD" is trending toward consensus -- Zoo has $10M, Adam has $4M, Hestus has $1.5M, and PTC bolted an AI advisor onto Onshape last October. But none of these competitors built a new kernel. Zoo wraps its own geometry engine with a text-prompt API. Hestus plugs into existing SolidWorks. Adam generates 3D assets from text. They're all working at the application layer, accepting the legacy kernel as a given. Baron's bet is that the kernel itself is the bottleneck -- that you can't make CAD genuinely AI-native by adding intelligence on top of a geometry engine designed before neural networks existed. That's a contrarian position *within* an increasingly consensus category, and it's the more interesting kind of contrarian: not "everyone's wrong about the market" but "everyone's wrong about the architecture."

The bull case is strong enough that I need to name it explicitly: if Baron has actually built a functioning parametric B-Rep kernel -- even a basic one -- the technical moat is real and compounding. Each additional geometric operation, each edge case handled, each performance optimization makes the kernel harder to replicate. Onshape was acquired by PTC for $470M, and it was built on the *same old kernel* just moved to the cloud. A ground-up kernel designed for AI-native manipulation in an era of compute abundance could be worth multiples of that. The $12B CAD market has the kind of structural rigidity -- decades of legacy lock-in, certified manufacturing workflows, backward compatibility constraints -- that protects incumbents right up until the moment a new architecture makes the old one irrelevant. Baron's SpaceX and Apple pedigree gives him credibility with exactly the hardware engineers who would adopt a new tool.

But I have to be honest about what concerns me. This is a solo founder attempting one of the most complex software engineering projects imaginable. Parasolid was built by teams of dozens over years. A parametric B-Rep kernel that handles real-world manufacturing tolerances, complex assemblies, industry-standard file formats, and edge cases accumulated over four decades of CAD development -- that's not a sprint, it's a marathon measured in decades. There is zero evidence of users, revenue, or even specific customer conversations. And critically, Baron's specific knowledge is on the *engine* side, not the *user* side. He knows how to make geometry compute fast. But does he understand why a mechanical engineer reaches for SolidWorks at 6 AM and what would make them reach for something else? The gap between building a brilliant kernel and building a product that engineers trust with their production workflows is filled with file format compatibility, simulation integrations, certification requirements, and thousands of workflow details that emerge from years of watching users, not from writing GPU shaders. The solo founder risk amplifies all of this -- a technical co-founder is already on the team, but there's nobody bringing the user domain knowledge or the go-to-market muscle.

I lean toward a small bet here. The specific knowledge is genuine and deep at the technical layer. The infrastructure architecture creates the right kind of leverage. The technology compounds in ways that get harder to replicate over time. But it's a physics-first bet, closer in spirit to my Extropic investment than to my software portfolio -- you're betting that a singular technical mind can create something fundamentally new at the compute layer, knowing that most of the application-layer problems remain unsolved. I'd write a check, but I'd want to understand two things first: has any working engineer actually used this kernel to design something real, and does Baron have a plan to bring on someone who understands the user side as deeply as he understands the engine side.
