# Bubble Lab -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Bubble Lab isn't the product or the founders -- it's how crowded and obvious the space has become. AI-powered workflow automation is one of the most consensus categories in all of enterprise software right now. Zapier is already shipping AI automation features. n8n just raised $240 million at a $2.5 billion valuation and has integrated LangChain across seventy-plus nodes. Make got acquired by Celonis. Activepieces is YC-backed with 20,000 GitHub stars. When I look at a company, I ask myself: is this unpopular? Is it difficult to assess? Does it have real technology risk? Bubble Lab fails all three tests. "Use an LLM to turn natural language into API calls across SaaS tools" is not a contrarian insight in 2026 -- it's a feature that every incumbent is racing to ship. The core technical capability is reproducible, and the dossier itself acknowledges the commoditization risk. This is the opposite of the signal I've spent my career learning to trust. The best opportunities I've found -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- were ones where other investors actively didn't want to be. Here, everyone wants to be.

When I try to understand the founders' story -- not the business, just how they got here -- I find two impressive young graduates from Cornell Tech with strong credentials. Selina Li was a quant researcher at JPMorgan. Zach Zhong is described as a 3x founding engineer with eight years building automation solutions. They're clearly capable. They applied to YC three times before getting accepted, which tells me something about persistence. But what I'm listening for is the biographical thread that connects this specific founder to this specific problem -- the lived experience that means they won't quit when things get brutal. And what I find instead is a pivot. Less than a year ago, these founders were building gymii.ai, a consumer nutrition tracking app. That's not workflow automation. That's not ops tooling. That's a completely different domain, different customer, different distribution model. When I see a pivot that fast into a category this hot, the pattern I recognize is founders reading the market rather than solving their own pain. I've learned to be cautious about that signal -- the founders who persist through the inevitable crises are usually the ones who can't not work on this problem because it's woven into their biography.

To be fair to Bubble Lab, there's a bull case worth articulating. The 3,800 business professionals using the platform is a real number at pre-seed -- it suggests something is working in the product. The Slack-native distribution angle is genuinely clever: meeting ops teams where they already live, with a stated setup time under one minute, creates a frictionless adoption loop that Zapier's separate-app model can't easily replicate. The SOC 2 Type 1 certification at this stage shows uncommon operational discipline. And the "prompt once, automate forever" framing -- where successful one-time actions get promoted to autonomous workflows -- is an elegant product mechanic that could create the kind of compounding data moat that makes switching painful over time. If Pearl's long-term memory genuinely learns institutional knowledge and process preferences, that switching cost could be real. If these founders are the rare team that can outexecute billion-dollar incumbents on speed and UX quality, and if the Slack-native wedge proves defensible enough to build a broader platform, this could work. But "outexecute incumbents in a consensus category" is an execution bet, not a conviction bet, and those aren't the bets that have defined my portfolio.

The economic access dimension is where this falls furthest from what I look for. The companies that excite me most -- Uber, Postmates, Affirm, Thumbtack -- create real economic opportunity for people who previously lacked it. They make invisible systems visible and give underserved populations agency they didn't have before. Bubble Lab is a productivity tool for ops professionals at companies that already use Slack, Jira, Notion, and Stripe. That's a real business, but it's optimization for the already-employed, not access creation for the excluded. I also can't ignore the platform dependency risk. Building your entire product on Slack's infrastructure means your fate is partially in someone else's hands. Slack is actively investing in AI features. If they decide to build native workflow automation -- and why wouldn't they? -- Bubble Lab's core distribution advantage evaporates overnight. My years at IronPort taught me to think carefully about where you sit in the technology stack and who controls the layers above and below you.

The co-founder dynamic is the one bright spot that registers on my framework. Selina and Zach met at Cornell Tech, built gymii.ai together, navigated a pivot together, and survived three YC rejections together. That shared history through setbacks is meaningful. I learned from HQ Trivia that even perfect timing and perfect product can't survive broken co-founder dynamics, so I pay close attention to this. Two founders who've already weathered a failed product and multiple rejections while staying aligned have at least demonstrated basic resilience. But I don't have enough information about how they actually resolve disagreements under real pressure -- a pivot and rejected applications are stressful, but they're not existential in the way a company crisis is.

I respect what these founders have built in a short time, and I genuinely wish them well. But this isn't my kind of bet. The category is consensus, the founder-problem connection feels opportunistic rather than biographical, and the product serves optimization rather than access. I'm passing.
