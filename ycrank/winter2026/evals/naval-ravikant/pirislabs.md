# Piris Labs -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Ali Khalatpour built the optical engine for NASA's GUSTO mission -- a terahertz emission source that flew on a balloon observatory to map the interstellar medium. That's not something you pick up at a hackathon. His path from MIT's terahertz quantum cascade laser research to Stanford's photonics lab to Harvard's Capasso Group represents a decade of accumulated insight into how light behaves in semiconductor systems. When I evaluate specific knowledge, I ask whether the founder possesses understanding that would take a competitor years to replicate even if they knew exactly what to build. Khalatpour passes that test. The physics of photonic device design at the level required for data center interconnects lives in the hands and intuition of maybe a few hundred people worldwide, and he's been one of them since his PhD. Moghadam's AI/ML infrastructure background from Meta and X complements the hardware side, though scaling ML systems at big tech is a skill shared by thousands of engineers -- it's useful but replaceable. The CEO's knowledge is the irreplaceable asset here.

The problem is that Khalatpour's specific knowledge, as rare as it is, has already been recognized by the market. Over $1.5 billion has flowed into photonic AI infrastructure: Lightmatter at $850M and a $4.4B valuation, Ayar Labs backed by NVIDIA and AMD and Intel with $370M+, Olix at $250M and a billion-dollar valuation, Neurophos at $118M with Gates Frontier behind it. The photonic thesis for AI inference is not a secret. It is not a contrarian bet. It is consensus among the most informed hardware investors on the planet. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, the smart money thought it was a toy. When I backed Uber at a $4M valuation, ride-sharing was literally illegal. The asymmetric upside in those bets came from being right when the crowd was wrong. Here, the crowd is already right -- they've just placed much larger bets. A two-person team with pre-seed capital entering a space where competitors have multi-year head starts and three orders of magnitude more funding is not contrarianism. It's late arrival.

The full-stack inference service model -- selling outcomes (cost per token) rather than components -- is the one genuinely interesting strategic choice. Lightmatter and Ayar Labs sell photonic chips to data center operators; Piris Labs wants to own the entire stack and sell inference directly. This mirrors how NVIDIA's dominance came not from GPUs alone but from CUDA plus chips plus ecosystem lock-in. In principle, vertical integration of proprietary photonic hardware with a purpose-built software layer creates switching costs and margin structure that component sellers can't match. But vertical integration in hardware is the most capital-intensive play in the space. You need to design the chips, fabricate them, build the infrastructure to run them, and then operate the inference service on top. Neurophos raised $118M and won't have chips until mid-2028. The capital intensity mismatch between what this company needs and what it has isn't a gap -- it's a chasm.

The bull case I take seriously: Khalatpour's terahertz-to-photonics trajectory represents a type of physics intuition that transcends specific product categories. If he can demonstrate a working prototype with anything close to the claimed 5x latency and 10x power improvements, this team becomes one of the most attractive acquisition targets in photonic AI. The technology, if it works, compounds -- each generation of photonic devices benefits from manufacturing learning and integration refinement. And my portfolio has shifted toward deep-science hardware bets since 2022: Extropic, Atomic Semi, Belfort. I am intellectually sympathetic to founders who understand physics at first principles and believe they can build better compute infrastructure. But Extropic is pursuing thermodynamic computing -- a physics paradigm so novel that almost no one else is working on it. That's a contrarian bet on a new category of leverage. Piris Labs is entering a category where the leverage has already been identified and capitalized by players with vastly more resources.

I respect the specific knowledge. I respect the infrastructure ambition. But the absence of any prototype, benchmark data, or customer signal combined with competitors who have shipped 15,000+ optical units (Ayar Labs) and are generating estimated $50M in revenue (Lightmatter) means I'm being asked to bet that two exceptional physicists can outrun a billion dollars of head start with pre-seed money and no visible hardware. The founder-problem fit is strong. The capital-problem fit is not. I'd want to see a working prototype, a fab partnership, or a technical insight that invalidates the competitors' approach entirely before writing a check. Right now, the specific knowledge is real but the competitive dynamics make this a consensus bet at the worst possible entry point.
