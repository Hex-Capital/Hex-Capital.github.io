# Beyond Reach Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Beyond Reach Labs is the shadow of SpaceX hanging over everything. SpaceX was my very first angel check -- I wrote it when private space was considered lunacy. Now here's Pele Collins, who spent seven years at SpaceX and personally led the engineering on the Crew Dragon parachutes that brought NASA astronauts home from the space station -- the first crewed parachute return since Apollo. That credential isn't just a resume line. That's someone who has held astronaut lives in their hands through a piece of deployable hardware, and is now building a company around deployable hardware in space. And Mitchell Fogelson didn't just study space structures -- his entire PhD at CMU was specifically about designing, optimizing, and simulating the metamaterial mechanisms that became Beyond Reach Labs' core product. NASA literally funded that research. When I ask myself whether these two are "genuinely the right people to tackle their specific problem," the answer is clearly yes. But here's what I keep turning over: being technically the right people isn't the same as hearing a story that makes me understand why they *have* to do this. The biographical thread connecting founder to problem feels more like career progression than personal necessity. I'd want to sit across from them and hear something deeper -- something about what drives them beyond the engineering elegance.

The technology itself has that quality I recognize from Crusoe Energy -- a technical insight that sounds absurd until you understand the physics. Solar arrays that grow to football-field size in orbit using scissor-truss metamaterials with a 20:1 extension ratio? That's genuinely strange, and the kind of thing most investors would struggle to diligence. The PETS and HERDS architectures are patent-pending, rooted in years of PhD research, and validated in NASA zero-gravity flight experiments. When I look at Redwire's roll-out blanket approach and the way their ROSA arrays trade off structural rigidity at extreme scale, I see a classic innovator's dilemma -- Redwire can't easily abandon their $304M-revenue architecture to adopt a fundamentally different geometry. That kind of structural competitive advantage in a hard-to-enter space is exactly what I mean when I say defensibility and moat matter at the earliest stages. The AFRL advisor with 25 years of experience and the MIT faculty co-advisor add institutional gravity that's unusual for a two-person pre-seed.

But here's where my conviction wavers: is this genuinely non-consensus? When I backed SpaceX, or Crusoe when they were mining Bitcoin on gas flares, nobody else wanted in. The most promising companies are not popular -- they're the ones other investors pass on. Beyond Reach Labs is entering a market where SpaceX just filed for a million-satellite orbital datacenter constellation, Google announced Project Suncatcher, and Starcloud is proposing 88,000 datacenter satellites. The tailwind is real, but it also means this company is surfing a wave that every space investor can see. The $175M in LOIs from space companies at pre-seed is either an extraordinary validation signal or a sign that this market is heating up enough for customers to hand out letters of intent freely. Either way, the "weird and dismissed" quality I look for has been partially arbitraged away by the orbital datacenter hype cycle. If those mega-constellation timelines slip -- and speculative space timelines almost always slip -- the near-term demand evaporates quickly.

The co-CEO structure gives me pause in a way I can't ignore. After HQ Trivia -- which failed entirely because of co-founder conflict despite perfect product-market timing -- I probe deeply into how co-founders handle disagreements. Collins and Fogelson have known each other thirteen years, since their freshman year at Penn, and their complementary skill sets (flight hardware operations versus fundamental research) suggest natural lane division. That's meaningful. But co-CEO means they haven't resolved who makes the final call when they disagree about something existential, and in a capital-intensive space hardware company with multi-year development cycles, those existential moments will come. I'd want to understand their decision-making protocol before writing a check.

What would make this a great investment for me? If Collins told me a story about growing up in South Africa that made space power personal -- something about energy access or infrastructure scarcity that connects his biography to the mission of powering space. If the $175M in LOIs converted to even one binding contract before the in-space demo. If the orbital datacenter timeline proved out and this team was the only one who could deliver arrays at the scale required. The bones are strong: legitimate technology, deep founder-market fit on the technical dimension, a real innovator's dilemma against incumbents, and the kind of regulatory and qualification complexity that creates moats I'm comfortable with. This reminds me of Anduril in its willingness to operate in a sector where the qualification barriers deter most early-stage competitors. But I don't feel the jolt -- that intuitive energy I felt with Niantic or the visceral excitement of Crusoe's weirdness. This is a company I respect more than one that pulls me forward with conviction. I'd want a deeper conversation with these founders before I knew whether the fire was there.
