# Overshoot -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Overshoot: it's an AI infrastructure play in the single hottest investment category of 2025-2026, built by two technically credentialed founders from Uber, Meta AI, and Intel. Every fund in Silicon Valley is writing checks into inference infrastructure right now. The rounds are oversubscribed. The pitch decks are polished. The market maps are circulating on every partner's desk. And that right there is my problem. I've learned -- sometimes painfully -- that the most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. Overshoot is neither of those things. A two-person team building faster video inference APIs is legible, assessable, and sits squarely in the consensus bucket. I don't feel the jolt. I feel the crowd.

When I ask "tell me your story," what I get from the dossier is an impressive résumé, not a survival narrative. Zakaria graduated top of his class at LSE, earned a Master's at MIT, spent seven years building surge pricing at Uber, wrote GPU kernels at Meta AI. Younes was a founding engineer at COSMONiO, a computer vision company Intel acquired in 2020, where he built a training and serving platform from scratch. These are genuinely strong technical credentials -- maybe the best founder-market fit on the technical dimension I've seen in this batch. But technical fit and biographical stake are different things in my world. I want to know what hardship forged the obsession. What's the personal thread that makes this specific problem feel like destiny rather than opportunity? The Moroccan-to-Silicon-Valley journey that both cousins made likely contains real grit I can't see from public records, and I don't want to discount what I can't observe. But the signal isn't surfacing, and when I can't hear the founder's story, my primary evaluation channel is blocked.

The one thing that genuinely lights up my pattern recognition is the cousin co-founder dynamic. After HQ Trivia destroyed itself through irreconcilable co-founder conflict -- "the right time, the right product" and it still failed -- I started looking explicitly at how co-founders handle disagreement. I've come to appreciate family-run businesses because the trust infrastructure is already built. Zakaria and Younes are cousins who bring complementary and independent domain expertise (inference systems and computer vision, respectively) with no overlapping employment history. That complementarity within a family bond is the kind of resilience structure that survives the hard moments. This is the dimension where Overshoot scores strongest against my criteria, and it's meaningful.

Now let me make the bull case honestly, because the technical argument here is real. Zakaria didn't just work at Uber -- he built the low-latency, high-throughput systems that power surge pricing. He didn't just work at Meta -- he wrote GPU kernels and inference engines. Younes didn't just work in computer vision -- he built the platform that Intel paid to acquire. The claim of sub-200ms vision model inference, if it holds, represents genuine engineering achievement. And the "focus as moat" argument has precedent -- Twilio specialized in communications when AWS could have eaten that market, Stripe specialized in payments when PayPal seemed unbeatable. Real-time video inference is genuinely different from text inference at the protocol and codec level. If these founders can build deep enough optimization advantages in the video streaming stack before Fireworks ($331M raised) or Together ($534M raised) decide to prioritize it, there's a version of this that becomes the standard infrastructure layer for video AI agents. That's a big outcome.

But the bear case is what keeps pulling me back. The SDK integration is "3 lines of code" -- which means low switching costs for developers. The underlying models (Qwen, InternVL) are open-source and not controlled by Overshoot. The 300-to-1,000 developer count without any revenue signal or production deployment evidence leaves engagement depth ambiguous. And the competitive surface is enormous: not just venture-funded inference startups, but AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, all of whom have GPU infrastructure, existing developer relationships, and the ability to offer video vision APIs at marginal cost. When I backed Crusoe Energy, the insight was genuinely weird -- turning waste gas into computation in North Dakota. When I backed Contraline, it was male contraceptive gel that every other VC had passed on. Overshoot is building faster infrastructure in the category that every investor already understands and wants exposure to. The absence of economic access creation -- no visible mechanism for helping underserved populations or making invisible systems transparent -- further distances this from the kinds of bets that have defined my portfolio. I respect what Zakaria and Younes have built technically, and the cousin bond gives me real comfort on team durability, but this isn't my bet to make.
