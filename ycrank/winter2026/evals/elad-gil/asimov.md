# Asimov -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment for robotics training data is real -- $7.2B in robotics VC in 2025, Figure AI at a $39B valuation, China funding 40 dedicated training centers. When an entire category of well-funded companies simultaneously hits the same bottleneck (data for embodied AI), that's a genuine infrastructure need, not a manufactured market. But here's my problem: this is not a non-obvious market. It's a consensus-obvious market. Scale AI -- a $29B company with $870M in 2024 revenue -- launched its Physical AI division in 2025 specifically to address this need. Two other YC companies from adjacent batches (Sensei S24, Cortex AI F25) are attacking the same space. When I invested in PagerDuty, nobody else thought operations alerting was interesting. When I invested in Coinbase, crypto infrastructure scared most software investors. The robotics data gap, by contrast, has a line of funded startups and an $870M-revenue incumbent competing for it. That changes the investment calculus fundamentally.

The headband camera approach has a specific insight worth acknowledging: organic human activity data -- how people actually navigate kitchens, fold laundry, stock shelves -- may be more valuable for robot training than scripted teleoperation demonstrations in labs. Robots need to learn from the messy reality of physical environments, not controlled setups. Asimov's 5,000+ contributors across three continents capturing this organic data is a differentiated data asset relative to Scale AI's SF R&D lab or Sensei's exoskeleton arm. But the differentiation is methodological, not structural. A headband camera is not proprietary technology. A gig worker network has zero switching costs -- the same person can wear a competitor's headband tomorrow. Compare this to Stripe, where the developer integration created real switching costs: ripping out Stripe's API requires re-engineering your entire payment stack. Asimov's contributor network takes time to build but involves no deep technical moat, and Scale AI has the resources and existing contractor relationships to replicate it in months if the approach proves superior.

The product-to-distribution trajectory concerns me most. Asimov collects data and sells it to robotics labs. That's a service, not a platform. Scale AI started as data labeling but became the interface between AI labs and the entire data supply chain -- then distributed evaluation, RLHF, red-teaming, and now physical AI through that same customer relationship. Where is Asimov's equivalent expansion? Could they move into simulation data generation, robot evaluation benchmarks, or deployment monitoring? Maybe, but I see no evidence the team has articulated a multi-product vision. At pre-seed, I don't expect a detailed roadmap, but I need to see that the founders understand they're building a distribution channel, not just a data product. Without that trajectory, this is a company that can be commoditized by any well-resourced player who decides to deploy headband cameras at scale.

The strongest bull case: this is the picks-and-shovels play for the humanoid robot gold rush. If humanoid robots follow the adoption curve I'm tracking -- from factory pilots in 2026 to commercial deployment by 2028-2029 -- the data hunger will be enormous and insatiable. Asimov's first-mover network, with its diversity of environments and geographies, could become the de facto training corpus the way ImageNet became the benchmark for computer vision. The contributor network's value compounds with diversity: every new household, factory, and cultural context makes the dataset harder to fully replicate. And the unit economics could be exceptional -- if data sells at $100-$500/hr and contributors cost $20-$30/hr, gross margins before annotation could be 70%+. For this to work, Asimov would need to lock in multi-year contracts with the top 5-10 robotics labs, build annotation automation that drives margins up as volume scales, and establish the dataset as a quality standard that customers depend on. That's a plausible path, but it requires winning enterprise deals against Scale AI's existing sales machine, which brings us back to the distribution problem.

The execution signal is real. Building a 5,000+ contributor network across three continents and collecting "thousands of hours" of data as a pre-seed company with a team of three is genuine velocity. That operational achievement suggests the founder can build and ship, which I weight heavily from my own experience building at Google and Color. But the founder profile gives me pause -- a recent Berkeley CS graduate with startup experience at early-stage companies but no prior founding experience and no deep robotics domain expertise. The YC page describes "defense tech robotics researcher," but the evidence is thin: an NSF-funded summer research program and the title itself. Competing against Scale AI's enterprise sales team and Cortex AI's founder (ex-Carousell co-founder with a $1B+ exit) requires a level of GTM sophistication that I haven't seen demonstrated. The single-miracle test is also unclear: is the miracle "build the network" or "win the enterprise contracts" or "maintain data quality at scale across distributed unscripted collection"? When I can't identify one miracle in one sentence, that's usually because the business requires several.

I'm passing. The market's structural inflection is real, but it's consensus, not non-obvious. The product has no clear path to becoming a distribution channel. The competitive threat from Scale AI is material and immediate. And the approach -- while clever -- lacks the kind of structural defensibility I need to see. This feels more like a data services business that will face margin compression as competition intensifies than an infrastructure platform that compounds. The headband is a smart toaster moment: it's a tool bolted onto what is fundamentally a gig-economy data collection operation, not a software-driven platform where technology creates compounding advantages.
