# FullSeam -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

I know this team. Khosla Ventures wrote a check into TaxProper, their first company. They built it, scaled it to processing over a billion dollars a year in property tax payments, and sold it to Opendoor. That's a real accomplishment -- three founders who survived the full lifecycle together, from YC S19 through acquisition. And now they've come back with their second company, and my honest reaction is: these founders are too talented to spend their next decade making accounting departments 30% smaller.

Let me start where I always start -- the consequence of success. If FullSeam works perfectly, what changes? Mid-market companies have AI agents that send invoice follow-ups, match POs, and categorize expenses. Their finance teams shrink from eight people to three. The company captures some fraction of a $3-7 billion AR/AP automation market. That's a decent business. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The global financial system operates exactly as it does today, just with slightly fewer people entering data into QuickBooks. I've seen this pattern hundreds of times -- founders who've had a successful exit channel their ambition into something safe, something they know works, something with a clear market and obvious customers. They've optimized away the risk of failure, and in doing so, they've made the upside inconsequential.

What concerns me more is the competitive signal. When Bill.com has already launched "BILL AI Agents" and Tipalti raises $200M specifically to build AI capabilities in accounting automation, that tells me something important: the incumbents don't find this threatening. They're absorbing it. Compare this to Juniper -- when I backed Pradeep Sindhu to build TCP/IP routers for public telecom networks, Cisco's CTO told me they would never do it. The incumbents dismissed the approach as impossible. Here, Bill.com is literally building the same thing on top of a platform with 500,000 existing SMB customers and 9,000 accounting firms. When the incumbents validate your approach instead of dismissing it, you're not disrupting -- you're competing. And at pre-seed against a $1.5 billion revenue incumbent that's already copying your playbook, the math is brutal.

The technology layer reinforces this concern. The dossier states it plainly: "The underlying LLM capabilities powering AI agents are widely available." FullSeam's value proposition is integrations across nine platforms and workflow orchestration -- real engineering work, but replicable by any well-funded team. There's no physics breakthrough here, no novel scientific insight, no technology that creates a structural economic shift. It's execution and integration quality, which are necessary but not sufficient for the kind of returns I look for. When I backed Square, mobile payments didn't just improve existing POS infrastructure -- they made it structurally obsolete for an entire class of merchants who couldn't access payments at all. FullSeam isn't creating a new capability; it's automating an existing one more efficiently.

The strongest bull case would require believing that "AI employee for finance" is a wedge into something much larger -- that once you automate AR/AP, you expand into strategic finance, treasury, FP&A, and eventually replace not just the back-office workflow but the judgment layer of the entire finance function. If FullSeam's agents evolve from executing rules to making financial decisions, you're looking at a company that could restructure how every mid-market CFO operates. The team has the operational DNA to pull this off -- they've built financial infrastructure at scale, they understand enterprise procurement, and they've demonstrated they can work together through adversity. The cross-platform agent architecture is structurally interesting because it creates a cannibalization problem for incumbents whose business models depend on platform lock-in. And the timing on LLM capabilities is genuinely favorable -- these models are improving on a steep curve. If I believed these founders would ride that curve into increasingly ambitious territory rather than settling into a comfortable SaaS business, I'd think differently. But nothing in the positioning -- "accounting teams don't need another dashboard, they need teammates" -- signals ambition beyond workflow automation.

These are experienced founders executing an experienced playbook in a market that experienced competitors already dominate. That sentence contains the word "experienced" three times, which is exactly the problem. I want founders who don't know what's impossible. I want outsiders who bring naivety and irreverence to a problem the industry has declared solved. What I see here is a team that knows the accounting automation market intimately and is building exactly what that market would predict. The consequence of that success, no matter how well executed, doesn't justify what these three people are capable of attempting.
