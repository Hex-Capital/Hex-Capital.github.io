# EigenPal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that hits me immediately with EigenPal is how perfectly it fits the mold of what every venture capitalist in San Francisco is looking for right now. AI document processing. Enterprise workflows. Large TAM with a hockey-stick growth projection. Two European bank customers. SOC II Type 2 certification. This checks every box that a consensus-driven investor would want checked -- and that's exactly why it doesn't light up for me. The IDP market already has Hyperscience with $439 million in funding, Rossum with $100 million and nearly $45 million in revenue, and ABBYY as the entrenched market leader adding LLM capabilities to their existing platform. When the incumbents are already building toward your differentiation, and every well-funded startup in your category is converging on the same "template-free LLM vision" approach, you're not in an unpopular space. You're in one of the most popular spaces in enterprise AI. The weirdness has been thoroughly arbitraged away.

I always start by asking founders to tell me their story -- not the business, but how they got to where they are and why this problem. With Jedr, I see a talented search infrastructure engineer from Elastic and Yelp. With Matej, I see a repeat B2B AI founder with an MIT degree and McKinsey on the resume. Both studied CS at Imperial College London. These are accomplished, credentialed people. But where's the thread? Where's the moment that made document processing the problem they couldn't walk away from? Matej's prior company, Assetario, was a revenue optimization platform for mobile apps -- a completely different domain. That doesn't suggest someone who's been orbiting this problem for years. It suggests someone who identified a market opportunity, which is a valid way to start a company but not the signal I invest on. When I backed the Contraline founder, it was because years of dedicated academic research had forged a biographical commitment to male contraception that no amount of investor rejection could break. I need to feel that the founder's story and the company's mission are inseparable, and I don't feel that here.

The strongest bull case is real and I want to be honest about it. Matej is a three-time founder who raised a $4M Series A for Assetario -- he knows how to build and sell B2B software. Landing two large European banks as pre-seed customers is genuinely impressive execution that most early-stage founders can't pull off. The SOC II Type 2 certification at this stage shows a team that understands enterprise buyers don't care about your demo until you've passed their security review. If the IDP market genuinely undergoes an architectural phase transition from template-based to LLM-native -- similar to how cloud-native databases displaced on-premise incumbents -- then the team that builds the best evaluation framework and workflow orchestration layer could capture enormous value. The "evaluation-first" approach, where you test against historical documents before deployment, is a smart product insight that could create real stickiness with risk-averse enterprise buyers. If I were a traditional enterprise SaaS investor, I'd be interested.

But I'm not a traditional enterprise SaaS investor. I'm also genuinely concerned about the co-founder dynamic. Matej is listed as CEO of Assetario from 2020 to present across multiple professional databases, alongside his role at EigenPal. I learned the hard way with HQ Trivia that founder alignment isn't something you can paper over with product quality. A co-founder who may be splitting attention between two companies -- especially when one of them raised $4M from institutional investors who presumably expect full-time commitment -- is the kind of unresolved dynamic I now probe aggressively before writing a check. I'd need to hear directly from both founders about how Assetario was wound down or handed off, and I'd need to believe the answer. Beyond that, a shared university background is nice but it doesn't tell me how these two handle disagreement when their runway is burning and the banks are dragging on procurement.

This company doesn't create economic access for people who lack it. It doesn't make an invisible system visible to those who need transparency. It makes large enterprises more efficient at processing their own documents. There's nothing wrong with that -- it's a real problem and a real business. But when I think about Uber creating income for drivers, or Affirm replacing hidden credit card fees with transparent interest rates, or Flock Safety bringing public safety data to communities -- those are companies that changed the structure of who has access to what. EigenPal optimizes back-office operations for billion-dollar banks. That's a fine business, but it's not the kind of investment that keeps me up at night imagining what the world looks like if it works.

I'm passing on this one. Competent team, real market, legitimate traction -- but it's a consensus bet in a crowded category with no biographical founder-problem fit and no signal that this company will be anything other than one of many well-funded IDP platforms competing for the same enterprise contracts. The best ideas I've backed never looked obvious at the start. This one looks obvious to everyone.
