# Fort -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is whether it possesses a secret -- an important truth about the world that most intelligent people actively reject. Fort's implicit thesis is that strength training is underserved by current wearables and needs a dedicated device. But this is not a secret. It is a trend line. WHOOP's own data shows strength workouts on their platform increased 122% year-over-year. Oura reports strength training as the third most popular activity among female members. Peter Attia has made resistance training a mainstream longevity protocol. GLP-1 drugs are driving millions toward muscle preservation. Every wearable company with a competent product team can read these charts. When WHOOP, Oura, Apple, and Garmin all see the same demand signal, what Fort calls an insight is actually a consensus observation dressed in startup language. The uncomfortable truth is that Fort has identified a problem that everyone already agrees exists -- which means there is no secret, and without a secret, there is no structural path to monopoly.

The competitive dynamics here are a textbook case of what Girard would recognize as mimetic convergence. Fort positions itself against WHOOP, Oura, Apple Watch, and Garmin -- companies with a combined billions in funding, tens of millions of active users, and engineering teams that outnumber Fort's entire company by orders of magnitude. WHOOP already has a wrist-worn band with IMU and optical heart rate sensors -- the same commodity components Fort uses. The memo itself acknowledges this: "The core technology -- IMU-based motion detection plus optical heart rate -- uses commodity sensor components." Adding strength-specific algorithms to WHOOP's existing platform is a software update, not a new company. The magnetic equipment-mount form factor is a clever design choice, but it is not a technological moat -- it is a product feature that any hardware team can replicate within a development cycle. When your differentiation depends on algorithmic accuracy trained on data, and your competitors already have millions of strength workout sessions in their databases, you are in a race you structurally cannot win.

The team deserves genuine respect. Three mechanical engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who have shipped physical products at scale -- 4680 battery cells, sensing systems for Semi, spacecraft subsystems at SpaceX -- this is not a software team cosplaying at hardware. They know manufacturing, they know sensors, they know the pain of atoms. But hardware competence and founder conviction are different things. I see no evidence of the kind of definite vision that distinguishes a monopoly builder from a capable product team. The early pivot from EMG sensors to heart-rate-and-motion is rational engineering, but it is also iterative behavior -- testing approaches rather than executing a singular plan with conviction. Miranda Nover's personal frustration with existing wearables is authentic founder-market fit in Paul Graham's framework, but in mine, the question is different: does this team see something about the future of human performance measurement that the entire wearable industry is structurally incapable of seeing? I find no evidence that they do.

The strongest bull case would require something like the following to be true: that auto-detecting exercises, measuring proximity to failure, and providing per-muscle-group breakdown at the wrist represents such a qualitative leap in the strength training experience that it creates genuine behavioral lock-in -- users build their entire training methodology around Fort's feedback loop, creating switching costs that compound over years. If Fort's dataset of exercise kinematics, paired with heart rate, produces a fatigue model that is genuinely predictive rather than merely descriptive, that could be a 10x improvement in training intelligence for serious lifters. The sub-$350 price point with a dedicated form factor could capture the serious strength athlete the way WHOOP captured the recovery-obsessed CrossFit athlete circa 2015 -- before WHOOP was consensus. In this scenario, Fort's small-market beachhead of dedicated strength athletes expands concentrically into general fitness. But this bull case requires Fort to build a data advantage faster than WHOOP can extend its existing one, which is the fundamental structural problem: your competitors have a head start on the very asset you need to win.

This is a "1 to n" company, not a "0 to 1" company. A better wearable for an underserved segment of an existing market is an improvement, not an invention. The next great wearable company will not be built by making a slightly better fitness band -- it will be built around a genuinely new capability that makes existing measurement paradigms obsolete. Perhaps continuous glucose monitoring integrated with training load. Perhaps non-invasive lactate threshold detection. Perhaps something we cannot yet imagine. What it will not be is an IMU and a heart rate sensor in a different form factor, competing for attention against companies with a thousand times more capital and data. I pass.
