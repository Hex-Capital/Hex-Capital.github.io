# Travo -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Travo is the dissonance between the team and the domain. Four Stanford CS undergraduates -- one with a background at Wachtell Lipton, one who wrote satellite code, one who engineered backend systems at Roblox -- have chosen to build a data aggregation platform for RV parks. None of them have documented experience in real estate, real estate finance, or commercial property data. This is not inherently disqualifying -- outsiders sometimes see what insiders cannot. But it raises the question that matters most: what do these founders know about the world that the people who have spent decades in commercial real estate data do not? I cannot find the answer. The implicit thesis -- "niche commercial asset classes lack centralized data, and AI can now collect it cheaply" -- is not a secret. It is an observation that everyone in the CRE data industry already agrees with. CoStar, Altus, Cherre, and Crexi all know that RV parks and marinas have worse data coverage than office buildings and multifamily. They have chosen not to serve those segments because the unit economics do not justify it relative to their core markets. Travo is not exploiting a truth the consensus rejects; it is filling a gap the consensus has consciously deprioritized.

The monopoly question is equally concerning. Where are the structural advantages that compound over time? Network effects require users to create value for other users -- a data subscription platform has none. Proprietary technology requires a 10x leap -- AI-powered web scraping and data aggregation are commodity capabilities that any competent engineering team can replicate. Economies of scale are limited by the niche market size. The only potential moat is the accumulated dataset itself: if Travo assembles, cleans, and structures RV park data comprehensively before anyone else decides to try, the cold-start cost of replication creates a temporal advantage. But temporal advantages are not monopolies. If institutional capital continues flowing into alternative asset classes and the market proves real, a well-funded incumbent -- Altus with its $200M+ in resources, Cherre with $105M -- can allocate a small team to build comparable coverage within a year or two. The structural barrier is business-model misalignment, which evaporates the moment the market becomes large enough to matter.

This is fundamentally a "1 to n" company. The CRE data platform model already exists -- CoStar perfected it decades ago. Travo is applying that existing model to an adjacent segment. The next great data company will not build another CoStar for a smaller property type. It will create an entirely new category of insight or decision-making capability that makes the current approach structurally obsolete. Nothing in Travo's description suggests that ambition. "Real Estate Data in Seconds" is a speed improvement on an existing workflow, not a reconceptualization of how real estate investment decisions are made.

The strongest bull case deserves serious engagement. If Travo executes flawlessly on RV parks, proves the playbook, and then expands horizontally across mobile home parks, self-storage facilities, marinas, car washes, and dozens of other fragmented alternative asset classes, it could become the default data layer for a growing institutional allocation to alternatives. The timing argument has some force: LLMs have genuinely reduced the cost of extracting structured data from unstructured county records and listing sites, and institutional capital is rotating into higher-yielding alternative assets as mainstream CRE compresses. In the best case, Travo builds a multi-vertical data platform that incumbents are structurally unwilling to replicate because each niche vertical is too small to justify their attention individually, but collectively they constitute a significant market. Chen's prior exit, while undocumented in detail, suggests at least some entrepreneurial capacity. This is a coherent story -- but it is a story about building a solid, defensible business, not about achieving the kind of power-law dominance that justifies an angel investment at this stage. Even in the optimistic scenario, each new vertical requires different data sources, different comp methodologies, and different domain knowledge. The expansion is additive, not multiplicative. There are no compounding returns to scale.

The power-law test is decisive. The U.S. RV park industry generates $10.9 billion in revenue. The addressable market for data services to investors in that segment is perhaps one-half of one percent of that figure -- maybe $50 million. Even expanding across all niche alternative asset classes, the total addressable market for specialized data subscriptions is constrained. This is not a company that can return a fund. It may become a profitable, useful business -- and there is nothing wrong with that -- but the mathematics of venture returns require the possibility of extreme outcomes, and that possibility is absent here. A data platform for niche real estate segments has a natural ceiling that no amount of execution can break through.
