# Tepali -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me start with the number that matters: $294 million. That's the global medspa management software market. Not the opportunity in five years -- the entire addressable market today. Even if you expand the aperture to the broader medical spa services market at $21 billion, and even if you imagine Tepali capturing not just software fees but a slice of every transaction flowing through medspas, the consequence of total victory here is building a competent vertical SaaS business in a sub-segment of healthcare. If Tepali wins -- wins completely, dominates every competitor, becomes the operating system for every medspa on earth -- nobody's life is fundamentally different. Scheduling gets smoother. Inventory tracking improves. Marketing attribution connects a few more dots. This is the kind of outcome I spend my career warning founders away from: you've aimed at a target so reasonable that hitting it doesn't justify the years of your life it will consume.

The competitive landscape makes this worse, not better. Boulevard raised $80 million in July 2025 specifically to push into medspas with AI features, citing the GLP-1 and Botox surge as their catalyst. Zenoti has $331 million in funding and $174 million in annual revenue serving enterprise wellness. AestheticsPro is already an established medspa-specific incumbent. Mangomint has $48-60 million and a loyal following. A two-person pre-seed team is not entering a market others have overlooked -- they're entering a market where well-capitalized players are actively converging on exactly their thesis. When Boulevard, a company with 5,000 customers and hundreds of millions in funding, publicly announces it's building AI-native medspa features, the contrarian signal disappears. The incumbents are not dismissing this market; they're racing into it. Compare this to Juniper, where Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. When incumbents mock your idea, you have a chance. When incumbents are doing your idea with 500 engineers and $80 million in fresh capital, you have a problem.

The strongest bull case I can construct is the Toast analogy -- that Tepali starts with software and expands into embedded payments, lending, and financial services for medspas, capturing a percentage of the $21 billion (growing to $78 billion by 2033) in medspa revenue flowing through the platform. Toast turned restaurant management software into a $30 billion public company by owning the financial layer. If Tepali executed this playbook in a market growing at 16% CAGR, with GLP-1-driven demand creating a new wave of medspa openings, the outcome could be meaningful. The "Fintech" tag on their YC profile hints at this direction. But Toast was attacking a $900 billion restaurant industry, not a $21 billion medspa market. And nothing in Tepali's public positioning -- their website, their feature set, their messaging -- articulates embedded finance as the core vision. They're leading with scheduling, CRM, and charting. If the fintech layer is the real play, it's invisible from the outside, which means either they haven't conceived it yet or they're not communicating it. Neither inspires confidence.

On the founding team: Chrisvin Jabamani has a solid but conventional background -- NYU Stern, PJT Partners investment banking, business operations at Rilla. The Rilla experience is relevant -- he's seen how vertical AI SaaS gets sold to fragmented SMB markets. His GitHub shows real engineering capability across mobile and AI tooling. But this is not the profile of an outsider attacking something the establishment considers impossible. This is a finance professional building operations software for a niche he appears to have identified analytically rather than lived inside. Neither founder has medspa domain experience -- no clinical background, no history running a medspa, no deep immersion in medical aesthetics. Normally I celebrate outsiders, but the outsider advantage requires attacking a problem at a scale where fresh eyes matter. An outsider building slightly better scheduling software doesn't gain the same leverage as an outsider reimagining meat production from molecular principles. The second co-founder, Vishnu Pathmanaban, is essentially a ghost in public records -- no LinkedIn details, no GitHub, no Twitter. For a two-person team where each founder's capabilities are existentially important, this opacity is a real gap in evaluating the bet.

The technology itself is consolidation, not disruption. Combining scheduling, CRM, charting, inventory, marketing analytics, and payroll into one platform with an AI query layer is useful engineering -- but every individual component exists as mature software. The dossier itself notes that "LLM-based query interfaces are becoming commoditized across vertical SaaS." There is no technology here that makes the incumbent approach structurally uneconomic. No 10x cost reduction. No fundamentally new capability. No physics breakthrough. This is a better-integrated version of tools that already exist, in a market where better-funded teams are building the same integration. I have spent forty years distinguishing between disruption and incremental improvement. This is incremental.

I pass. These founders are too capable to spend their best years fighting Boulevard's $80 million war chest for the right to manage medspa appointments. The problem isn't important enough, and the technology isn't radical enough. Go find a problem where the consequence of success reshapes how an industry operates -- where experts tell you it's impossible and you have a reason to believe they're wrong.
