# Unifold -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me about Unifold isn't the founders or the technology -- it's that this is already a validated, funded category. Glide came through YC two and a half years ago, raised a $15M Series A, and their CEO built the Robinhood Wallet. Fireblocks has a billion dollars. MoonPay -- the very company that acquired Timothy Chung's previous startup -- has $600M and literally bought Streambird to own this layer of the stack. When I look at a company, I'm asking whether it's unpopular and difficult to assess. Unifold is neither. Crypto infrastructure attracted $2.5 billion in a single quarter this year. Every serious VC knows multi-chain fragmentation is a problem. This is the opposite of what I hunt for -- this is consensus with a capital C.

Now, I want to be honest about the founders, because that's where I always start. Timothy Chung has a real exit -- he built Streambird and sold it to MoonPay. That's not nothing. Quang Huynh carries 15 years of fintech and crypto experience plus a prior acquisition. Hau Chu worked at Solana Labs and MoonPay with serious blockchain engineering chops. These are accomplished people who clearly understand the plumbing of crypto payments from the inside. But when I ask my fundamental question -- tell me your story, not the business -- what I hear is professionals who worked at a major crypto payments company, spotted an underserved product gap, and left to productize it. That's a rational career move, and honestly, for many investors, it's exactly what they want to see. But it's not the signal I run toward. I'm listening for the biographical thread that makes the problem personal, that makes the founder the only person who could solve it. I don't feel that here. These are operators executing on market insight, not outsiders driven by something they lived through.

The bull case deserves real engagement. If I set aside my framework and look at this purely as a business, there's a genuinely smart play buried in here. The team has literal institutional memory of how MoonPay works -- its gaps, its incentive structures, why it won't build a lightweight deposit SDK that cannibalizes its higher-margin products. That's real insider knowledge. The compliance-first approach with centralized exchange integrations is a wedge that Glide may not have prioritized. And the "why now" story is strong: stablecoin volumes are exploding, new L2s keep fragmenting the deposit experience, and YC itself is accepting stablecoin payments. If Unifold can lock in enough integrations fast enough, switching costs compound -- once you've routed millions of dollars of deposits through someone's infrastructure, you don't rip that out lightly. A world where Unifold becomes the Stripe of on-chain deposits is plausible, and in that world, the team's combined experience at MoonPay, Solana Labs, and Polymarket is the exact right background. For an investor who weights founder-market fit through professional credentials and execution velocity, this could be a strong bet.

But that's not how I invest. I don't feel the jolt. There's no moment where I imagine the full potential of this company and get that visceral excitement I had with Niantic or Crusoe. What I see instead is a well-credentialed team entering a crowded ring with a better-funded opponent who has a head start. The product is in private beta with no public traction metrics -- no transaction volumes, no revenue, no user counts. The product is listed at $0 with no visible monetization path. And the core technical components -- multi-chain address generation, transaction routing, gas abstraction -- are implementable by any well-resourced team. The defensibility story is prospective, not demonstrated. When I think about my Flock Safety investment, what made Garrett Langley special wasn't just that he was building surveillance infrastructure -- it was that he'd arrived at the insight through a path nobody else had walked, and he was building something that made an invisible system visible for communities that needed it. Unifold makes deposit routing invisible to end users, which is valuable engineering, but the beneficiaries are crypto-native developers and their already-crypto-savvy users. That's not the economic access story that lights me up.

The co-founder dynamics are fine on paper -- shared MoonPay history gives them a common language and work context. But I've learned the hard way that shared employment is a weaker bond than shared adversity. I don't see evidence of how this team navigates a crisis together. The Streambird acquisition was a success story, not a crucible. I'd want to understand what happens when chain integrations break at scale, when Glide undercuts them on pricing, when a major customer churns. These are the moments that test a founding team, and I have no data on how these three respond under that kind of pressure.

I respect what Unifold is building and I respect the team's credentials. In another investor's portfolio, this might be a smart bet on execution in a growing category. But I'm not looking for smart bets in growing categories. I'm looking for the misfits building things that make other investors uncomfortable, solving problems that come from somewhere deep in their own story. This one's not for me.
