# DroneTector -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The counter-drone market in 2026 is a Girardian disaster. Robin Radar, DroneShield, Dedrone, Fortem Technologies -- four well-funded companies with combined revenue exceeding $100 million, backed by defense primes and private equity, all pursuing the same customers with the same pitch: "drones are dangerous, we detect them." When I look at DroneTector, the first thing I see is not the technology or the team -- it is the competitive landscape. Four funded players, multiple sensor modalities, overlapping NATO and defense ministry customers, and a market thesis that could not be more consensus. Everyone watched the Ukraine footage. Everyone read the Gatwick headlines. "Drones are a threat" is not a secret -- it is on the cover of The Economist. When I backed Anduril, Palmer Luckey was creating a category that did not exist: venture-built autonomous defense hardware sold through Silicon Valley-speed iteration rather than Beltway procurement theater. DroneTector is not creating a category. It is entering one.

The question I must ask is whether DroneTector possesses a secret that redeems it from this competitive structure. The candidate secret is technical: 94 GHz millimeter-wave radar can detect nano drones that are invisible to lower-frequency systems. If this is true -- if there exists a class of threats that physically cannot be detected by Robin Radar's X-band systems or DroneShield's RF sensors -- then DroneTector owns a capability rather than a product improvement, and capability gaps in defense markets create enormous procurement urgency. The CEO's PhD research is directly on this question: micro-Doppler signatures of small UAVs at 94 GHz, published in IET Radar, Sonar & Navigation with experimental validation. This is not a marketing claim; it is peer-reviewed physics. But a technical specification choice is not the same as a contrarian truth about the world. Any radar engineer understands that shorter wavelengths resolve smaller targets. The trade-offs -- atmospheric attenuation at 94 GHz, reduced range, higher component costs, narrower beamwidth requiring more units for coverage -- are equally well understood. Robin Radar or Fortem could develop millimeter-wave capabilities if the market demanded it. DroneTector's "secret" is closer to an engineering optimization than to the kind of truth that most intelligent people actively reject.

The strongest bull case runs as follows: the drone threat is evolving faster than incumbents' architectures. Ukraine's progression from commercial quadcopters to FPV nano drones costing $50 represents a trajectory toward smaller, cheaper, more numerous threats. If the dominant threat in 2028 is a swarm of 50-gram drones, every existing counter-drone system -- optimized for DJI Mavic-class targets -- becomes structurally inadequate. DroneTector's millimeter-wave approach would then be not incrementally but categorically better, the only system that actually works against the threat that matters. NATO DIANA participation and DASA backing suggest the defense establishment is already hedging in this direction. And defense procurement creates formidable switching costs: once a radar system is qualified, integrated into command architectures, and operationally deployed, replacement is measured in years and millions. A small team that gets embedded early in NATO's nano-drone detection infrastructure could build the kind of integration moat that Palantir built with the intelligence community. If this scenario materializes, the three-PhD founding team -- with the CEO's research funded by QinetiQ and supervised within the UK's premier millimeter-wave radar group -- represents exactly the kind of deep technical founding that hard-technology monopolies require.

But I do not find this scenario sufficiently probable to overcome the structural concerns. The counter-drone market is not winner-take-all. Defense ministries deliberately diversify suppliers, maintain multiple qualified vendors, and resist single-source dependencies. This is the opposite of monopoly dynamics -- it is procurement-enforced competition. Robin Radar already has 200+ radars deployed in Ukraine and €43 million in revenue. DroneShield has $57.5 million in revenue with 70% from the US government. These are not paper competitors; they are scaled, deployed, revenue-generating businesses with established procurement relationships. A three-person team from Glasgow, regardless of PhD pedigree, faces a capital intensity problem that YC funding cannot solve: hardware manufacturing, defense certification, international export compliance, and 12-36 month procurement cycles that consume cash before generating revenue.

The founding team demonstrates genuine intellectual depth -- three PhDs across millimeter-wave physics, quantum technology, and automated reasoning, all Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Fellows. Dr. Moore's founder-market fit is among the tightest I have seen at pre-seed: his doctoral research is literally the company's core technology. But I see no evidence of the kind of definite vision that separates great founders from competent ones. What does the world look like when DroneTector wins? Is the plan to become a radar component supplier, a full-stack counter-drone system, a defense platform company? The CTO's concurrent involvement with Quantum Fabrix raises the question of whether this team has the singular commitment that hard-technology startups demand. And the absence of any revenue signal, customer commitment, or named LOI -- combined with the weight of incumbent competition -- means I am being asked to bet on a physics advantage in a market where physics is necessary but not sufficient.

I respect the technology and the team's credentials. In a different market structure -- one without four funded competitors generating tens of millions in revenue -- this would be a more interesting bet. But the counter-drone detection space looks to me like food delivery with radar arrays: multiple well-capitalized players chasing the same government customers with converging capabilities, in a procurement environment that structurally prevents monopoly. The secret is not secret enough, the monopoly path is not clear enough, and the competitive landscape is exactly what I have built my career avoiding.
