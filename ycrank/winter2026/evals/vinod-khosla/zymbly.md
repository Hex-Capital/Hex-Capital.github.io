# Zymbly -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a team of three Oliver Wyman aviation consultants who have built exactly the product their former clients would have asked them to build during a consulting engagement. That is the most important thing I notice about Zymbly, and it tells me almost everything I need to know. Robbie Bourke spent 25 years inside aviation — Head of Maintenance at Virgin Atlantic, lead engineer at Airbus, Partner at Oliver Wyman running their aviation practice. He knows what the industry considers possible. He knows what procurement committees will approve. He knows how to navigate FAA compliance. And that accumulated expertise has produced a company that sits politely on top of existing ERP systems, saves technicians time on paperwork, and asks nobody to change anything fundamental about how aircraft maintenance works. This is a consulting project dressed as a startup. The industry experience hasn't enabled invention — it has constrained ambition.

Let me apply my first question: if Zymbly succeeds completely, what changes? Aircraft technicians spend less time flipping through manuals and more time turning wrenches. MRO operations get somewhat more efficient. The company captures a sub-segment of a $7-10 billion MRO software market growing at 4.6% annually. That is a plausible business outcome — maybe a $500 million to $1 billion company at full potential. But nobody's life changes. No industry gets reorganized. Air travel doesn't become fundamentally safer or cheaper. The incumbent systems — Ramco, CAMP, Flatirons — continue operating exactly as before, with Zymbly as a productivity add-on. The company has explicitly chosen to supplement incumbents rather than replace them. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu didn't build a TCP/IP adapter for Cisco's routers — he built the router that made Cisco's architecture obsolete. The decision to be an overlay rather than a replacement is the decision to cap your own consequence of success.

The technology confirms this constraint. The dossier states it plainly: "The core technology — RAG over maintenance manuals, voice-to-text, and document generation — uses widely available AI building blocks. Other AI startups or legacy vendors could replicate the technical approach." CAMP Systems launched its own AI Operations Manager in October 2025. EmpowerMX shipped EMX Vision in 2023. The incumbents are already adding these capabilities to their installed bases. Zymbly is not building technology that makes existing approaches uneconomic — it is applying the same technology wave that every competitor in the space is also riding. There is no structural disruption here, only a race to implement commodity AI capabilities with better domain tuning. That is a competitive knife fight, not a technology moat.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: that the overlay strategy is a Trojan horse for eventually replacing the ERP systems entirely, that the 43,000-technician shortage by 2027 compresses enterprise sales cycles enough for a three-person team to build meaningful revenue before incumbents catch up, and that voice-first interaction in regulated environments creates sufficient switching costs to defend against CAMP and Ramco adding similar features. If all three prove true, Zymbly could become a significant MRO software company. The team is genuinely well-assembled for this specific problem — Bourke's operational experience, Jacob's applied AI background, Habibullah's ML engineering in regulated environments. Their design partnership with a major global airline is a real signal at pre-seed stage. The question isn't whether they can execute — it's whether successful execution produces a consequence worth the effort. Even in the bull case, you're building a workflow automation company in a mid-size vertical market. That's the kind of outcome I tell founders is too small for the talent they're deploying.

The timing is real — LLMs crossed the capability threshold for technical documentation queries in 2023-2024, and the labor shortage creates genuine buyer urgency. But this timing is now consensus. Everyone in aviation MRO software sees the same opportunity. Zymbly is not skating to where the puck will be — they're arriving at the same moment as every incumbent and every other startup in the space. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, nobody else was writing checks for AI. When I invested in cleantech in 2004, other VCs thought I was insane. The signal I look for is being early enough that experts dismiss the opportunity. Here, the experts are already building the same product.

I have to pass. These are smart people solving a real problem, and they may build a successful company. But I invest my own money in bets where the consequence of success justifies the risk of total loss — where getting it right reshapes how an industry operates. Zymbly has methodically eliminated risk until the remaining upside is, by my framework, insufficient. A better version of this company would be asking: what if AI didn't just help technicians do paperwork faster, but fundamentally changed how aircraft maintenance decisions are made — predictive enough to eliminate unscheduled maintenance entirely, autonomous enough to restructure the economics of the entire MRO industry? That would be a problem worth three careers.
