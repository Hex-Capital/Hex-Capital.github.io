# Robby -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about Robby is not the company itself — it's the competitive landscape surrounding it. Netic has raised $43 million at a $450 million valuation with 1,700% revenue growth, backed by Founders Fund and Greylock, attacking the same home services vertical with AI-driven revenue tools. Housecall Pro shipped "CSR AI" and "Coach AI" features in fall 2025. ServiceTitan just IPO'd at $8.45 billion with a war chest to build or acquire anything it wants. Arch has Coatue behind it doing AI outbound for the same customer base. When I see a pre-seed startup entering a space where incumbents are already validating the exact approach, where a competitor 100x their capitalization is growing 1,700% per year in the same vertical, and where the dominant platform can flip a switch and add this as a feature — that is not contrarian. That is consensus. And consensus timing in a market where the puck has already arrived is one of my clearest pass signals.

Let me apply my primary filter: if Robby succeeds beyond anyone's expectations, what changes? HVAC technicians arrive at jobs with better talking points. They close a few more upsells. Home service businesses extract perhaps 15-30% more revenue per truck roll. The industry itself continues to operate identically — technicians still drive to homes, still fix equipment, still invoice customers. The world is not different. The website claims "$135k additional revenue per technician per year," which is a perfectly fine SaaS ROI story and an utterly inconsequential outcome at the scale I care about. Nobody is disrupting a trillion-dollar system. Nobody is making an incumbent approach economically obsolete. This is a revenue optimization widget for a fragmented service industry. I would tell these founders the same thing I tell dozens of B2B SaaS teams every year: the probability of building a reasonable business here might be decent, but you have reduced risk to the point where the upside, even at its theoretical maximum, does not justify the talent in the room.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Home services is genuinely massive and tech-underserved. ServiceTitan's IPO proves the category supports enormous outcomes. The founders' domain immersion — riding along with dozens of technicians, shadowing every office role, pursuing EPA 608 certification — is a real signal of learning velocity, and 9+ named paying customers with testimonials claiming six figures in weekly revenue opportunities suggests they have found genuine product-market fit fast. Joe Schwarzmann's Bain work with PE-backed home services companies could unlock a distribution channel through roll-up platforms that is structurally difficult for competitors to access. If Robby evolves from a revenue optimization layer into the intelligence substrate that PE platforms use to operate entire portfolios of home service businesses, there is a path to a multi-billion-dollar outcome. The data flywheel — each technician visit enriching the AI — could compound. For the bull case to materialize, Robby would need to become indispensable to its customers before Netic, ServiceTitan, or Housecall Pro converge on the same feature set, and then leverage that position into something far larger than technician talking points. That is a narrow path through a competitive minefield, and the founding team has been in this market for months, not years.

What concerns me beyond the consequence magnitude is the founder profile. Three Harvard Business School graduates — one from Bain, two from elite engineering programs who worked at Uber, Amazon, Ironclad, and Porter — executing a market-validated playbook in a sector that institutional investors are already funding aggressively. These are not outsiders bringing irreverence to an industry that dismissed them. These are insiders who pivoted from a customs/imports AI startup when tariff policy shifted, evaluated multiple industries, and landed on home services because the market was attractive. That pivot sequence tells me they are searching for a problem to fit their ambition, not burning with conviction about a problem too important not to work on. The EPA 608 certification pursuit is admirable domain commitment, but it is the opposite of the signal I look for — an outsider who does not know what the industry considers impossible and therefore attempts it anyway. These founders know exactly what the industry considers possible, and they are building within those boundaries.

The technology itself — combining CRM data with third-party data to generate lead scores and talking points via LLMs — is technically reproducible, and the dossier acknowledges this directly. There is no structural technology moat here. No fundamental science breakthrough. No 10x cost disruption that makes the incumbent approach uneconomic. The core capability is an application layer that any well-funded competitor can replicate, and several are already doing so. When Housecall Pro can add your value proposition as a feature update to their existing platform that already owns the customer relationship and workflow data, you are not building a category-defining company. You are building a feature.

I pass. The founders are capable, the learning rate signal from their domain immersion is real, and the early traction is credible. But this is the archetype of what I warn against most: talented people who have optimized away every risk until the consequence of their success is a modest SaaS business in a crowded market, competing against players with 100x their capital for the privilege of helping HVAC companies close a few more upsells. The problem is not important enough, the technology is not disruptive enough, and the timing is not early enough. Go find something that terrifies you.
