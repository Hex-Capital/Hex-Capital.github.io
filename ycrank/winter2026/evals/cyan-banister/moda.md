# Moda -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Moda: this is one of the most consensus categories in venture capital right now. Braintrust just raised $80 million at an $800 million valuation. Arize has pulled in $131 million. Langfuse got acquired by ClickHouse. Datadog is already shipping LLM observability modules. When I look at the landscape around a company, I ask myself -- is this unpopular? Is it difficult to assess? The answer here is no on both counts. Everyone understands why AI agents need monitoring. Every fund in the Valley is writing checks into this space. The "Sentry for AI" framing is clever marketing, but it's a well-worn analogy that any investor can immediately pattern-match. That's the opposite of the signal I've learned to trust. The investments that changed my life -- SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe -- were the ones where people looked at me like I was out of my mind for even considering them. Nobody's looking at AI observability that way in 2026.

Now, Mohammed Al-Rasheed's story does have a thread I recognize. He built HookedIn.ca, a real-time crash alert platform for tow truck drivers, and got it to $125K monthly recurring revenue with 6,000 users across 28 cities before Ontario regulators effectively killed the tow truck operations it depended on. That's a real thing -- building something that working people relied on, getting it to meaningful scale, and then having the rug pulled by forces you can't control. I've lived that kind of loss in different forms, and it forges something in you. But here's what I keep coming back to: where's the biographical thread connecting Mohammed to AI agent monitoring? With Crusoe, the founders had arrived at this insight about waste gas and computation that was inseparable from who they were. With Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception -- you couldn't separate the person from the problem. Mohammed went from helping tow truck drivers to monitoring AI conversations. Pranav has relevant professional experience from Cerebral Valley doing LLM observability, which is valuable domain knowledge, but it's a resume line, not a life story. They pivoted to this idea after a previous YC application didn't work out. That pattern -- pivoting toward whatever's hot -- is exactly the category-chasing I try to avoid backing.

The strongest bull case I can construct is this: the timing is genuinely right. Multi-turn agentic workflows -- tool use, memory, planning -- create failure modes that legacy APM was never designed to catch. Behavioral anomalies like an agent claiming it made an API call it never made, or losing context mid-conversation, are real problems that cost companies trust and revenue. If Mohammed and Pranav can nail the developer experience and ride the YC network into early adoption, they could build switching costs through accumulated custom signals and institutional knowledge encoded in the platform. The two-line SDK integration is the kind of frictionless onboarding that Sentry itself used to build a massive developer franchise. And Mohammed has proven he can actually ship and scale product -- $125K MRR is not nothing. If I squint, I can see a world where behavioral failure detection becomes a distinct category from general LLM observability, and Moda owns it. But that "if I squint" feeling is very different from the jolt of energy I felt with Niantic or the conviction that hit me when I first understood what SpaceX was attempting. This feels like a reasonable bet, not an inevitable one.

What I don't see at all is the dimension I care about most after founder story: does this company create economic access or make invisible systems visible for people who need it? Moda helps engineering teams at companies that are already deploying AI agents. It makes AI failures visible to the engineers already building these systems. That's useful infrastructure, but it's not Uber creating income for drivers, or Affirm giving people transparent access to credit, or Flock Safety bringing public safety data to communities. The irony is that HookedIn.ca -- Mohammed's previous company -- actually did create economic access for tow truck operators. He moved away from that instinct when he moved into developer tooling. I also notice the brand disambiguation challenge -- multiple unrelated companies named Moda competing for the same search terms. That's a tactical headache, but it points to something deeper: in a crowded space, even your name has competition.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the strongest signal here for my framework. Mohammed and Pranav are Waterloo classmates who worked at Shopify together and have already survived a pivot. That shared history and the stress-test of abandoning one idea to pursue another tells me they can argue and resolve. After what I watched happen with HQ Trivia -- the right product at the right time destroyed by founders who couldn't get along -- I take this seriously. But solid co-founder alignment can't compensate for the fundamental mismatch between this company and what I look for in my portfolio.

I'm passing on Moda. The founders are competent, the market is real, and the product addresses a genuine need. But I invest my own money in things that are unpopular, difficult to assess, and deeply personal to the people building them. This is a well-understood category attracting enormous capital, built by founders who pivoted into it rather than being drawn by lived experience, in a market where five well-funded competitors and every major APM incumbent are converging on the same problem. I wish Mohammed had kept building for tow truck drivers.
