# Wideframe -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I see when I look at Wideframe: a genuinely competent founder who spent ten years running an agency that managed over a billion dollars in paid media for companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Adobe -- and then chose to shut it down rather than sell it or coast through a slow decline. Daniel Pearson walked away from Bamboo, a business he built over a decade serving 175+ brands, because he identified a problem he believed was more important to solve. That's a real decision with real personal cost. And Zachary Kim brings nearly twenty years of engineering, including neurosurgical R&D and a prior YC company (Float, S21), plus they worked together at Zaarly, so the co-founder relationship has a proven foundation. I respect all of that. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- tell me the story of how you got here, not the business -- what I'm hearing is a professional evolution, not the kind of biographical narrative that makes me believe this founder will walk through walls for this specific problem. Pearson saw inefficiency in his agency and built a tool to fix it. That's sound product thinking, but it's not the kind of forged-in-adversity conviction I've learned to bet on at the earliest stages.

The bigger issue for me is that this doesn't feel like an unpopular or difficult-to-assess company. AI applied to video workflows is one of the most crowded categories in startups right now. Descript has $55 million in ARR and $100 million raised. OpusClip just closed nearly $80 million. Runway has raised over $237 million. Every foundation model company is building video understanding capabilities. When I look at a space and see that many well-funded players and that much investor enthusiasm, I know the consensus has already formed. The "outside the NLE" positioning is clever -- acknowledging that 75% of the work happens before the editor opens is a smart observation -- but it's an incremental product insight, not the kind of idea that makes other investors uncomfortable. Nobody is going to tell Daniel Pearson he's crazy for building this. They're going to say "that makes total sense," and in my experience, when everyone says an idea makes sense, the pricing and competitive dynamics are going to be brutal. The most promising companies I've backed were the ones people told me were insane.

If I imagine the bull case -- what would have to be true for this to be a great investment -- it's that Pearson's decade of agency relationships gives Wideframe a distribution advantage that compounds faster than any competitor can replicate. Fifty brands and agencies in 75 days is real early traction, and if those are converting to paid subscriptions and expanding within agency networks through word of mouth, there could be a genuine land-and-expand motion here. The .prproj integration is a meaningful technical wedge -- reverse-engineering Adobe's proprietary format is non-trivial, and Adobe's incentive structure makes it unlikely they'd build a product that says "most of the work happens outside our software." If Wideframe becomes the default workflow layer around Premiere Pro, the switching costs from indexed video libraries could create real retention. That's a legitimate path. But it's a path built on execution speed in a competitive market, not on a structural insight that creates a durable moat. The underlying AI capabilities that power semantic video search are commoditizing rapidly.

What I notice that a typical analyst might not: this company doesn't create economic access for anyone who doesn't already have it. It saves time for video editors at agencies and brands -- people who are already employed, already skilled, already in the creative economy. Compare that to how Uber created income opportunities for hundreds of thousands of drivers, or how Affirm gave transparent credit access to people locked out of traditional lending. Wideframe is a productivity optimization tool, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't trigger the part of my thesis that gets me most excited -- the conviction that a company can create real-world impact for people who are currently excluded from economic opportunity. Saving an editor two hours a day is valuable to that editor and their employer, but it's not the kind of structural change I look for when I'm writing checks from my own money.

The co-founder dynamic is the one area where I feel genuine confidence. Pearson and Kim worked together at Zaarly before founding Wideframe, which means they've seen each other under pressure in a professional context. Kim's prior YC experience with Float means he understands the intensity of the program and what comes after. Their skills are clearly complementary -- agency operations and growth on one side, deep engineering and open-source credibility on the other. After what happened with HQ Trivia, I always probe this dimension carefully, and here the signals are positive. But strong co-founder alignment alone doesn't override my concerns about the category dynamics and the absence of the biographical depth and anti-consensus positioning I rely on.

I respect what Daniel and Zachary are building, and I think Wideframe will be a useful product for the agencies and brands that adopt it. But this is a consensus play in a hot market with well-funded incumbents, built by experienced operators solving a professional pain point rather than outsider founders driven by a deeper personal mission. That's not the profile that activates my conviction. I'm passing.
