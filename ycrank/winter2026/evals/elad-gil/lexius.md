# Lexius -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I look at with any company is the market's structural moment -- what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now? For AI-powered shoplifting detection, the inflection point was real: computer vision inference crossed a latency threshold enabling sub-2-second alerts on commodity camera hardware, and U.S. retail shrinkage accelerated post-COVID. But here's the problem -- that inflection happened two to three years ago, and the market has already responded. Veesion raised €53M in May 2025, operates in 5,000+ stores across 25 countries, and is explicitly opening a U.S. office. Everseen has $113M in funding serving enterprise retailers. Auror raised NZ$82M for adjacent retail crime intelligence. This is not a non-obvious market at a structural inflection. This is a well-understood, consensus-validated category with over $200M in aggregate competitor funding. When I invested in PagerDuty, operations alerting seemed boring and niche to every other investor -- that's why the opportunity existed. AI retail loss prevention in 2026 is the opposite pattern: the category is recognized, funded, and being actively contested by scaled players.

The competitive dynamics here are unfavorable in a specific way that matters. Veesion's 5,000+ store deployments generate a compounding data advantage -- each camera feed produces labeled behavioral training data that improves model accuracy across diverse store layouts, lighting conditions, and merchandise categories. Lexius has three documented deployments. In computer vision, training data volume directly determines accuracy and false-positive rates, and false positives in this domain aren't just annoying -- they create legal liability and discrimination risk for retailers. Veesion is entering the U.S. market with this data advantage at the exact moment Lexius is trying to establish itself. The dossier itself notes the barrier to entry is "moderate," which means Lexius faces pressure from both directions: well-funded incumbents scaling down to SMB, and new entrants using increasingly accessible ML frameworks to replicate the core approach.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is structurally limited. Shoplifting detection via existing cameras is a single-use-case tool. What's the second product you distribute through the retailer relationship? Inventory analytics? Customer traffic patterns? Checkout optimization? Each of those is a different capability, a different buyer within the retailer, and a different competitive set. Compare this to how Stripe's payment API became a distribution channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury -- each new product flowed naturally through the same developer integration. A camera-connected alerting tool doesn't create that kind of compounding distribution relationship. The retailer buys theft detection; there's no natural expansion vector that turns Lexius into infrastructure rather than a point solution.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: the U.S. SMB retail segment -- corner groceries, independent clothing stores, convenience chains -- is genuinely underserved. Veesion gets only 10% of its revenue from the U.S. without a local office, and Everseen targets enterprise. There are roughly 1 million retail establishments in the U.S., and the vast majority can't afford LP teams or enterprise video analytics contracts. If Lexius nails the self-serve, 15-minute remote installation model with a price point that works for a bodega owner, they could own the long tail before Veesion's U.S. expansion reaches that market segment. The FineFare case study -- 63% theft reduction, $3,520/month saved, 12x ROI at a Bronx grocery store -- is exactly the kind of proof point that resonates with SMB operators. And 4,000+ stores expressing interest without marketing spend suggests organic pull. If I squint, this is a "Gusto for retail loss prevention" play -- a boring, unglamorous product category where serving the long tail of small businesses creates a distribution base that eventually scales. But for that thesis to work, Lexius would need dramatically faster deployment velocity and a credible path to becoming a platform, not just a feature. Neither is evident yet.

The founding timeline raises execution questions. References to 2022 founding, a Dutch customer (Coop Vandaag), Slush 2023 attendance, and student entrepreneurship awards suggest this has been in development for roughly four years. Three documented deployments over that period -- even accounting for a pivot or geographic refocus -- doesn't signal the kind of weekly product velocity I look for. David Elskamp's track record running a profitable media agency from age 14 shows entrepreneurial instinct, and Liam Webster's AI and privacy research at Berkeley is directly relevant to the product's emphasis on non-biometric detection. These are capable founders for their stage. But the gap between a 4,000-store waitlist and three paying deployments suggests either a conversion problem or a sales velocity problem, and at a pre-seed stage against a competitor with €53M, that gap needs to close fast.

The single miracle here would be achieving best-in-class detection accuracy with a dramatically simpler deployment model than competitors -- proving that a 3-person team can deliver accuracy comparable to Veesion's 150-person operation through superior model architecture or training efficiency. That's a legitimate miracle, but it's being delivered in a market where a competitor has already demonstrated the solution works at scale. This is fundamentally different from Harvey's position, where the team was building ahead of a capability curve that hadn't yet arrived. Lexius is building behind a capability curve that competitors have already surfed. The structural moment isn't wrong -- it's late.
