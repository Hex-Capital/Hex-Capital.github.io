# Oxus -- Elad Gil Evaluation

SOX internal audit automation is the kind of market that triggers the right kind of dismissive reaction from most investors. Mandatory compliance work, tedious documentation, annual cycles -- it sounds boring. And my portfolio tells me that "boring but mandatory" is one of the most consistent patterns for building durable enterprise value. PagerDuty was "just alerting." Gusto was "just payroll." Checkr was "just background checks." Each one was infrastructure that every company needed, nobody wanted to build, and VCs yawned at. Oxus targets a similar pattern: every public company in America must comply with SOX, internal audit teams are the ones doing the work, and the current tools (AuditBoard, Workiva, spreadsheets) are workflow trackers, not AI-native automation for producing audit deliverables. That structural distinction matters.

But here's where the analysis gets complicated. Unlike Gusto, which addressed every employer in America, Oxus's initial addressable market is narrow -- approximately 4,000-5,000 US public companies plus some number of pre-IPO companies preparing for that transition. Each company has one internal audit department. That's a constrained initial wedge. Gusto could grow with every new business formed; PagerDuty expanded with every company that deployed software. Oxus grows primarily when new companies go public or when they expand into adjacent audit types (operational, IT, financial). The expansion path exists -- AuditBoard grew to $200M+ ARR and a $3B+ acquisition by broadening across GRC -- but it requires Oxus to evolve from a SOX automation tool into a broader audit platform. That's a distribution trajectory I'd rate as plausible but not organic in the way Stripe's developer API naturally channeled additional products.

The "why now" has two components, one strong and one shared. The strong component is the CPA talent shortage -- 75% of CPAs projected to retire in the next decade. That's a demographic time bomb creating structural demand for automation that isn't going to reverse. When supply contracts while regulatory burden stays constant, the economics of automation become mandatory, not optional. The shared component is LLM capability crossing the threshold for reliable document analysis and structured output generation. That's real, but it's a tailwind available to every competitor: Fieldguide ($125M raised, ~$700M valuation), Denki (YC-backed, audit-as-a-service model), and the incumbents themselves adding AI features. The structural moment exists, but it's not proprietary to Oxus.

The competitive picture is the dimension that gives me the most pause. Fieldguide has $125M in capital and relationships with half the Top 100 US accounting firms. They target external CPA firms today, but expanding into in-house audit teams is a natural adjacency -- it's the same domain expertise, similar workflows, and overlapping buyer networks. AuditBoard and Workiva have thousands of enterprise customers and will bolt AI features onto their existing platforms. The question is whether "good enough" AI from incumbents preempts the market for an AI-native entrant. I've seen this dynamic play out both ways: sometimes the incumbent's AI features are genuinely sufficient, and sometimes the architectural constraints of pre-AI platforms create a permanent quality gap. In audit specifically, where output accuracy has legal consequences, the quality gap could matter more than in lower-stakes workflows.

The bull case for Oxus runs through the Gusto analogy: a "boring" mandatory market where a modern, purpose-built tool replaces cobbled-together legacy infrastructure. If the CPA shortage accelerates as projected, enterprise audit teams won't have the luxury of waiting for AuditBoard to retrofit AI -- they'll need a tool that automates deliverable production now, not a workflow tracker with a chatbot. The internal audit vs. external audit segmentation could be a real market boundary, not just a positioning slide. In-house audit teams have different workflows, different organizational contexts, and different output requirements than external CPA firms. If Oxus captures the in-house segment before Fieldguide expands into it, annual audit cycles and embedded workflow integrations create meaningful switching costs. And AuditBoard's $3B+ exit demonstrates this market produces venture-scale outcomes.

Where I land: the founding team has relevant domain exposure -- Federal Reserve, D.E. Shaw, JPMorgan, BCG, ML engineering -- but these appear to be early-career positions, not deep operational experience in audit. Selling to Chief Audit Executives at Fortune 500 companies requires a level of domain credibility that internship-level financial services experience may not provide. I don't see evidence of prior exits or significant product launches, though YC acceptance and "onboarding early customers" suggests a working product exists. The team is credentialed for their stage but hasn't yet demonstrated the execution velocity that would override my competitive concerns. This is a real market at a real structural moment, with a team that has relevant but not exceptional domain depth, facing well-capitalized competitors -- exactly the profile where I need to see stronger early traction signals or a clearer distribution moat before writing a check.
