# CellType -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

David van Dijk didn't enter computational biology. He built the tools that define it. MAGIC and PHATE aren't papers on his CV -- they're methods that thousands of researchers use daily to analyze single-cell data, cited nearly nine thousand times. When someone invents the instrumentation that an entire field relies on, that's not domain expertise. That's specific knowledge in its purest form -- accumulated through years of obsessive work at the intersection of computer science and cellular biology, impossible to replicate through any training program or six-month deep dive. The Cell2Sentence insight -- that you can serialize gene expression profiles into ordered sequences of gene names and let language models reason about cellular states -- is the kind of cross-domain bridge that only emerges when someone understands both sides deeply enough to see the connection nobody else sees. A smart ML engineer wouldn't think of it because they don't understand single-cell biology at the methodological level. A biologist wouldn't think of it because they don't understand how LLMs process sequential information. Van Dijk lives at that intersection. He turned down Google and is walking away from an academic career validated by an NSF CAREER Award in 2025. That's a costly signal -- tenure-track professors don't leave Yale for startups they aren't certain about.

The leverage architecture here is what catches my attention beyond the founder. CellType isn't really a drug company. It's building biological simulation infrastructure -- a "virtual human" that pharma companies can query before running physical experiments. This maps directly to my infrastructure thesis: one simulation platform serving the entire pharmaceutical industry is picks-and-shovels at the deepest level. If the virtual human works, every drug program benefits from it, the way every blockchain developer benefits from Alchemy regardless of which chain they're building on. The 100% inbound signal from Top 10 pharma suggests the market is pulling them toward this infrastructure role rather than the founders pushing a product. That said, the business model remains ambiguous -- pharma partnerships can devolve into consulting relationships that scale linearly with headcount. The difference between "platform that simulates biology" and "team that runs simulations for pharma clients" is the difference between leverage and labor. I don't have enough evidence to know which side CellType lands on yet.

The contrarian angle is more nuanced than it first appears. AI drug discovery as a category is pure consensus -- Isomorphic has $600M, Recursion merged with Exscientia, Insilico IPO'd, Valo signed multi-billion dollar deals. Betting on "AI for drugs" in 2026 is like betting on "mobile apps" in 2012. But CellType's specific approach -- using LLMs to reason about cellular biology through a language-based representation of gene expression -- is genuinely non-consensus. Most competitors work at the molecular structure level (protein folding) or phenotypic imaging level. Nobody else is treating the cell as a text document. The question is whether this representation is fundamentally more powerful or just differently shaped. The ICML publication and DeepMind collaboration provide credibility but not proof. If the cellular-level approach captures biological information that molecular and imaging approaches miss, CellType has a decade-long head start. If it doesn't, they've built an elaborate encoding that adds complexity without predictive power.

The Google DeepMind relationship is both CellType's strongest credibility signal and its most dangerous structural risk. DeepMind chose to co-develop C2S-Scale with van Dijk's lab -- that's validation from arguably the world's best AI research organization. Sundar Pichai personally amplified the research. But Isomorphic Labs sits inside the same corporate structure with $600M and direct access to DeepMind's compute and talent. Building your core model on Google's Gemma architecture, co-developed with Google's researchers, while Google's own drug discovery subsidiary operates in adjacent space -- this is building leverage on someone else's platform. The parallel to my crypto investments is instructive: I backed protocols that owned their own infrastructure layer, not applications built on infrastructure they didn't control. CellType's defensibility must come from layers above the foundation model -- the agentic orchestration, the proprietary validation data, the pharma relationships -- and there's limited public evidence that these layers are mature.

The open-source leakage compounds this concern. Cell2Sentence is published. The code has 809 stars on GitHub. The 27B model is on Hugging Face. The specific knowledge that created this methodology lives in van Dijk's head, but the methodology itself is now public. This is the inverse of how compounding technology should work -- normally each iteration makes replication harder. Here, each publication makes replication easier. The counter-argument is that open-source builds reputation and inbound demand, which it clearly has. But reputation is not a moat. The moat has to be the unpublished layers: the agentic pipeline, the pharma-specific fine-tuning, the validation datasets. These are real but unproven.

I'd invest, primarily on the strength of van Dijk's specific knowledge and the infrastructure-level nature of what they're building. The founder created the field's core tools, conceived a genuinely novel bridge between biology and LLMs, and has early validation from DeepMind and Top 10 pharma. Ivan Vrkic satisfies my technical co-founder requirement with CERN engineering and biotech foundation model experience. The risk profile is real -- Google dependency, open-source exposure, academic-to-commercial transition -- but these are the kinds of risks that come with deep-science bets. When I invested in Extropic, thermodynamic computing was at least as speculative as cellular language models. The specific knowledge bar is met at a level I rarely see. What I want to verify before writing the check: the structure of existing pharma relationships (platform licensing vs. consulting), any IP arrangements with Yale and Google, and whether van Dijk has a plan for the commercial leadership gap. But the raw ingredients -- non-teachable knowledge, infrastructure leverage potential, and a founding insight that can't be replicated by throwing money at it -- those are present.
