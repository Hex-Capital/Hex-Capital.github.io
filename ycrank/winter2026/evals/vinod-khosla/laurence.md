# Laurence -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here are two former Jump Trading quants who understand stochastic optimization at a level most founders never approach — and they've pointed all of that firepower at making Amazon sellers pay a few cents less per click. That talent-to-ambition mismatch is the central fact of this company. Leo Gierhake is a professional poker player with $250K in winnings and a Jump Trading researcher. Matthew Chen built data science agents at Google and grew Facebook retention by 18%. These are people who think natively in expected value, confidence intervals, and decision-making under irreducible uncertainty. I take the quantitative trading analogy seriously — treating each bid as a position under stochastic outcomes is genuinely how you should think about this problem. But then I ask: if they succeed completely, if their RL system dominates Amazon PPC optimization and they capture a large share of this tools market — what changes? Amazon sellers' margins improve by 15-40%. That is the entire consequence. No industry transforms. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The physical world is unchanged.

I invest where the consequence of success justifies the career commitment of brilliant people. Amazon generated $56 billion in advertising revenue in 2024 — impressive topline, but Laurence sits on top of that number as an optimizer, not a disruptor. The tools layer of this market is demonstrated by incumbents: Pacvue at $50M revenue, Teikametrics at $45M, Quartile managing $2B in ad spend. Those are the ceiling markers. Even if Laurence captures the entire optimization layer, it's a mid-scale ad-tech SaaS outcome. When I backed Square, mobile payments didn't optimize the existing POS system — they replaced the infrastructure entirely. When I backed Juniper, TCP/IP routing didn't make Cisco's legacy architecture 30% more efficient — it made it structurally obsolete. Laurence makes Amazon's existing advertising system work somewhat better for the people paying into it. That's the difference between disruption and optimization, and I only invest in disruption.

The technology argument deserves honest engagement. Reinforcement learning applied to high-dimensional bid spaces with confidence-weighted signal borrowing is technically elegant, and the quant trading methodology is the right paradigm for this problem. The hourly optimization cadence versus competitors' daily or weekly adjustments is a real operational advantage today. But the underlying techniques — RL, transformers, stochastic optimization — are well-documented and broadly accessible. Pacvue has $476M in total funding. Teikametrics has $65M. When these incumbents decide to hire a few quantitative researchers (and they will, once Laurence demonstrates the approach works), the organizational inertia barrier dissolves. There is no physics-based moat here, no regulatory barrier, no network effect that compounds structurally. The defensibility is execution speed and accumulated training data — real but temporary advantages in a market where incumbents have both the capital and the distribution to respond.

The bull case that would change my mind requires believing three things simultaneously: that the RL approach creates performance separation so dramatic that it becomes winner-take-all in Amazon ad optimization, that this advantage extends across advertising platforms (Walmart, Meta, Google) creating a universal optimization layer worth tens of billions, and that the quant trading methodology produces compounding returns from data accumulation that incumbents genuinely cannot replicate. If all three hold, you could argue Laurence becomes the "Renaissance Technologies of digital advertising" — and that would be a consequence worth investing in. But that requires the advertising bid optimization market to behave like financial markets, where millisecond advantages compound into billions. The evidence suggests otherwise: advertising markets have slower feedback loops, noisier signals, and lower stakes per decision than financial markets. The technique transfers, but the magnitude of advantage may not.

What I would tell Matthew and Leo: you are too talented to spend your careers making Amazon PPC 40% more efficient. The same stochastic optimization skills applied to drug discovery, energy grid optimization, or autonomous systems would produce a consequence of success that matches your capability. You've demonstrated you can build production RL systems that outperform rule-based approaches under real-world conditions — that proof of concept has value far beyond Amazon advertising. Go find a problem where the consequence of your technology succeeding changes how an industry operates, not just how much it costs.
