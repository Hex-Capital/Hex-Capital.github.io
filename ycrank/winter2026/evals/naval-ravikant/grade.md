# Grade -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The thing that strikes me first about Grade is not the founders or the market — it's the leverage architecture, or rather the absence of one. Grade processes payments from companies to creators. Every dollar that flows through the platform requires actual money movement on commoditized rails — Stripe, Wise, the usual infrastructure. The software layer on top (performance tracking, tax compliance, bulk approvals) adds operational convenience, but it doesn't create a new category of capability. A brand using Grade can pay creators faster. That's efficiency. It's not leverage. Compare this to what Replit does for coding or what AngelList did for fundraising — tools that enabled a fundamentally new type of person to do a fundamentally new type of work. Grade enables the same people to do the same work with fewer spreadsheets. That's a real business, but it's not the kind of nonlinear output-per-input ratio that I look for.

The specific knowledge question is more interesting. Lotanna built XPO — a creator payments fintech — raised over a million for it, then built Creator Check for creator screening, and now Grade for creator payroll. James was CTO at Creator Check and has a strong shipping record (Pray Screen to $40K MRR in two months, crypto startup exit at 22). These two have been circling the brand-creator payment problem for three years together, approaching it from different angles each time. That's not generic entrepreneurship — it's genuine iteration toward a specific understanding. Lotanna knows which workflows break when a brand tries to pay 400 creators across 15 countries with variable compensation tied to TikTok views. That knowledge was earned through operational exposure, not classroom instruction.

But I keep asking myself: is this knowledge that a smart generalist couldn't acquire in six months of customer interviews? The brand-creator payment workflow is operationally complex — tax forms, multi-jurisdiction compliance, performance metric integration — but conceptually transparent. It's plumbing. When I backed Twitter, Williams understood something about human communication that couldn't be reverse-engineered. When I looked at Notion, Zhao had a theory about the relationship between tools and thought that went beyond product management. Grade's founders understand a workflow problem deeply. That's valuable, but it doesn't represent the kind of insight that reshapes how you think about a category.

The timing concern is straightforward. Creator payments is a defined, funded market segment — $3.08 billion projected, four named competitors with $40M+ in combined funding (Lumanu, Stir, MONET), and Tipalti at $200M+ ARR capable of adding performance-pay features whenever the market justifies it. Nobody smart is dismissing this category. That means the pricing already reflects the opportunity, and the asymmetric upside I need — the hundred-to-one return — requires Grade to win a competitive race against better-funded players on execution and vertical depth alone. I've seen that movie. The vertical specialist sometimes wins, but it's a grind, not a leverage play.

The strongest bull case: the shift from flat-fee influencer sponsorships to performance-based compensation (cost-per-view, affiliate, hybrid) creates a workflow complexity step-function that genuinely doesn't exist in horizontal AP tools. If Grade nails this narrow workflow and becomes the default rails for performance-based creator pay, the 120% month-over-month payout growth ($380K in the last 30 days) compounds into meaningful volume. The tax compliance records across 190 countries create real switching costs — re-collecting W-8BEN forms from hundreds of international creators is a genuine migration barrier. And the founders' repeated iterations in this space mean they won't be surprised by the operational edge cases that trip up new entrants. If the creator economy's shift to performance pay is as structural as the shift from print to digital advertising, Grade could become essential infrastructure. That's a legitimate outcome path. But it requires winning a competitive market through operational excellence rather than leverage or compounding technology — and that's not where I get my best returns.

The technology itself doesn't compound in a way that excites me. The dossier notes that "a new entrant with payments API access could replicate the basic product within months." The defensibility is operational (compliance records, creator onboarding data), not technical. Stack Overflow built a knowledge graph that became more valuable with every question. Alchemy built an API layer where developer dependency deepened over time. Grade builds a compliance database that grows linearly with creator count. It's sticky, not compounding.

Competent founders, real domain experience, genuine traction signals. But this is vertical payment infrastructure in a consensus market with well-funded competition, built on commoditized rails, without the leverage architecture or compounding technology that defines my best investments. The founders are building a useful tool, not an engine of disproportionate output.
