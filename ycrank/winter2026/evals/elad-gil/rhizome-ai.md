# Rhizome AI -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I check when a startup claims to be disrupting an incumbent is whether the incumbent has already moved. Clarivate's Cortellis serves 100% of top-20 pharma companies and has already shipped an AI-powered Regulatory Assistant with conversational capabilities. That's not a sleeping giant -- that's an incumbent executing an AI feature roadmap on top of entrenched enterprise relationships. The structural question for Rhizome isn't whether AI-powered regulatory Q&A is valuable. It obviously is. The question is whether Q&A represents a genuine product category shift that requires a new company, or a feature that the existing vendor distributes to its installed base at zero incremental acquisition cost. When Stripe launched, PayPal couldn't respond because the entire developer-first API paradigm was architecturally alien to PayPal's checkout-button model. I need to see an equivalent structural mismatch between Clarivate's architecture and what Rhizome is building, and I'm not convinced it exists. Clarivate's change-tracking dashboard model is different from open-ended Q&A, but not incompatibly different -- layering a Q&A interface on top of structured regulatory databases is a product sprint, not a ground-up rebuild.

Regulatory affairs intelligence does fit my "boring but critical" archetype well. Every company that brings a drug or device to market needs regulatory intelligence, the workflows are built on repetitive, highly paid manual research, and most software investors dismiss it as too niche or too regulated. That's the PagerDuty and Gusto pattern -- markets that seem small and unglamorous but turn out to be universal. The $9.5 billion TAM is real. But when I apply my structural inflection test -- what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now? -- the answer is generic: LLMs and RAG systems crossed an accuracy threshold for professional use. That same answer applies to legal AI, compliance AI, medical AI, and every other vertical Q&A play. There's no market-specific inflection point unique to regulatory affairs. The FDA's January 2025 draft guidance on AI in drug approval is tangentially relevant but addresses AI-discovered compounds, not AI tools for regulatory teams. I'm looking for a "why now" that is specific to this market, and I don't find one that separates it from the broader vertical AI wave.

The strongest bull case is worth articulating. If Rhizome's Q&A tool becomes the entry point to a full regulatory workflow platform -- question answering today, submission assembly tomorrow, change management and compliance tracking next year -- then this is a wedge product with genuine product-to-distribution potential. Regulatory affairs professionals who trust Rhizome for research would be natural customers for adjacent tools. The pricing structure (from $400/month self-serve to custom enterprise) enables a land-and-expand motion, and the market has clear adjacent workflows to absorb. If the quality gap between Rhizome's purpose-built system and Clarivate's bolted-on AI assistant is wide enough and persistent enough, the wedge could work. Pharma companies that experience a step-function improvement in research speed will expand usage. And the founder's Instabase background -- employee #16 at a company that processes documents at scale for regulated industries -- is directly relevant to building this kind of system. The EvolutionaryScale experience gave him exposure to the life sciences AI ecosystem where he identified that the regulatory intelligence layer was underserved. That's a real insight born from domain proximity, not a pivot-into-hot-sector play.

What gives me genuine respect for Chetan Mishra is the execution velocity. Six figures in revenue during 2025, 20+ customers, a 2.5TB corpus across 30 datasets and 6 markets -- all built by a single person selling into one of the slowest-moving enterprise buyer categories in technology. That's not a wrapper. That's someone who has done the hard work of data curation, retrieval tuning, and enterprise trust-building in a market where accuracy literally affects drug approvals. The zero hallucination claim across 2,800+ questions is either a meaningful quality signal or an untested claim at low volume -- but even the aspiration signals that the founder understands what regulatory professionals actually need. His progression from IBM ML to Instabase tech lead (closing $7M in deals) to EvolutionaryScale founding engineer demonstrates both technical depth and the ability to ship product that scales.

But the defensibility question nags. The underlying data sources are entirely public. The core technology is general-purpose LLMs and RAG, both of which are commoditizing rapidly. The moat is domain-specific data curation and retrieval tuning for regulatory language -- real work, but replicable work. A well-funded competitor with regulatory domain expertise could build a comparable system in months, not years. This isn't the structural moat I see in regulated markets like defense procurement (Anduril) or financial services (Coinbase), where compliance barriers take years to clear. The regulatory complexity here is in the customer's market, not in the product's market. And the solo founder constraint is real for enterprise pharma sales. You need dedicated customer success, domain-expert sales engineers, and a compliance and security posture that scales with customer count. At 20+ customers it works. At 200, the bandwidth math breaks.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is where my uncertainty concentrates. If regulatory Q&A is the beginning of a platform that captures the entire regulatory affairs workflow, this is a 10x company. If Q&A is the product -- a tool that answers questions and stops there -- it's a feature that Clarivate subsumes or that gets squeezed by general-purpose LLM improvements. The dossier shows no evidence that the founder has articulated a multi-product vision, though the market structure clearly permits one. I'd want to hear Chetan describe how Rhizome Ask becomes the distribution channel for Rhizome's second and third products before I'd invest. Without that conversation, I see a competent founder building a real product in a market that fits my pattern, but without the structural asymmetry that separates a good company from a generational one.
