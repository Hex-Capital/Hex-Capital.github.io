# Sonarly -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Sonarly is how legible it is. AI-powered alert triage for dev teams — everyone can see this opportunity. PagerDuty is a public company doing half a billion in ARR. incident.io just raised $62 million at a $400 million valuation. BigPanda has taken $340 million. Keep raised a pre-seed last year for essentially open-source AIOps. And on Hacker News, someone in the comments described building this exact workflow with GitHub Actions and Claude, getting 30% of auto-generated PRs to a mergeable state. When a commenter on your Launch HN thread can describe replicating your core value proposition with off-the-shelf tools, that's a signal I pay close attention to — and not a good one. The most promising companies I've backed were ones that most people couldn't even assess, let alone replicate in an afternoon. This space is the opposite of that. It's consensus. It's obvious. And when something is obvious and well-funded incumbents are already building it, the early-stage investor is buying the most expensive lottery ticket in the room.

I always want to hear the founder's story before the business, and here the dossier gives me something but not enough. Dimittri and Alexandre were students at CY Tech in France, they built Meoria — a career guidance app for French high school students navigating Parcoursup — and scaled it to 100,000 users in seven months. That's real. Getting 100K users on anything when you're a student shows you can execute and you understand distribution. They dropped out to pursue Sonarly, which shows conviction. But the connection between their biography and this problem is thin: they got too many alerts while running Meoria. That's a developer inconvenience, not a forge. When I backed SpaceX, Elon wasn't just annoyed by expensive rockets — the entire arc of his life pointed toward making humanity multi-planetary. When I invested in Uber, it wasn't because Travis had a bad taxi experience once — it was years of my husband and me discussing the medallion system as a structural injustice. I need the founder's life to be inseparable from the mission. Here, the founders experienced a workflow pain point that every engineering team experiences. That's relatable, but it doesn't tell me they'll persist through the kind of crisis that destroys most startups.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Atlassian sunsetting OpsGenie by April 2027 creates a genuine switching moment — thousands of engineering teams will need to migrate their alerting stack, and a nimble startup could capture some of that displacement. The "internal map of the production system" concept is interesting as a potential data moat — if Sonarly accumulates enough context about each customer's architecture and failure patterns, switching costs could compound over time. And the founders clearly can build and ship: 100K users on Meoria, a working product launched on HN, accepted into YC with Jared Friedman as partner. If I squint, I can see a path where the triage quality (deduplication, RCA regrouping, false positive filtering) becomes genuinely best-in-class and creates the kind of sticky data asset that makes customers reluctant to switch. If Sonarly could reduce 180 daily alerts to 5 actionable ones as claimed, and if the auto-generated fixes had a high acceptance rate, that would be transformative for on-call engineers. But that's a lot of "ifs," and every one of those "ifs" is being pursued simultaneously by companies with orders of magnitude more resources and existing customer relationships.

What I don't see here is what I'd need to write a check from my own money. There's no economic access story — this serves well-compensated software engineers, not people who lack access to opportunity. There's no regulatory complexity creating a moat — this is standard SaaS with API integrations. There's nothing stigmatized or dismissed about the category — it's AI developer tools, which is the single hottest investment theme in venture right now. The founders aren't solving a problem rooted in lived adversity. The idea isn't weird or unpopular — it's the kind of thing that shows up in every investor's inbox. I invest in things that make people uncomfortable because they seem crazy. Sonarly makes people comfortable because it seems obvious. That's exactly the wrong signal for me.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the one dimension where I feel some warmth. These two built a company together before, at CY Tech, and took it to real scale. They share an educational background and have navigated the stress of a prior venture. That's meaningful — I've learned the hard way with HQ Trivia that even a perfect product can't survive co-founder misalignment, and these two have at least been tested together once. It's not enough to overcome everything else, but I want to note what's genuinely positive.

I'm passing. These are capable young builders in a real market, and I wouldn't be surprised if they build a solid business. But nothing about Sonarly activates the pattern recognition that's driven my best investments. It's popular when I want unpopular. It's legible when I want hard to assess. It serves the well-served rather than creating access for those who lack it. And the founders, while clearly talented, haven't shown me the kind of biographical depth that tells me they'll walk through fire for this specific problem. I wish them well — but this isn't my kind of bet.
