# Voltair -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Voltair is the multi-miracle problem. Safely clamping a drone onto a live high-voltage transmission line and harvesting energy from it is a genuine technical breakthrough -- and it's clearly the team's one identified miracle. But when I map the full path from here to a large business, I count at least three more: FAA BVLOS authorization at national scale, penetrating utility procurement cycles that run 12-24 months, and raising the capital to deploy a physical network of charging pads across the U.S. grid. Each of these is individually achievable, but sequenced together they compound low-probability events in exactly the way I've learned to avoid. The team that built Harvey had a single miracle too -- model fidelity for legal work -- but that miracle was being delivered by someone else (OpenAI), so Harvey could focus entirely on workflow and distribution. Voltair has to deliver its own miracle AND clear three external gates.

The structural moment in utility wildfire liability is real, and it's the strongest thing this company has going for it. PG&E's bankruptcy from the Camp Fire, the 2025 Palisades disaster, the escalating uninsurability of utility grids in fire-prone regions -- these create a genuine "why now" that didn't exist at this intensity five years ago. When I see a manual inspection cycle of 5-11 years being compressed to 60 days, that's not incremental improvement, that's a 30-60x step function. Utilities facing existential liability will pay for that. But here's what keeps this out of my highest-conviction zone: the drone inspection market is not non-obvious. Skydio has raised $715M+ and serves 60+ utilities. Percepto has $120M+ and Fortune 500 utility clients. This is a well-funded, well-understood market with established players -- the opposite of PagerDuty when I invested, where nobody thought operations alerting was a real category. The specific angle of continuous autonomous monitoring via line-charging is differentiated, but the buyer, the use case, and the competitive set are all well-mapped by other investors.

What concerns me most from my framework is that this is fundamentally a hardware company with thin software wrapping. They position as "a drone data provider," which is the right strategic framing, but the moat today is a physical clamp mechanism and patent-pending hardware. When I evaluate whether a company is software-driven or software-aware, I ask: could you remove the software and the business would still basically work? Voltair's answer is uncomfortably close to yes -- the value is in the drone and the charging mechanism, not in software that compounds. Over time, a longitudinal inspection dataset and AI-based defect detection could build a software moat, but that's a future state requiring additional execution, not a current reality. Compare this to Samsara, which also started in physical infrastructure (IoT sensors for fleet management) but whose entire value proposition was the data platform from day one. Voltair could get there, but it needs to.

The bull case is worth spelling out because it's genuinely compelling. If the self-charging mechanism proves reliable at production scale -- across varying line voltages, weather conditions, and safety certifications -- it represents a structural hardware moat that would require competitors like Skydio to fundamentally redesign their platforms. That's not a software feature they can ship in a quarter; it's years of hardware R&D, safety testing, and regulatory approval. Combined with the urgency of wildfire liability and the massive gap between current inspection frequency and what utilities need, Voltair could become the infrastructure layer for autonomous grid monitoring the way PagerDuty became the infrastructure layer for operations alerting. The CTO's two years at Seattle City Light doing system protection engineering gives the team genuine domain credibility with utility buyers. And the land-and-expand thesis into rail, road, and telecom infrastructure creates the kind of adjacency expansion that turns a vertical tool into a platform. If Voltair can reduce their miracle count to one -- if FAA BVLOS authorization continues its current trajectory of progressive easing, and if they can fund the infrastructure deployment through a service model that doesn't require raising $200M upfront -- then the self-charging mechanism alone becomes the single miracle, and the company looks much more interesting.

Where the founders impress me is execution velocity relative to their constraints. Six flying prototypes, approximately 2,000 poles inspected, validated core charging technology, and winning $45K across multiple university competitions -- all before graduating. Nopp declining SpaceX to pursue this full-time is a conviction signal I weight. The team composition is smart: Gosch brings utility domain expertise from Seattle City Light and SEL, Gotskind brings aerospace government affairs experience from Virgin Galactic and Amazon Kuiper (directly relevant for FAA navigation), and Weissbluth has startup operations and SBIR grant experience. For a team of recent graduates, they've assembled complementary skills with unusual precision. But I've seen enough young teams to know that university competitions and prototype builds test a fundamentally different muscle than enterprise utility procurement, safety certification, and 18-month sales cycles.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is the dimension where my conviction stays moderate. The initial product -- autonomous drone inspection data for power utilities -- doesn't naturally become a distribution channel for additional products through the same integration point the way Stripe's payment API distributed Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Expansion into rail, road, and telecom is customer segment expansion, not product expansion through an embedded distribution channel. The data layer could become a platform -- if they accumulate enough longitudinal inspection data to offer predictive maintenance, vegetation management analytics, or risk scoring that utilities couldn't get elsewhere -- but that requires both time and scale they don't yet have.

I respect the structural moment and the technical ambition, but the multi-miracle path, capital intensity, well-funded competitive landscape, and hardware-centric moat put this outside my highest-conviction zone. I'd track the company closely through their utility pilot results and FAA engagement, and I'd reconsider if they can demonstrate the charging mechanism's reliability at production scale and secure a meaningful utility contract -- those signals would collapse the miracle count in a way that changes the math.
