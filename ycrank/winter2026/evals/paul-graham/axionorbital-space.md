# AxionOrbital Space -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that jumps out about AxionOrbital isn't the technology or the team — it's the timeline. Five months ago this company was a no-code IDE for geospatial data. Now it's a foundation model for SAR-to-optical translation. Those are different companies. The GitHub stars, the hackathon win, the accelerator — all of that belongs to the old product. The current product, ORION, has no demonstrated traction at all. I've seen plenty of pivots work — Justin.tv became Twitch — but that pivot happened over years of watching how users actually engaged with streaming, not over a few months of repositioning before a batch starts. When a company reshapes itself this quickly, the question I need answered is: did they discover something real during their geospatial work that pulled them toward SAR translation, or did they decide "foundation model" would play better at YC?

The honest answer is I don't know, and that's a problem. Dhenenjay Yadav worked as an ML engineer at ISRO, which is a genuine connection to satellite data. That's not nothing. It's plausible that working with geospatial imagery led him to viscerally understand how useless SAR backscatter is for most analysts, and that this frustration eventually crystallized into ORION. But the full trajectory — ISRO to MBA to VC roles to agritech startup to geospatial IDE to foundation model — reads more like a founder searching a domain for the right idea than a founder who stumbled into an unbearable problem and couldn't walk away. The schlep itself is real: SAR physics, paired training data, defense procurement cycles, establishing trust in AI-generated imagery for operational use. That kind of painful complexity genuinely deters competitors. But I keep returning to my core test: the schlep has to be something you discovered through experience, not something you identified as a moat through analysis.

The strongest case for this company is the technical team. Atharva Peshkar has real research credentials — PhD at CU Boulder, Harvard Visual Computing Group, two-time Microsoft Imagine Cup national champion in India and world finalist. Yadav himself is technical, having done ML work at ISRO. This is a two-hacker founding team that appears to have actually built a working model, not a slide deck. The reported benchmarks — FID of 30.24 (19% improvement over SOTA), real-time inference at 0.06 seconds, deterministic one-step diffusion — suggest genuine engineering craft. If those numbers hold, the architecture is a meaningful contribution. The structural market position is also interesting: SAR operators won't cannibalize their hardware business to become AI companies, and optical satellite companies like Planet won't build tools that make their own data unnecessary. AxionOrbital sits in a gap that both sides have incentive to leave open. If they can establish themselves as the translation layer between SAR data and human analysts, the position could be durable.

But even granting all of that, I'm stuck on two problems. First, Peshkar joined as co-founder sometime between September 2025 and the batch start — he's been on this specific problem for maybe four months. That's a co-founder who was recruited for the pivot, not one who co-discovered the problem. I've written about this: when co-founders meet specifically to start a company, the relationship hasn't been tested by adversity. I don't know the full story of how they connected, but the timeline is concerning. Second, the SSIM score of 0.60 is being presented as a strength, but an SSIM of 0.60 means the generated images still differ meaningfully from real optical imagery. For the defense and intelligence customers they're targeting, where a misidentified vehicle or hallucinated structure could have operational consequences, that gap matters enormously. The trust barrier in defense AI procurement is measured in years, not quarters.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? Yadav's ISRO experience would need to have given him not just domain knowledge but genuine relationships with defense and intelligence buyers — the kind of connections that let you get a pilot program running before the model is perfect. The ORION architecture would need to be a real technical step-function, not just an incremental improvement on academic SAR-to-optical papers. And the co-founders would need to have a deeper relationship than the timeline suggests — perhaps they collaborated at Indian academic competitions or through overlapping research communities before Peshkar formally joined. If all three of those things were true, the company occupies a structurally interesting position with a technically capable team attacking a problem with genuine schlep. But I don't have evidence for any of them, and at pre-seed, conviction has to come from somewhere.

The technology is impressive, the market gap is real, and the schlep will deter casual competitors. But the pivot timeline, the absence of any user signal for the current product, and the lack of a clear organic origin story keep me on the wrong side of the line. Smart people building something technically interesting in a domain they know — that describes a lot of companies that never find product-market fit. What I want to see is a founder who can't stop working on SAR translation because the problem won't leave them alone, and evidence that someone out there is pulling this product toward them. I see neither yet.
