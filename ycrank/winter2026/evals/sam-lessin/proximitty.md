# Proximitty -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This company's own tags tell me everything I need to know before I read a single paragraph of the dossier: "SaaS, B2B, Fintech." The pitch is "AI agents that automate loan servicing and debt collection." I want to be generous here, but this is precisely the category of startup I've been writing about for two years as structurally uninvestable. If I ask my core screening question -- would this business exist without AI? -- the answer is unambiguously no. Remove the AI agents and there is no product, no data layer, no company. The entire value proposition IS the AI capability. That's not a business; that's a feature waiting for LoanPro, which already has $100 million in funding and $24.3 million in revenue, to ship it as an upgrade to their existing platform. Or for Prodigal, a YC-backed competitor that launched proAgent in 2025 -- an AI agent specifically for consumer finance -- with years of production data and lender trust already in hand.

The founders are credible people. Ho has fintech growth experience from Taptap Send and McKinsey analytical chops. Zhang spent five years building security infrastructure at Bloomberg and maintains ACI.dev, an open-source tool-calling platform with 4,700 GitHub stars and 30 contributors. These are competent operators with relevant backgrounds. But the idea isn't insane -- it's extremely consensus. Every fintech-focused VC in the market understands "AI agents for collections" immediately. Nobody at a demo day is confused or uncomfortable hearing this pitch. Multiple well-capitalized competitors are building near-identical products. When the idea is obvious, the founder premium evaporates because you're buying execution risk in a crowded market at whatever valuation YC sets, and the structural advantage belongs to incumbents with distribution.

Here's what I find genuinely interesting, though, and it's also what makes me most skeptical: Zhang's ACI.dev is literally an open-source platform that integrates 600+ tools for AI agents. He understands agent infrastructure at a deep level -- that's real credibility. But it also reveals the commoditization problem from the inside. If the tooling layer for AI agents is being open-sourced (by this very co-founder!), the defensibility of any specific AI agent deployment narrows to the data it's trained on and the integrations it maintains. Proximitty's "unified lending data layer" sounds sticky -- and there's a version of this story where once a bank integrates its LMS, dialer, email, and internal tools and trains browser agents on its SOPs, switching costs become material. But that's a theoretical data moat at pre-seed scale with zero verified customers. The dossier says "trusted by publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" with no names disclosed. I've seen that claim enough times to know it usually means a pilot or two, not production deployment at scale.

The strongest bull case: regulated financial services is one of the few sectors where AI agents face genuine barriers. FDCPA, TCPA, CFPB, SCRA, state-level rules -- the compliance surface area is enormous, and a company that builds institutional trust around autonomous borrower-facing AI could create lock-in that generic software cannot. Banks are pathologically risk-averse about switching vendors once compliance is validated. If Proximitty could get three or four major lenders deployed and generating compliance track records, the switching costs become regulatory rather than merely technical. That's a real moat -- not a software moat but an institutional-trust moat. And the 6-18 month enterprise sales cycles that threaten a two-person team's runway could also be a barrier that protects them once they're inside. I take this argument seriously. But it applies equally to Prodigal, which has a multi-year head start on building exactly this kind of trust with lenders, and to incumbents like Fiserv who already have the relationships.

Ultimately, this is an AI-first company where AI is the core value proposition, building in a category with well-funded competitors, with no physical-world operations, no protocol-layer positioning, and no demonstrated revenue. It's the inverse of what I look for. A painting company with a tech layer creates a moat AI can't replicate. A tech company automating collections creates a moat that every competitor with an LLM API key can approximate. The narrative can stretch from "AI collections agents" to "autonomous lending infrastructure," which has some elasticity, but it's still a vertical application -- not a primitive that other businesses build on. Nobody's deploying Proximitty as infrastructure for their own lending product the way developers build on a protocol. I'd need to see this team building the underlying agent infrastructure layer for financial services -- something closer to what ACI.dev represents but for regulated finance specifically -- rather than the application layer on top. That would be a different conversation entirely.
