# Burt -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Burt is almost a platonic ideal of the company I pass on. A two-person team building managed LLM fine-tuning — the exact category where every major cloud provider, a half-dozen well-capitalized startups, and a growing constellation of open-source tools are converging simultaneously. Together AI has raised $534 million. Fireworks AI has raised $327 million. And Predibase, the closest standalone comparable to what Burt describes on its YC page, got absorbed by Rubrik for roughly $100 million after raising $28 million — which tells you everything about where this segment is heading. Standalone fine-tuning platforms are features waiting to be swallowed by larger stacks. That's not a business. That's a résumé line on the way to an acqui-hire.

The founder-idea calibration here fails on both axes of my primary filter. Bobby Zhong has hustle and YC ecosystem reps — founding engineer at Pirros, engineer at Replo, a couple of earlier projects — but that's generalist startup experience, not deep ML research credibility or logistics industry expertise. The "sane" component requires that the founder's specific background lends disproportionate credibility to THIS particular bet. A senior research scientist from DeepMind building a fine-tuning platform? That's sane. A logistics operations VP who spent a decade drowning in invoice processing building AI automation for freight? Also sane. A young full-stack engineer with a year at each of two YC startups? That's just someone smart and ambitious in a market where smart and ambitious is table stakes. And the "insane" component? There's nothing non-consensus about fine-tuning specialized models. Every ML engineer on the planet knows smaller models can outperform general-purpose ones on narrow tasks. This is the most obvious idea in AI right now.

The product positioning ambiguity is the detail that crystallizes my concern. The YC page describes a horizontal fine-tuning platform. The live website describes logistics back-office automation. These are fundamentally different businesses with different moats, different customers, and different competitive dynamics. When a pre-seed company can't even tell a consistent story about what it IS, that's not a pivot in progress — that's a team still searching for a problem worth solving. I've seen this pattern dozens of times: technically capable founders who can build anything, casting around for a use case, describing different products to different audiences. The horizontal play puts them directly against companies with hundreds of millions in funding. The vertical logistics play is more interesting but requires domain depth neither founder demonstrably has.

The strongest bull case would be this: if Burt commits fully to logistics, builds deep specialization in freight document formats — bills of lading, rate confirmations, proof-of-delivery documents — and accumulates proprietary training data across customer deployments, they could develop genuine switching costs. Logistics is messy, fragmented, and full of manual processes that resist automation because document formats vary wildly across carriers and shippers. A company that goes deep enough into that operational reality, builds models trained on thousands of proprietary document variations, and wraps it in workflow automation could become a Craftwork-style play: AI as the cherry on top of domain-specific operational knowledge. The cloud providers' misalignment — they profit from selling more compute, while Burt's value proposition is using LESS compute through smaller models — is a legitimate structural observation. But for this bull case to work, the founders would need to demonstrate logistics industry relationships, commit publicly to the vertical, and show that their fine-tuning expertise translates into durable customer lock-in. None of that evidence exists today.

My "AI kill test" produces the clearest signal here: if AI didn't exist, this business doesn't exist. That's definitionally a company where AI IS the product, not the cherry on top. And in a world where AI capabilities are commoditizing faster than any technology layer in history, a company whose moat is "we fine-tune models better" is building on sand. The next open-source framework, the next model release that makes fine-tuning unnecessary for a class of tasks, the next incumbent feature launch — any of these can eliminate the value proposition overnight. I'd literally rather fund a painting company with a scheduling app than an AI company competing against Together AI with a two-person team and no proprietary data.
