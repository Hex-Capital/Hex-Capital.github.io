# Tepali -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know before you examine anything else. Boulevard raised $80 million in July 2025 explicitly to expand into medspas with AI features. Zenoti has $331 million in funding and $174 million in revenue serving the broader wellness vertical. AestheticsPro already operates as a medspa-specific incumbent with "thousands" of users. Mangomint and Vagaro are expanding from the salon side. This is not a market where a two-person pre-seed team has identified something the world has missed -- this is a market where well-capitalized companies have already identified the same opportunity and are racing to capture it. The Girardian dynamics are textbook: multiple players imitating each other's feature sets, converging on the same vertical thesis, competing for the same medspa operators. When everyone agrees that "medspas need integrated AI software," there is no secret. There is only competition.

The question I always ask is: what important truth does this company see that no one else sees? I cannot identify one. "Medical spas use fragmented software and would benefit from a consolidated, AI-native platform" is not contrarian -- it is the explicit investment thesis behind Boulevard's $80 million raise. The dossier itself notes that Boulevard cited the "Botox and GLP-1 surge" as a demand driver. Every venture-backed player in this space has read the same Grand View Research report about 15% CAGR. When a pre-seed startup enters a market where a $800 million-valued competitor has just raised specifically to build the same product category, the founder is not exploiting a secret -- they are joining a crowd. And crowds, as Girard understood, do not create value. They destroy it through mimetic rivalry.

The founding team raises a separate concern that compounds the competitive problem. Chrisvin Jabamani comes from investment banking at PJT Partners and business operations at Rilla. These are respectable credentials, but they are the credentials of someone who analyzes businesses, not someone who has lived inside the medspa industry and discovered a hidden truth about how it operates. Neither founder has visible medspa domain expertise -- clinical, operational, or as an owner. When I backed Palantir, the founding insight came from years of building anti-fraud systems at PayPal; the secret was born from direct operational experience with a specific technical problem. When I backed the team at Anduril, Palmer Luckey had spent years building hardware in his garage and understood the defense procurement system's failures from the inside. Here, I see a finance professional who identified a market opportunity by reading the same data everyone reads. The AI layer -- natural language queries across business data -- is becoming table stakes across every vertical SaaS category. It is not proprietary technology; it is an LLM wrapper, and wrappers are not moats.

The strongest argument for Tepali would require believing that the HIPAA compliance layer creates a structural wedge that horizontal salon platforms cannot cross without alienating their core customers, and that Tepali can become the system of record for independent medspas before Boulevard and AestheticsPro consolidate the market. If Tepali moved extraordinarily fast, embedded itself so deeply into a cluster of medspas that patient records, treatment histories, and financial data became migration-prohibitive, and then expanded concentrically into adjacent medical aesthetics verticals, there is a plausible path to defensible market position. The Stripe analogy is worth considering -- Stripe entered a market with many payment processors but created switching costs through depth of integration. But Stripe had a genuine 10x improvement: seven lines of code replaced weeks of payment integration work. What is Tepali's 10x? Consolidating six tools into one is a convenience improvement, perhaps 2-3x better than managing six separate logins. That is not the order-of-magnitude leap that creates structural monopoly advantage. And the medspa management software TAM -- roughly $300 million globally -- means that even total market capture would not produce power-law returns. This is a business that could become a decent small company, not one that could return a fund.

The rename from "Lotus" to "Tepali" is a minor detail, but it is symptomatic of a broader pattern: this company appears to be iterating toward a market position rather than executing a definite vision. The email domain is still uselotus.ai. The GitHub repos reference "lotus-mcp." When a company cannot even commit to its own name, I question whether the founders have the kind of singular, immovable conviction that characterizes the companies I back. Zuckerberg did not rename Facebook. Musk did not pivot SpaceX. The founders who build enduring monopolies are the ones who see the future so clearly that the details -- including the name -- are settled from the beginning.
