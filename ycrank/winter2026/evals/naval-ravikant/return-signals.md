# Return Signals -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Ilya Valmianski is that he built SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente -- a conversational AI system trained on 25 million primary care encounters, deployed at scale across Southern California. That's not a toy. That's the kind of system where you learn things about conversational AI deployment that can't be extracted from papers or courses. The question I keep returning to: is his specific knowledge about *conversational AI as a medium*, or about *the problem he's now applying it to*? Because those are very different things. A surgeon who's mastered the scalpel doesn't automatically understand carpentry just because both involve cutting. Ilya knows how to build systems that triage human dissatisfaction through dialogue. He does not, as far as the evidence shows, know anything non-obvious about why people return clothes.

The MDandMe trajectory sharpens this concern. He founded an AI symptom checker in February 2023, raised $2M by June 2023, and by 2025 he's running a completely different company in a completely different vertical. That pattern -- talented builder searching for the right application of a general-purpose capability -- is one I've learned to distinguish from the pattern I actually want to fund: someone who's been obsessing about a specific problem for years and finally has the tools to solve it. Evan Williams didn't pivot from healthcare chatbots to Twitter. He spent a decade thinking about how humans communicate publicly. The insight and the medium were inseparable. Here, the technical capability is searching for a domain, and e-commerce returns is where it landed. That's founder-tool fit, not founder-problem fit.

The leverage architecture is standard B2B SaaS -- code serves multiple merchants through a shared model, which is baseline leverage for any software company. But there are no network effects. Brand A's return conversations don't make Brand B's experience better unless they build a shared training pipeline, which isn't described. Each merchant requires a 6-week pilot integration. The company sits at the application layer, not the infrastructure layer. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question and answer made the entire knowledge graph more valuable for every subsequent developer. Or to Alchemy, where every blockchain developer building on the platform deepened the infrastructure moat. Return Signals is deploying existing infrastructure -- LLMs, Twilio, Shopify APIs -- to a specific use case. The value creation is real but linear.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If the 70% exchange conversion rate holds at scale, that's extraordinary value creation -- turning refunds into exchanges preserves merchant revenue entirely. The proactive outbound SMS approach genuinely disrupts incumbents whose business models depend on processing return volume, not reducing it. Loop, Narvar, and AfterShip would have to cannibalize their own revenue to compete. And Ilya's SmartTriage work at Kaiser -- 25M+ encounters with sensitive, empathetic conversational AI -- is arguably harder than anything he'd face in e-commerce. The LLM timing is real: this product wasn't buildable at this quality level two years ago. If the conversational data compounds into a proprietary understanding of product-issue taxonomies and exchange patterns across thousands of brands, the moat could emerge over time. That's a legitimate path. But it requires the data to actually compound in ways that aren't replicable by an incumbent with existing merchant relationships and far more data on return patterns.

The contrarian positioning is weaker than it first appears. "Use AI to reduce e-commerce returns" is not a bet against the crowd -- it's what every returns platform pitch deck already says. The specific insight -- proactive outbound rather than reactive portal -- has some genuine non-consensus flavor, but the broader category of AI agents for customer interaction is one of the most consensus plays in the current market. Twenty teams at YC alone are probably building AI agents for various customer touchpoints. The $849.9 billion returns figure appears in so many decks that citing it has become a signal of consensus thinking, not contrarian conviction.

I respect Ilya's technical depth. An 836-citation physicist who shipped production ML at Kaiser Permanente scale is not someone I dismiss. But I need the specific knowledge to be about the problem, not just the tool. Neither founder has documented experience in e-commerce, retail, merchandising, or the Shopify ecosystem. The company is well-executed but structurally a vertical SaaS application built on commoditized infrastructure, competing against incumbents with $307M+ in combined funding and existing merchant relationships. The absence of network effects, the application-layer positioning, and the domain knowledge gap all point away from the kind of asymmetric, compounding bet I'm looking for.
