# Aemon -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me first: twin brothers. After what happened with HQ Trivia -- a company that had the right product at the right time and died entirely because two co-founders couldn't resolve their differences -- I started explicitly looking for teams with built-in conflict resolution. I've said I have an affinity for family-run businesses, and twin brothers who published together at ICLR and EMNLP, dropped out of school together, went through Afore Capital together, and are now building a company together at age twenty -- that's about as strong a co-founder alignment signal as I'll ever see in a dossier. Ray and Richard have clearly been stress-testing their partnership their entire lives. On this one dimension, Aemon gives me real comfort.

But when I try to do what I always do first -- ask the founders to tell me their story, not the business -- I come up mostly empty. What I see are two academically gifted young men who followed a natural trajectory from competitive math and robotics medals to AI research to a YC startup. That's impressive, genuinely. Publishing at top-tier conferences before twenty is rare. But "impressive" is not the same as the thing I'm actually listening for. I want to know: what happened to you that made this problem yours? Where's the hardship that forged an unbreakable connection between these founders and the specific challenge of autonomous R&D optimization? I don't hear it. I hear talent seeking a worthy problem, not a problem that found the only people who could solve it. When I backed the Crusoe team, or when I invested in Contraline after its founder spent years in academic obscurity on male contraception, the biographical thread was so tight you couldn't separate the person from the mission. Here, I could imagine Ray and Richard building any number of technically demanding AI products with equal enthusiasm, and that looseness between founder and problem concerns me.

The harder issue for me is consensus. My entire thesis is built on finding companies that are not popular, that are difficult to assess, that other investors consider too strange to touch. AI is the most consensus investment category I've seen since social media in 2012. "AI for R&D and scientific discovery" specifically has attracted Sakana AI at a $2.65 billion valuation, Periodic Labs at a $300 million seed, and Google DeepMind's own AlphaEvolve internally. The core evolutionary search technique Aemon uses is documented in published papers and reproduced by multiple open-source projects -- OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve -- some of which have matched or beaten the same benchmarks Aemon cites. The circle packing result is genuinely cool, but it's become a leaderboard sport where new records appear regularly. When the underlying paradigm is well-understood, the technique is commoditized, and the space is drowning in capital, the weirdness has been priced out. This doesn't feel like SpaceX when everyone said private rockets were insane, or Uber when ride-sharing was illegal. This feels like a smart execution play in the hottest market on earth.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because it's real. If these founders have genuinely figured out how to achieve AlphaEvolve-quality results at three orders of magnitude less cost -- under ten dollars of compute for a world-record result -- that's a legitimate technical edge, even if it's not yet independently verified. Google validated that the approach works but has no incentive to build a commercial product for external teams. That gap between "Google proved it internally" and "nobody can buy it" is a real market opportunity. And there's an argument that Aemon makes an invisible system visible -- right now, R&D optimization is driven by expert intuition and manual experimentation, and Aemon could make the solution space transparent and explorable in a way that's Carta-like in its ambition. If they can convert that benchmark advantage into reliable, repeatable workflows across diverse engineering domains and lock in enterprise design partners before Google decides to commercialize, there's a path to something meaningful. Twenty-year-old founders with this level of technical ability and family-level co-founder trust are rare, and I don't want to dismiss that.

But I keep coming back to what I don't see. I don't see economic access -- this is a tool for well-resourced engineering teams, not something that creates opportunity for people who currently lack it. I don't see regulatory complexity or stigma that would create a moat and deter other investors. I don't see a biographical narrative that makes these founders uniquely suited to persist through the inevitable crises of building a company in a space where Google could decide to compete at any moment. And I don't feel that jolt of intuitive energy -- the daydreaming quality where I can imagine the company's full potential and feel visceral excitement. What I feel instead is respect for their talent and concern about their defensibility. Talent in a commoditized space with no structural moat is a hard bet for me. This is a pass, but I'd want to meet them -- because sometimes the story isn't in the dossier, and if there's a survival narrative underneath the academic credentials, I'd want to hear it before it becomes consensus.
