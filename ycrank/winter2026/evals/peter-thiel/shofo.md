# Shofo -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing thing about Shofo is its self-description: "Common Crawl for Video." The founders have chosen an analogy that undermines their own thesis. Common Crawl works because the open web is, by definition, open -- it is a public resource that anyone can index without permission. Short-form video on TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn is the opposite: proprietary content behind terms of service, created by people who never consented to their cooking tutorials being segmented and relabeled as AI training data. The analogy breaks down at the exact point where it needs to hold. A company whose foundational data asset depends on the continued tolerance of hostile platforms -- platforms that are actively suing AI companies for exactly this kind of usage -- is not building on a secret. It is building on borrowed time.

What is the secret here? The implied thesis is straightforward: AI labs need massive volumes of labeled video data, social media is the richest source, and nobody has built the infrastructure to index and deliver it at scale. Every clause of that sentence is consensus. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Meta, and Anthropic all know they need video data -- it is the most discussed bottleneck in multimodal AI training. The fact that social media contains valuable training data is so widely understood that it has spawned multiple lawsuits and regulatory actions. And "nobody has built the infrastructure" is simply false -- Scale AI processes video at enormous scale, Encord specializes in physical AI data including video, and any of these companies could add a sourcing layer to their existing annotation pipelines within months. When every AI researcher, every data labeling company, and every social media platform can articulate the same opportunity, there is no secret. There is only a market that will be competed into zero margins.

The Meta-Scale AI disruption is the one structurally interesting element in this landscape. Meta's 49% stake in Scale AI genuinely compromised the platform's neutrality, and Google and OpenAI are searching for alternatives. This creates a window -- but a window is not a moat. It is an invitation for every data startup and incumbent to rush through the same opening simultaneously. The Girardian dynamics are textbook: a dozen companies imitating each other's response to the same market signal, all converging on the same customers with the same pitch. Encord just raised $110 million. Labelbox has $189 million and backing from Andreessen Horowitz and SoftBank. When the opening is obvious to everyone, the result is competition, not monopoly. And Scale AI itself, with $15.9 billion in total funding and $870 million in 2024 revenue, could build a dedicated video indexing service as a feature, not a company.

The bull case requires believing that Shofo's video index, if built first and at sufficient scale, creates a data moat analogous to Google's search index -- where the accumulated breadth, metadata quality, and annotation accuracy become impossible to replicate regardless of funding. If that were true, and if the legal terrain stabilized in favor of indexing publicly accessible content, Shofo could become the default neutral video data provider for every AI lab except Meta. That is a real business. But the analogy to Google's search index fails on two dimensions: Google indexed a genuinely open web where content creators wanted to be found, and Google's ranking algorithms represented proprietary technology that improved with every query. Shofo indexes closed platforms where content creators do not want their work repurposed, and its labeling pipeline uses standard human-in-the-loop annotation that any well-resourced team can replicate. The data asset is not proprietary in the way that matters.

The founders are young and clearly capable of shipping product -- Correkt reached 40,000 users, which is a nontrivial achievement for undergraduates. Misra's decision to drop out of UCSB to build companies is the kind of signal I generally value. But the pivot from Correkt to Shofo is concerning precisely because it suggests the opposite of definite optimism. A founder with a specific vision of the future does not abandon a product with 40,000 users to enter a different market. The pivot reads as opportunistic repositioning toward a hot market -- video data for AI -- rather than the execution of a singular vision the founder has been unable to let go of. I see no evidence that these founders have a detailed, specific plan for what the world looks like if they succeed, beyond "we will be the place AI labs get video data." That is a business plan, not a vision for the future. And at the technical level, Braga's NLP research background is solid but not aligned with the core challenge of building and maintaining a video index at petabyte scale -- that is an infrastructure and data engineering problem, not an NLP problem.

The technology is not discontinuous. Web scraping, video indexing, and human-in-the-loop labeling are established techniques combined into a bundle. The bundling itself -- sourcing plus annotation -- is a legitimate product insight, since competitors primarily label data that customers bring to them. But bundling is a go-to-market strategy, not a 10x technological advantage. Nothing about this approach makes the prior way of obtaining video training data structurally obsolete. It makes it marginally more convenient, which invites competition from anyone who can combine scraping infrastructure with annotation pipelines -- which is to say, every major player in the space.
