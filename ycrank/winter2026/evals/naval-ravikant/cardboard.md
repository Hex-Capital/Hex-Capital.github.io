# Cardboard -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me almost everything I need to know about the timing. Descript has $101M and ~$55M ARR. Runway has $860M. OpusClip has $50M. Kapwing has been browser-native for years. When I invested in Bitcoin in 2014, the whole world thought I was wrong. When I backed Uber at $4M, ride-sharing was literally illegal. Here, the entire market has already decided AI video editing is the future -- $1B+ in venture capital says so. Cardboard is not betting against a gloomy crowd. They're entering an arena where the crowd is euphoric and the other fighters are well-armed. You don't get paid for being right when everyone else is also right. You get paid for being right first, and in AI video editing, "first" was three years ago.

The specific knowledge question is where I'm most conflicted. Ishan Sharma has genuine browser engineering depth -- 4.5 years building performance-critical web applications at HackerRank, and building a utility with 5.7 million downloads at age 14. That's not taught in any classroom. The WebGPU/WebCodecs stack they're building on is legitimately hard to work with at production quality, and Ishan's skills are directly applicable. Saksham's content creation at 250K monthly views gives him firsthand experience with the pain of video production, and his ACL publication suggests real NLP capability. But here's the distinction: their specific knowledge is about *how to build web applications* and *how to call AI APIs*, not about the deep structure of video editing itself. Neither founder has spent years inside post-production workflows understanding why editors make the choices they make, what separates a broadcast-quality cut from an amateur one, or how marketing teams actually coordinate video review cycles. When I backed Notion, Ivan Zhao had been thinking about the relationship between tools and thought for years before writing a line of product code. The insight preceded the engineering. Here, the engineering capability is real but the domain insight feels acquired through general observation rather than obsessive immersion.

The leverage architecture is interesting but not transformative. Cardboard does multiply output -- a marketing team that previously needed an agency or a skilled editor can now get first-cut edits from natural language prompts. That's real. But it's making existing leverage cheaper, not creating a category of leverage that didn't exist. Twitter compressed public thought into a new medium. Uber turned every car into a commercial vehicle. Cardboard makes video editing faster for people who already produce video. The Canva comparison is more apt than the Twitter comparison -- and Canva is a great business, but it took a decade and a billion dollars to build its moat. At the pre-seed stage with two founders competing against Descript's 400+ person team, the leverage ratio between what they can build and what they're up against is inverted.

The strongest bull case is the compound architecture thesis: building both the browser NLE and the agentic AI layer from scratch, simultaneously, is something no incumbent can easily do. Adobe can't rewrite Premiere for the browser without breaking professional workflows. Kapwing has the browser platform but hasn't built an agentic-first AI layer. Descript's text-based editing paradigm is architectural, not something you bolt agentic generation onto. If Cardboard nails both sides of this bet -- a performant browser NLE *and* an AI director that produces broadcast-quality first cuts -- they occupy a unique position that's genuinely hard to replicate. The 15-year co-founder relationship is the kind of foundation that survives the years of grinding this compound bet requires. And 1K+ users with 4.5-star reviews at pre-seed is real signal that the product works. The "why now" is technically sound -- WebGPU and multimodal LLMs both crossed threshold capability in 2024-2025, creating a genuine window.

But I keep returning to the leverage framework. The agentic editing core runs on Claude Sonnet -- a third-party model they don't control and didn't build. This means Cardboard's core AI intelligence is rented, not owned. When I invest in Extropic or Atomic Semi, the company *is* the fundamental technology. Here, the fundamental technology belongs to Anthropic. If Claude improves, everyone who calls the API improves. If Claude raises prices, Cardboard's margins compress. If Anthropic decides to ship video editing features, Cardboard is in trouble. This is the opposite of compounding technology -- it's a dependency that could be pulled out from underneath them. The browser NLE itself is harder to commoditize, but Kapwing already proves it can be built. The real question is whether the orchestration layer -- translating "make me a 30-second hook" into a production-quality timeline -- compounds into something defensible through usage data and iteration. That's possible, but it's an execution hypothesis, not a technology moat I can evaluate today.

I'd summarize the bet this way: smart builders, real engineering talent, working product, genuine pain point -- but consensus market, rented AI, application-layer not infrastructure, and specific knowledge that's about building rather than about editing. The compound architecture thesis is intellectually appealing but requires winning on two difficult frontiers simultaneously with $500K against competitors with $1B+ in combined funding. I've learned to distinguish between companies that are hard to build and companies that are hard to compete with. Cardboard is hard to build. Whether it's hard to compete with once built -- that's the open question, and I don't have enough conviction to write the check.
