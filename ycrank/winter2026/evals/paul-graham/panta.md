# Panta -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Panta is that YC has funded at least four companies attacking AI-powered commercial insurance brokerage in recent batches. Harper is one batch ahead doing almost exactly the same thing and already reports $2.3 million in revenue. Fernstone, RiskCube -- the list keeps going. When I see this many smart teams converging on the same category at the same time, I get nervous. It usually means the idea emerged from the same source: someone read that commercial insurance is a $140 billion brokerage market running on email and phone calls, noticed that LLMs can now process unstructured documents, and concluded this was ripe for disruption. That's not organic discovery. That's reading TechCrunch.

The question I always ask first is: how did the founders find this problem? Vincent Chen was an ML engineer at Google working on foundation models. Frank Wang was a senior full-stack engineer at Apple. Neither has any visible connection to the insurance industry. There's no story of a founder who spent years watching brokers re-key data and thought "this is insane." There's no personal frustration with getting a commercial policy placed. The causal chain appears to run from "AI can automate document-heavy workflows" to "insurance brokerage is document-heavy" -- which is a perfectly logical deduction, but it's the kind of idea that gets generated in a brainstorming session, not stumbled into through lived experience. When the Collison brothers built Stripe, they weren't thinking about the payments market -- they were annoyed that accepting money online was absurdly difficult. That personal irritation is what carries you through years of dealing with banks and regulators. I don't see its equivalent here.

Now, the bull case deserves a full hearing, because there is something genuinely impressive here. The schlep in surplus lines brokerage for heavy industry is enormous -- possibly one of the highest-schlep problems I've seen in a YC batch. Getting licensed as a surplus lines brokerage in all fifty states is not a weekend project. Building relationships with 100+ A-rated carriers as a four-person startup requires real hustle. And the explosive materials underwriting demo -- processing seventy pages of chemistry documentation that traditionally takes three weeks -- shows they're not avoiding the ugly complexity. They're running toward it. The vertical focus on construction, oil and gas, and manufacturing is exactly the "keep the fire contained to get it really hot" approach that works. If I squint, this looks like a team that identified the schlepiest corner of an already schlep-heavy industry and decided to start there. That's strategically sound, even if the origin wasn't organic.

The 127 reviews at 4.9 stars and the 99% placement rate are interesting traction signals for a pre-seed company, though the unspecified review platform makes them hard to weight. "Multiple commercial policies" bound is vague, but binding any real commercial insurance policy means real money changed hands and a real business got covered. That's more than a prototype. The technical team is solid -- Google ML expertise for the AI agents, Apple full-stack engineering for the platform. Though I notice Frank Wang is described as a "top open-source contributor to the Rust and Gleam ecosystems" while his public GitHub shows zero repositories, which is an odd discrepancy that I'd want to understand.

What keeps me from getting excited is the combination of manufactured origin and crowded field. This is a category where multiple well-funded teams are converging simultaneously, which means the AI technology itself isn't a moat -- it's table stakes. The moat has to come from carrier relationships, regulatory licensing, and accumulated underwriting data, which are real but take years to compound. Harper has a one-batch head start with meaningful revenue already flowing. Panta's differentiation is vertical specialization in heavy industry, which is smart, but it's a strategic positioning choice, not a structural advantage. Any competitor can decide to focus on heavy industry verticals too. The founders are competent engineers applying AI to a large market, but I don't see the obsessive founder-problem fit that produces companies willing to grind through a decade of insurance industry complexity. Insurance is a relationship business at its core, and the founders are entering it as outsiders.

I could be wrong. If these founders have the determination to spend years navigating carrier politics, regulatory changes, and the slow trust-building that insurance requires -- and if their heavy industry vertical focus gives them enough breathing room from Harper and others to build a data moat -- this could work. The structural economics are genuinely attractive: brokerage commissions with software-level headcount. But I've seen too many smart engineers decide that a large, inefficient market plus AI equals a good startup. Sometimes it does. More often, the founders discover that the industry's inefficiency was load-bearing -- that the human relationships and domain knowledge they're trying to automate were the product, not overhead. I'd want to see evidence that these founders understand insurance at a level beyond "it's manual and slow."
