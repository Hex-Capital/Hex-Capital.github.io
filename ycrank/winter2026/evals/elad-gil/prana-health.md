# Prana -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Forward Health raised over $600 million to build AI-first primary care and shut down in 2024. That's the fact I can't look past. When a company with that much capital fails in the exact market you're entering, the question isn't "what gap did they leave?" -- it's "what has structurally changed that makes the economics work now when they didn't work 18 months ago with 1000x your resources?" I don't see a compelling answer here. LLMs improved incrementally, but Forward had access to GPT-4 class models. Wearable adoption grew steadily, not discontinuously. There's no Webvan-to-Instacart pattern here because the infrastructure gap that killed Webvan (last-mile logistics) was a solvable problem that Instacart eventually solved with smartphones and gig workers. The gap that killed Forward -- making AI primary care economically viable at scale -- hasn't been solved by any external technology shift. Prana is entering the same structural challenge with a fraction of the capital.

The market itself is the opposite of what I look for. Healthcare AI attracted $4 billion in venture funding in 2025. K Health has $439 million and partnerships with Mayo Clinic and Cedars-Sinai. Ro has over a billion raised and nearly $600 million in annualized revenue. Hippocratic AI just closed a $141 million Series B at a $1.6 billion valuation. This is not a "too boring" or "too niche" market that other investors are overlooking -- this is a consensus-hot sector with deep-pocketed incumbents already operating at the intersection of AI and licensed care. When I invested in PagerDuty, operations alerting seemed boring to everyone else. When I invested in Gusto, payroll seemed unglamorous. AI primary care is on the cover of every health tech publication. The TAM slide writes itself -- and as I've said repeatedly, when the TAM slide writes itself, the asymmetric returns are already priced out.

The multi-miracle problem is what structurally disqualifies this for me. Prana needs to simultaneously: (1) build clinically accurate AI that doesn't miss dangerous conditions in a liability-intensive environment, (2) maintain physician licensing and malpractice coverage across all 50 states, (3) make unit economics work at $39 per physician visit while covering doctor compensation and clinical infrastructure, and (4) acquire patients affordably against a brand name ("Prana") that competes with a major outdoor clothing line, a breathing app with 2 million users, and multiple other entities in search results. Each of these is hard. Together, they compound low-probability events into near-certain failure. I also have a nagging concern about the "software-aware vs. software-driven" distinction: at its core, this is a medical practice that uses AI to reduce labor costs. The margin structure -- paying physicians, carrying malpractice insurance, managing clinical liability -- is a healthcare margin structure, not a software margin structure.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. Primary care is a truly massive, structurally broken market -- the US healthcare system's cost structure is unsustainable, and if an AI-first provider can genuinely handle 90% of primary care interactions while maintaining clinical accuracy, the value creation is enormous. The team has real domain credibility: Patel's biomedical engineering background with NIH research and Danaher-backed diagnostics, Rawal's quantitative data infrastructure chops from algorithmic trading, and Menon bringing both an MD and prior health-tech startup experience at EminenceAI. The execution velocity is genuinely notable for a pre-seed company -- live product on three platforms treating 100+ conditions, and those 3,412 reviews (if authentic) suggest meaningful early adoption. The employer channel targeting self-insured companies for metabolic risk reduction is a smart B2B wedge that could provide higher-margin recurring revenue. And the regulatory complexity of being a licensed provider across 50 states is genuinely a moat -- it's the kind of compliance barrier I've profited from backing at Color Health and Coinbase. If the AI accuracy miracle gets delivered by foundation model labs (similar to how Harvey's miracle was delivered by OpenAI), then Prana could ride that capability curve while focusing on clinical workflow and distribution. That's a real scenario.

But the gap between that scenario and the current evidence is too wide. The founders haven't articulated a distribution strategy beyond "free AI consultations plus employer pilots" -- there's no evidence of the aggressive distribution thinking I expect even at the earliest stage. The product-to-distribution trajectory is unclear: does a $39 primary care visit naturally expand into a platform for labs, pharmacy, specialist referrals, chronic disease management? Maybe, but the dossier shows no evidence the team has thought through this expansion. Compare that to how Stripe's developer API was a distribution strategy from day one, not just a product. Prana's initial product creates a patient relationship, but it's a thin one -- patients have no reason to prefer Prana over K Health or any telehealth provider that adds AI features next quarter. The longitudinal data moat the dossier describes is theoretically real but takes years to build and is unproven. I'd need to see either a radically different distribution insight or a clear single-miracle focus -- and neither is present.
