# SideKit -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is the company I describe when people ask me what I pass on. A single lightweight SDK that bundles version gating, feature flags, and analytics for mobile developers. The team is competent. The market exists. The technology works. And I stop right there — if this succeeds completely, captures every indie mobile developer on the planet, what changes? App binaries are slightly smaller. Developers integrate one SDK instead of three. The feature management market is $320 million and growing at 8.6% annually. Even dominant share of that market produces a nice business, not an industry transformation. Nobody's food system changes. Nobody's energy grid changes. No trillion-dollar incumbent wakes up terrified. The founders have chosen a problem where the consequence of full success is a convenience improvement — and convenience improvements are what I mean when I say people reduce the probability of failure until success becomes inconsequential.

The competitive landscape confirms this diagnosis. Firebase Remote Config is free and already embedded in millions of mobile apps. LaunchDarkly has $330 million in funding and $200 million in ARR. Statsig was just acquired by OpenAI for $1.1 billion. DevCycle is a YC alum in the same space. The dossier states plainly: "The technical barrier to replication is low. Any well-resourced incumbent could build equivalent functionality." When I funded Juniper Networks to challenge Cisco, the technology was architecturally different — TCP/IP routing versus legacy circuit-switching — and Cisco's CTO told me it was impossible. That dismissal was the signal. Here, nobody dismisses bundling three commodity developer tools into one SDK. It's a perfectly reasonable product idea. And perfectly reasonable product ideas that don't threaten any incumbent's existence are exactly the bets I avoid with my own money.

The strongest argument for SideKit is the timing angle around what people are calling "vibe coding" — AI tools like Cursor and Replit Agent lowering the barrier to building mobile apps, creating a wave of new developers who need production infrastructure but lack the expertise to assemble it from Firebase, LaunchDarkly, and custom version-gating logic. If that wave materializes at the scale some people predict, and SideKit becomes the default production toolkit for this new developer cohort the way Stripe became the default payments layer, you could get a meaningful outcome. Ashish Selvaraj's founder-market fit is genuine: he built an iOS app with 50,000 installs, encountered the exact fragmented tooling problem, built a private analytics solution for his own app, and then productized the insight. His reflection on the "12 products in 12 months" challenge — concluding that focused iteration on one problem beats shotgun experimentation — shows a real learning loop. These are not bad founders. But Stripe succeeded because payments infrastructure was a structurally broken trillion-dollar system with deep regulatory moats. Mobile SDK convenience is not structurally broken — it's mildly annoying. The analogy collapses at the consequence level.

I will give Ashish and Ethan this: they are young, technically capable, at Waterloo, and YC has them building. But they are two CS students solving a developer ergonomics problem in a crowded space with commodity technology and no structural moat. Seven GitHub stars, 11 commits, no revenue signal, no evidence of customers, and a free tier that creates acquisition without retention. The pricing — $9/month hobby, $42/month growth — tells me even their own ambition is calibrated to small outcomes. I would tell these founders what I tell every smart team working on a problem this size: you are too talented to spend your twenties making app deployment slightly less annoying. Go find a problem where success means the world works differently. Come back when you are attempting something that frightens you.
