# Forum -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Forum isn't the founders or the product -- it's the competitive landscape, and what it tells me about timing. Six months ago, "trade on attention" might have sounded delightfully strange to most investors. Today, Paradigm has led a $7.1M seed into Noise, Polymarket is partnering with Kaito to add attention markets in March, and Zora launched attention trading on Solana just last week. When I look at this, I don't see Forum arriving early to a non-consensus insight. I see a category that's forming consensus in real time, with multiple well-capitalized players already live and trading. The most promising companies are not popular -- and right now, attention markets are becoming very popular very fast. The "weird" is being priced out of this trade before Forum has even gone live with real money.

I always want to hear the founder's story before I assess the business. With Owen and Joseph, I have resumes but I don't have stories. Owen worked long/short equities at Balyasny, which is a $20 billion-plus multi-strategy hedge fund -- he clearly understands market microstructure, regulatory frameworks, and how exchanges work. Joseph has solid engineering credentials across NASA, GEICO, and DreamwaveAI. Both dropped out of university to build this, which shows real conviction. But "hedge fund associate builds a new exchange" is maybe the single most conventional fintech founder archetype in Silicon Valley. I can't find the biographical thread that connects either of these founders to attention markets specifically -- why THIS problem? What personal experience or hardship drove them here? When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception that everyone else ignored. That biographical commitment was the signal. Here, I see competent professionals pursuing a market opportunity, which is different from founders who are biographically bound to their mission.

The strongest argument for Forum is the regulatory strategy, and I want to give this real weight because I've built my career on backing founders who enter hard, regulated spaces that scare everyone else away. If Forum obtains CFTC designation as a Designated Contract Market, that's a genuine structural moat. Kalshi is the only startup that's achieved this, and it took years and millions in legal costs. None of the crypto-native competitors -- Noise, Zora, Polymarket -- can serve as a regulated U.S. exchange without fundamental architectural changes. The CFTC's January 2026 signals under Chairman Selig are favorable. So the bull case is clear: Forum becomes the Kalshi of attention, the only regulated venue in the United States for institutional and retail traders who need compliant infrastructure. If attention genuinely becomes a tradable asset class -- and the $650 billion digital advertising market suggests the underlying demand is real -- then the regulated exchange captures an enormous structural position. That's a real thesis, and the regulatory timing is legitimately favorable.

But here's where it breaks down for me. A two-person pre-seed startup pursuing DCM status is an extraordinarily capital-intensive path. This is closer to a SpaceX-scale regulatory and infrastructure challenge than a scrappy outsider story. When I wrote my first angel check into SpaceX, Elon had already proven he could execute at PayPal scale, and his intensity was unmistakable -- the biographical signal was overwhelming. I don't have that signal here. I have capable founders, but Forum needs to outrun well-funded crypto competitors while simultaneously navigating a multi-year regulatory process that requires significant legal capital they haven't yet raised. And the index manipulation risk is real and unaddressed in anything I can find publicly -- if someone can game Google Trends or coordinate social media campaigns to move the underlying indices, the entire product's integrity collapses.

What I notice that others might miss: this company doesn't create economic access for anyone. Uber created income for drivers. Affirm gave people transparent credit. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that lacked it. Forum creates a new speculative instrument for traders. That's fine as a business, but it doesn't activate the part of my thesis where I ask whether this company makes the world more equitable or makes invisible systems visible to people who need that transparency. The people who will trade attention futures are hedge funds, media companies, and crypto-native retail speculators -- not underserved populations gaining access to something they were previously locked out of. That absence matters to how I allocate my own money.

I'm passing on Forum. The founders have relevant professional backgrounds and genuine conviction -- dropping out of school to build this is meaningful. The regulatory strategy is smart and the timing is real. But the category is rapidly becoming consensus, I don't have the founder biographical signal I need to write a first check, and the company doesn't create the kind of real-world impact that drives my highest-conviction investments. If Owen called me and told me a story that connected his life to this problem in a way I couldn't ignore, I'd listen. The business logic isn't wrong. But at this stage, with my own money, I need more than business logic.
