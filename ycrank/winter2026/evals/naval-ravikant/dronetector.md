# DroneTector -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Matthew Moore spent years in a millimeter-wave radar lab at St Andrews, not studying drone detection as a market opportunity, but obsessing over the physics of how 94 GHz signals bounce off small rotating propellers. His PhD research — co-funded by QinetiQ, published in peer-reviewed radar journals — was literally the science of distinguishing a nano-drone's micro-Doppler signature from a bird's. This is specific knowledge in its purest form. You cannot train someone to have this intuition. It lives in thousands of hours of experimental validation, in the gap between simulation and real-world signal processing, in understanding which antenna architectures work at these frequencies and which don't. The CTO complements this with atomic and laser physics from Oxford — quantum-level precision in sensing. The COO brings automated reasoning for the classification layer. Three PhDs, each covering a distinct technical surface of the same problem. The founder-problem fit here is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed. Moore didn't find a hot market and build a startup around it. He found a physics problem, spent years solving it, and the market came to him via Ukraine.

The problem is leverage — or rather, the absence of it. DroneTector sells radar hardware to defense customers through direct sales. Every unit requires manufacturing, deployment, integration, and support. Revenue scales with units shipped, not with code serving millions of users. There are no network effects. There's no protocol layer. There's no marketplace dynamic where each additional participant makes the system more valuable. This is the definition of a business that grows linearly with effort. I've made hardware bets — Extropic, Atomic Semi — but those create computational leverage at the silicon layer, where one chip design serves every AI workload. A radar unit deployed at Gatwick doesn't make the radar unit deployed in Kyiv better. The only compounding path would be if the classification data from deployed units fed back into an improving AI model, but there's no evidence of that architecture in the dossier.

The timing is consensus, not contrarian. Everyone — NATO, the UK MoD, airport operators, every defense ministry in the Western world — agrees that small drone detection is urgent. The anti-drone market is growing at 25%+ CAGR. Robin Radar hit €43 million in revenue. DroneShield posted $57.5 million. Dedrone was acquired by Axon. Fortem secured a FIFA World Cup contract. This is not a space where smart people think you're wrong — it's a space where smart people and their capital are already competing aggressively. The mildly contrarian bet within the space is that millimeter-wave radar-first detection outperforms RF-sensing and multi-sensor fusion on nano drones specifically. That's a technical thesis, not a market thesis. And a technical thesis in hardware against funded competitors with hundreds of deployed units is a harder position than a technical thesis in software.

The bull case is real, and I want to articulate it honestly. If Moore's 94 GHz approach detects nano-drones that Robin Radar's lower-frequency systems genuinely miss, DroneTector owns a capability gap at the exact point where the threat is evolving. Militaries are moving toward smaller, cheaper, swarming drones — the targets keep shrinking. A radar purpose-built for the smallest class of threats could become essential as every competitor's systems hit their resolution limits. NATO DIANA and DASA participation shortcut years of defense procurement qualification, which is the single highest barrier to entry in this market. And the millimeter-wave component cost curve is dropping thanks to automotive and 5G applications, meaning DroneTector's timing on manufacturing economics may be better than it appears. If all of this aligns, a three-person team with PhD-level IP and NATO credentialing could become the acquisition target for one of the defense primes trying to fill their nano-drone detection gap. That's a real outcome — but it's an acquisition outcome, not a compounding outcome. And I optimize for compounding.

One additional concern: the CTO is also listed as co-founder and CEO of Quantum Fabrix. On a three-person team, divided attention from a key technical founder isn't a footnote — it's structural. If Quantum Fabrix is still active, DroneTector effectively has two full-time contributors. That's thin for a hardware company that needs to build radar systems, deploy them for evaluation, navigate defense procurement, and scale manufacturing simultaneously.

DroneTector is a genuine technology company solving a real, urgent problem, built by founders whose specific knowledge I deeply respect. But my framework asks for leverage, and I don't see it. This is a hardware defense business that will scale with units sold, compete on specs against funded incumbents, and likely exit via acquisition rather than compound into a platform. Important company. Not my bet.
