# Terranox AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

What catches me first about Terranox is the structural feedback loop at the center of this company: AI is driving explosive demand for electricity, which is reviving nuclear energy, which is exposing a 28% uranium supply deficit, which needs AI to solve. That kind of circular, self-reinforcing thesis — where the very technology creating the problem is also the tool to fix it — is the kind of thing that sounds either brilliant or delusional depending on who's explaining it. And two people with $500K saying they're going to be a "vertically integrated AI-powered uranium exploration company" sounds a lot like the early days of Crusoe, when a handful of people said they wanted to mine Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota. Nobody took that seriously either. The structural timing here is real: Goldman projecting $91/lb uranium, Kazatomprom cutting 20 million pounds of output guidance, U.S. exploration expenditures at their highest since 2016. The world needs uranium and has no good way to find it faster. That part resonates.

But here's where I get stuck — I don't have the story. If I were sitting across from Jade Checlair and Leeav Lipton, my first question wouldn't be about their ML architecture or the uranium supply deficit. I'd say, "Tell me how you got here. Not the business — you. What in your life led you to uranium?" And from the dossier, I can see impressive credentials: Jade has a PhD in geophysical sciences from UChicago, did research at NASA, worked nuclear and mining strategy at BCG. Leeav spent eight years building AI systems at RBC's Borealis AI lab and did remote sensing at JPL. These are genuinely relevant qualifications — the geophysics domain expertise paired with deep ML engineering is exactly the team composition this problem demands. But credentials and biographical grit are different things. I'm listening for the hardship that forged an unbreakable commitment to this specific problem, and I can't hear it through the dossier. That doesn't mean it isn't there — I just can't evaluate what I can't access, and this is my primary filter.

What I do notice, and what a typical analyst might miss, is that Terranox is trying to make an invisible system visible. Seventy years of exploration outcome data — successful and failed drilling programs, geochemical assays, geophysical surveys — is scattered across government archives, company reports, and academic papers. Nobody has systematically structured that data into something a machine can learn from. That pattern of taking opaque, fragmented information and making it transparent and actionable is the same thread that runs through Carta, Flock Safety, and Affirm in my portfolio. The uranium exploration industry is still run on legacy geological methods with low discovery rates — only 21% of mining professionals regularly use AI tools. If Terranox has genuinely aggregated a proprietary training set that includes negative examples (all the places people drilled and found nothing), that's a data asset that's hard to replicate and enormously valuable.

The anti-consensus signal here is strong. Uranium is stigmatized. Exploration is capital-intensive. Mining is heavily regulated by the NRC, EPA, and state agencies. Most seed investors would take one look at this and say it's too weird, too hard, too capital-intensive for a two-person pre-seed team. That's exactly the kind of dismissal that preceded my best investments. And Jade's BCG experience specifically in nuclear strategy suggests she understands the regulatory labyrinth — she wasn't consulting for consumer tech companies, she was in the trenches of the nuclear and mining industries. That domain familiarity in a hard, regulated space is something I've learned to value since my IronPort days.

The honest bull case is this: if the AI targeting works — if Terranox can demonstrate even a 2-3x improvement in exploration success rates — the entire uranium industry will come to them. The vertical integration model means they don't have to convince mining companies to buy software; they capture the full value of discoveries. At pre-seed, they just need to prove the concept on a few targets. They don't need to build mines. They need to show that their models identify promising geology better than geologists alone. If they do that, the capital for exploration follows — this is the kind of company where a proven concept unlocks massive follow-on from energy-focused investors, sovereign wealth funds, and uranium producers desperate for new supply. The market structure is favorable: fragmented junior explorers who can't build this, and large incumbents who are slow to adopt AI. It's a real window.

But I keep returning to the capital intensity problem and the missing biographical thread. This is a mining company with an AI layer, and mining companies need orders of magnitude more capital than software companies. KoBold needed $537M to execute this model for lithium and copper. Terranox's vertical integration aspiration at pre-seed requires a belief that they can bridge from a small data science operation to a real exploration company — and that bridge has to be built with investor money in a sector where returns take years to materialize. I'm intrigued by the weirdness, respectful of the regulatory complexity, and genuinely interested in the structural timing. But without sitting across from these founders and hearing the story that connects their lives to this mission, I can't develop the conviction I need to write a check from my own money. This is a "watch closely" for me — if the founder story is as compelling as the thesis, this could move quickly from neutral to something I'd fight to get into.
