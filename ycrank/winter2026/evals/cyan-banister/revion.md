# Revion -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Revion isn't the product or the market -- it's the distance between who these founders are and the people they're building for. Zaki came up through Morgan Stanley and Citi. Hanbo traded flow derivatives at Goldman Sachs. Felipe worked at Susquehanna. And the person they're building for is a technician lying on a creeper under a Ford F-150, grease on their hands, trying to dictate a warranty-compliant repair narrative while the service manager breathes down their neck about throughput. When I sit down with a founder, I want to hear the story that explains why THIS problem -- why it kept them up at night before they ever thought about starting a company. Nothing in this dossier gives me that thread. The domain expertise was "acquired through customer engagement," which is a polite way of saying they identified a market opportunity analytically and moved toward it. I've seen that work, but it's not the signal that makes me write a first check.

What does give me pause -- the good kind -- is the economic access angle. Service technicians are skilled tradespeople spending 30 to 40 percent of their day on administrative busywork instead of doing the work they trained for. That's the same invisible tax I saw in the taxi medallion system before Uber, the same friction Thumbtack removed for contractors. When Ewing Automotive Group says they recovered over 30,000 billable hours annually and saw a 15 percent bump in repair orders, that's real impact flowing down to the people turning wrenches. The voice-first interface -- designed for someone whose hands are literally occupied, working in a noisy bay -- is the kind of embodied insight I appreciate. Someone thought about what it actually feels like to be a technician, not just what the workflow diagram looks like on a whiteboard. And $264,000 in captured revenue from a single dealership through voice AI handling 12,000 calls shows the product delivers measurable value. For a pre-seed company, the named customers and specific metrics here are genuinely impressive execution.

But here's where my framework pushes back hard: this isn't weird. "AI-powered vertical SaaS for automotive operations" is exactly what a smart team of finance-trained founders with AI capabilities would identify through top-down market analysis. It's a good idea -- maybe even a great business -- but it's not the kind of thing other investors think is crazy. Nobody's going to tell you that voice AI for dealership service departments is insane the way they told me SpaceX was insane. The competitors tell the story: Impel has raised $126 million, Tekion sits at a $4 billion valuation, CDK Global does $2 billion in revenue. This is a crowded, well-understood space where the question isn't whether AI will transform dealership operations but which vendor captures the workflow. Revion is racing against companies with orders of magnitude more capital, more dealership relationships, and more data. The underlying technology -- voice transcription, LLM narrative generation, scheduling agents -- gets cheaper and more commoditized every quarter. That's not a moat; it's a countdown.

The strongest bull case is that Revion has the speed and focus advantage that point solutions always have against bloated incumbents. CDK Global can't sell a voice-first technician tool without admitting their existing service modules are inadequate. Tekion is building a full platform and might never prioritize the under-the-hood UX the way a dedicated team can. The nine DMS integrations already in place show execution discipline, and the UK expansion with an AM 100 Group partner suggests they can sell to enterprise dealership groups. If Hanbo's PhD-level AI research translates into meaningfully better automotive domain tuning -- better opcode matching, more accurate warranty narratives, lower hallucination rates in noisy environments -- there's a real wedge here. And the "why now" is legitimate: fixed operations became the dominant profit driver for dealerships, and LLM quality just crossed the threshold for real-time voice-to-structured-data in a workshop. If Revion captures enough workflow data across enough dealerships fast enough, the data flywheel could become the moat the technology alone won't provide.

But I keep coming back to the same question I always come back to: would I drop everything to work for these founders? And the honest answer is no -- not because they aren't smart or capable, but because I don't feel the biographical conviction that tells me these specific people will grind through the inevitable crisis points in a vertical they came to from the outside. When a DMS partner restricts API access, when an OEM changes warranty submission standards overnight, when a $4 billion competitor decides to build their feature -- the founders who survive those moments are usually the ones who have a deeply personal reason to keep going beyond the market opportunity. I don't see that here. This is a well-executed company in a real market, and someone will make money from it. But it's not my kind of bet.
