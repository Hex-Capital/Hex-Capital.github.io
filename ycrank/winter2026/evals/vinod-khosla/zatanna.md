# Zatanna -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me be direct: this is a dental billing automation company targeting a $748 million market. If Zatanna executes flawlessly — captures enormous share, builds the best AI agents in the category, automates every claim and appeal for every dental practice in America — the consequence is that dentists spend slightly less time on paperwork. That's a real pain point. It's also exactly the kind of outcome I refuse to invest in. The world doesn't operate differently. No trillion-dollar system gets displaced. Insurance companies still exist, claims still get filed, the entire infrastructure of dental billing persists — it just runs with fewer humans clicking buttons. I've seen hundreds of companies like this. Strong team, real market, working technology. And the consequence of success is a nice business, not an industry transformation. They've narrowed their scope to the point where success is manageable and irrelevant.

The competitive landscape tells you everything about the ambition level. Trust AI has already raised $6.5 million and put 8,000 dentists on its platform — and it's going after the whole practice management system, not just the billing layer. DentalRobot has been training on dental workflows for five years. Overjet sits at a $550 million valuation with $133 million raised. Pearl has FDA clearances and 150,000 practitioners. When your market already has four funded competitors and an incumbent PMS duopoly (Dentrix, Eaglesoft), you're not inventing a category. You're entering a crowded room. The experts and incumbents haven't dismissed this approach — they're actively building it. That's my clearest red flag: when established players validate the approach rather than mock it, the innovation is incremental enough to be non-threatening.

The bull case deserves serious consideration. You could argue dental is merely the wedge — that Zatanna's continuously learning EOB dataset and insurer-specific appeal generation could generalize across all healthcare billing, which is a $200+ billion ecosystem. If the "tribal knowledge" codification genuinely compounds with each practice onboarded, creating a data flywheel that makes the system meaningfully better than what any competitor or incumbent can build, and if dental-to-medical expansion proves technically feasible despite fundamentally different coding systems (CDT versus CPT/ICD-10), then the consequence magnitude jumps by two orders of magnitude. That's the Square analogy — start with small merchants, end up reshaping payments infrastructure. But Square's mobile dongle was a structural displacement of POS hardware, a 10x cost reduction that made the incumbent approach uneconomic. Zatanna automates manual processes *within* the existing insurance infrastructure. The insurance companies, the coding taxonomies, the claims adjudication systems — none of that changes. Automation within a system is categorically different from replacing the system.

The founders are early-career — recent and current undergraduates from Michigan and Wisconsin with internship experience at Coinbase, Amazon, and John Deere. No documented dental industry or healthcare billing experience, which in my framework could be a positive (outsiders unburdened by industry orthodoxy) or a negative (no deep insight into why this specific problem yields to this specific approach). The problem is I see no evidence of contrarian courage. Nobody in 2026 thinks "AI can automate administrative workflows" is a crazy thesis. The experts aren't dismissing this — they're funding it. There's no signal that these founders are attempting something the consensus considers impossible. They're executing a thesis that's already consensus, arriving after the wave has crested. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, nobody believed a New Zealander could build a commercial launch vehicle. When I backed Pat Brown, people laughed at plant-based hamburgers. What's the version of that story for dental billing automation? There isn't one — because the idea is obviously reasonable, which is precisely why four competitors are already executing it.

On timing: the LLM capability unlock is real. Before 2023, parsing insurance documentation and generating insurer-specific appeals at the quality level required was genuinely difficult. That "why now" is legitimate. But it cuts both ways — the same capability is available to every competitor, every PMS incumbent, and every well-resourced dental AI company considering an administrative expansion. When the enabling technology is a general-purpose platform (LLMs) rather than a proprietary breakthrough, the timing advantage is measured in months, not years. DentalRobot's five-year head start in dental-specific data is likely more defensible than Zatanna's 30,000 EOBs, which any competitor could assemble through a handful of practice partnerships.

I pass. These founders may be capable — I simply don't know enough about their learning rate or first-principles thinking to judge, and a factual dossier can't reveal that. But capability deployed against a problem this small, in a market this crowded, with a technology approach this accessible, doesn't meet my threshold. I'd tell them what I tell every smart team building workflow optimization: you're too talented for a problem whose success scenario is a line item in a dental practice's operating budget. Go find the version of this that replaces the insurance adjudication system entirely, or reimagines how dental care gets financed from first principles. That's a problem worth your effort.
