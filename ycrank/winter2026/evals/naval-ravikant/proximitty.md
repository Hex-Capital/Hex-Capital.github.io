# Proximitty -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me everything about the timing. Prodigal, a YC-backed company with $14.2M in funding and years of production data from real lenders, launched proAgent in 2025 -- an AI agent for consumer finance that directly overlaps with Proximitty's core thesis. LoanPro has $100M and an established API-first platform they can layer agents onto. Sedric has $22M for compliance monitoring. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal and the consensus was it couldn't work. When I invested in Bitcoin, the consensus was it was a joke. Here, the consensus is that AI agents for lending and collections are obviously valuable -- and the market is expressing that consensus with checkbooks. You don't get paid for being right when everyone else is also right.

The specific knowledge question splits this team in two. Zhang's background is the more compelling half: five years building security infrastructure at Bloomberg, and maintaining ACI.dev -- an open-source AI tool-calling platform with 4,700 GitHub stars integrating 600+ tools. That's real, non-teachable knowledge about agent orchestration and infrastructure plumbing. You can't get that from a weekend course. But it's knowledge about *how to build agents*, not knowledge about *lending and collections*. Ho's domain credentials are McKinsey business analyst and growth lead at Taptap Send, a remittances company. McKinsey teaches you to make PowerPoint decks about industries; it doesn't give you the deep operational knowledge of someone who's spent years inside a collections shop watching what actually breaks. Taptap Send is regulated fintech, which is adjacent -- but remittances and debt collections are different compliance regimes, different customer psychology, different operational cadence. The founder combination gives you strong AI infrastructure capability married to consultant-grade domain understanding. That's a meaningful gap. The collections operators who've spent a decade navigating FDCPA edge cases, managing skip-tracing workflows, and understanding borrower psychology at the interaction level -- they would bring something this team currently lacks.

The leverage test reveals incremental automation rather than a new category of capability. When Notion gave individuals the power of an entire team's toolstack, that was new leverage -- it enabled work that wasn't previously possible for one person. Proximitty is making existing collections operations faster and cheaper. That's valuable, but it's automation, not leverage creation. Collections agents using AI can reach more borrowers per hour, but the fundamental unit of work -- contacting a borrower, negotiating a resolution, ensuring compliance -- remains the same. The browser automation feature, which converts screen recordings into automated workflows via computer vision, is the most interesting leverage mechanism in the pitch, but Anthropic, OpenAI, and a dozen startups are building browser-use capabilities. That's not proprietary; it's a feature that will be table stakes within eighteen months.

The strongest bull case: if the unverified claim of serving "publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" is real, this team has achieved something extraordinary at pre-seed -- enterprise penetration in a heavily regulated industry with a two-person team. That would override most of my concerns, because it would indicate the product delivers enough value that banks are willing to bypass their usual 12-month procurement cycles. The $9-10B combined TAM is genuine, the incumbents are genuinely running on legacy batch-processing architectures, and the regulatory complexity creates real switching costs once you're embedded. If Zhang's agent infrastructure knowledge from ACI.dev gives Proximitty a deployment speed advantage -- spinning up compliant AI agents in weeks instead of months -- that could be a wedge. The path to something interesting exists. But the path runs directly through well-funded competitors who've been building lender trust and collecting production data for years. Being second with better technology rarely wins in enterprise fintech. Being first with good-enough technology usually does.

The technology surface area is the final concern. Unified data layer, voice AI agents, omni-channel outreach, real-time multi-regulation compliance monitoring, computer-vision browser automation, risk scoring models -- for a two-person team, this is either visionary ambition or a focus problem. Each of these components has dedicated competitors with specialized teams. The integration play -- combining everything into one AI-native system -- is the theoretical differentiator, but integration advantages erode as APIs improve and as larger players build or acquire the missing pieces. LoanPro with $100M can buy what they don't build. I want to see compounding technology that gets harder to replicate with each deployment. A data flywheel from borrower interactions could provide that over time, but at current scale there's no evidence it exists yet.
