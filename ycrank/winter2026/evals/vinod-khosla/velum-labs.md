# Velum Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Velum is a company that can't decide what it is. The website says "ontology engine for enterprise AI." The YC page says "open-source firewall for content-level access control." The blog says "Dynamic Data Firewall for Unstructured Data." Three different framings for the same product from a two-person team that hasn't shipped to paying customers yet. This isn't just messaging inconsistency -- it's a symptom of a deeper problem. When you don't know what you're building, you haven't found the conviction that justifies the company's existence. Every great company I've backed -- Juniper, Impossible Foods, OpenAI -- the founder could articulate in one sentence what they were doing and why it mattered. The ambiguity here suggests the founders are searching for a market rather than pursuing a problem that keeps them up at night.

Let me apply my first filter: if Velum succeeds completely -- becomes the universal content-level access control layer for every enterprise deploying AI -- what changes about the world? Companies use AI more safely. Compliance teams sleep better. The data governance market gets a better tool. That's a real business. It's not a transformation. Nobody's food system changes, no energy grid gets rebuilt, no industry becomes structurally obsolete. The cited TAM tells the story: $410 million today, $3.2 billion by 2033. Even capturing a third of that ceiling gets you a billion-dollar company. Respectable. But I don't invest for respectable -- I invest for consequences that justify the attempt. Enterprise AI compliance infrastructure is important the way plumbing is important. Nobody changes civilization with plumbing.

The competitive landscape here is the most clarifying signal. Check Point acquired Lakera. Veeam acquired Securiti. Noma Security raised $132 million and reports 1,300% ARR growth. What does this pattern tell you? It tells you incumbent security platforms view this problem as a feature to absorb, not a category to create. When Check Point buys Lakera for its prompt injection detection and bolts it onto their existing firewall platform, they're declaring that AI security is a product line, not a company. Velum is entering a market where the acqui-hire endgame is already established -- and I avoid founders who are implicitly positioning for acquisition by building in a space where acquisition is the dominant exit pattern. Two people with $500K competing against $132 million in Noma's war chest and the full weight of Check Point's enterprise sales force is not contrarian courage -- it's an asymmetric fight without the asymmetric weapon.

The bull case deserves a genuine hearing. Enterprise AI adoption is accelerating exponentially -- every company deploying agents, copilots, and RAG architectures creates data exposure vectors that traditional DLP cannot address because DLP operates at the file level, not the semantic level. If Velum's ontology-based approach genuinely understands what data *means* -- not just pattern-matching Social Security numbers but comprehending that a paragraph describes a pending acquisition -- that's a real technical leap. The open-source strategy could create a developer standard, the way Snyk captured container security. And the 2025 acquisitions removed two standalone competitors, opening space for a focused alternative. The CTO, Alen Rubilar-Muñoz, has genuine technical alignment: principal engineer at an ML PaaS, deep learning research, and a pinned GitHub repo literally called "ontology" that maps directly to the product's core. If the ontology engine becomes the semantic layer through which all enterprise AI data flows, Velum could be worth far more than the AI firewall TAM suggests -- it could be the identity layer for enterprise data itself. That's the version of this company worth investing in. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders have articulated this vision with that level of ambition, and the market is already telling them they're a feature.

On the technology itself, the dossier is honest: "The core capabilities -- NLP-based sensitive data detection, policy-based redaction, tokenization -- are individually reproducible using commodity ML models and existing PII detection libraries." The differentiation is claimed to be the ontology engine and integration layer across 50+ enterprise systems. But a two-person team claiming 50+ production-quality integrations with SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, plus SOC 2 Type II certification, strains credibility. Either these claims are aspirational or the integrations are shallow. Enterprise integration is where startups go to die slowly -- each connector requires deep domain knowledge of the target system's data model, authentication, rate limits, and edge cases. This is the kind of scope that signals founders who haven't yet felt the pain of enterprise software at scale.

The founders are technically capable -- Alen's research background in deep learning and his hackathon wins demonstrate raw ability, and Benjamin's Stanford physics training provides quantitative depth. But I see no evidence of contrarian thinking here. Enterprise AI security is consensus. Every CISO in America is asking about it. Every major security vendor is building toward it. The problem is real but the framing is conventional -- this is exactly the kind of company where the founders have identified a genuine need and are building a reasonable solution, which means they've optimized for reducing the probability of failure rather than maximizing what happens if they succeed. I'd tell these founders: the problem you're pointing at is real, but you're aiming at the compliance layer when you should be asking what happens if you control the semantic understanding of every piece of data flowing through every AI system in the enterprise. That's a different company -- and it's the one worth building.
