# Copperlane -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is how crowded this field already is. Blend announced "Intelligent Origination" AI capabilities in 2025. nCino shipped AI-driven Document Validation in October 2025. Beeline's AI agent "Bob" is expanding into processing and underwriting. When I see a two-person pre-seed startup entering a space where three well-funded incumbents with existing distribution to thousands of lenders are all shipping the same category of feature simultaneously, that's one of my strongest negative signals. The best startup ideas face little competition precisely because they're scary or invisible. "AI agents for mortgage origination" is neither scary nor invisible in 2026 -- it's consensus. It's on the cover of National Mortgage News. Every mortgage technology vendor is racing to ship it. That's not schlep blindness territory. That's a gold rush.

The question I always start with is: how did these founders find this problem? Did it grow out of something broken in their own lives, or did they sit down and try to think of startup ideas? Neither founder has any visible connection to mortgage lending. Athan Zhang's background is Princeton CS, a quant dev internship at Five Rings, MLOps at Leidos, and a medtech startup that did eye scans for brain disease detection. Alex Li appears to have been a software engineer at Chewy. Mortgage origination involves a genuine schlep -- regulatory frameworks like TILA and RESPA, integration with legacy systems built on MISMO standards, compliance with fair lending laws. It's exactly the kind of ugly, painful complexity that normally deters people. But the schlep blindness framework only generates alpha when the founders are the ones who see through it because they've been living inside it. The Collisons built Stripe because they were programmers who personally hated payment integration. Here, the founders appear to have identified mortgage origination as a large addressable market and applied their ML skills to it. That's the pattern I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas" -- technically capable people working on problems they discovered through analysis rather than experience.

The strongest bull case is that Athan Zhang is genuinely impressive for his age. He's roughly 21, attended Princeton on an accelerated CS track, interned at Five Rings (one of the most selective quant firms), and co-founded a medtech startup that raised $1.2M at a $12.5M pre-money valuation while still an undergrad. He's built an open-source agent framework with 58 GitHub stars. Both founders appear to be technical builders, which is one of my most consistent requirements -- the people in the room can actually make the product. If these two founders were working on a problem they'd personally struggled with for years, I'd pay much more attention. The mortgage schlep is real: $12,000+ per loan origination cost, document-intensive workflows, regulatory minefields that scare off casual entrants. A purpose-built agentic system designed from scratch could genuinely outperform AI features bolted onto legacy LOS platforms. If Copperlane managed to get even three or four mid-size lenders deeply integrated, the data from processing real mortgage documents could compound into something defensible.

But "could" is doing a lot of work in that paragraph. There's no evidence of any users, any revenue, any waitlist, or any signed letters of intent. The GitHub stars are for a general-purpose agent framework, not the mortgage product. No lender has publicly validated the product. I don't see evidence of the founders going door-to-door at mortgage shops, personally running document verification for loan officers, or doing any of the unscalable early work that would signal they're in the trenches understanding the problem. The co-founders have no visible shared history before this venture -- no overlapping employers, no shared university. That's another concern. And the dual naming situation (Copperlane vs. Coevolved) suggests the company may still be finding its identity, which at pre-seed can mean the idea itself is still searching for conviction.

What this adds up to: technically capable young founders who picked a trending category and are competing against incumbents with massive distribution advantages, without the organic founder-problem connection that generates the kind of deep conviction needed to survive years of painful execution in a regulated industry. The mortgage schlep is real, but identifying it from the outside and navigating it from the inside are different things entirely. I'd want to see evidence that these founders have spent serious time with loan officers, understand the regulatory landscape from direct experience rather than research, and have at least one lender pulling the product forward organically. Without those signals, this looks like a smart team that could build many things, applied to a problem they chose rather than one that chose them.
