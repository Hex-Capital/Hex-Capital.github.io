# Visibl Semiconductors -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking fact about Visibl is not the company itself — it's the competitive landscape it enters. ChipAgents has raised $74 million, deployed at 80 semiconductor companies, and reports 140x year-over-year ARR growth. Cognichip raised $33 million in seed from Lux and Mayfield. Cadence launched ChipStack AI Agent last month. Synopsys.ai already has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. When I backed Juniper in the early 1990s, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router — the incumbents were dismissive, the field was empty, and nobody else was attempting it. That asymmetry is precisely what made the bet interesting. Visibl faces the opposite situation: everyone agrees AI will transform chip design, multiple well-capitalized teams are already executing on the thesis, and the incumbents are investing billions. This is not a contrarian bet. This is a consensus market with a late entrant.

The consequence of success question here splits into two parts. If AI transforms chip design — making the path to tapeout dramatically faster, reducing verification cycles from 50% of development time to 10% — that matters. The EDA market is $15-20 billion and growing, the semiconductor industry faces a real engineer shortage, and chip complexity at advanced nodes is genuinely outpacing human coordination capacity. That's a real problem worth working on. But the question I always ask is: if *this specific company* succeeds, does it change how the world operates? Or does it become one of several AI EDA tools in a crowded market? Visibl's "AI-native IDE" framing has architectural merit — building from scratch rather than layering AI onto legacy tool suites is the right instinct, the same instinct Juniper had with clean-sheet TCP/IP routing versus Cisco's patchwork. But when four other startups and both incumbents are pursuing the same vision with 10-50x more capital and existing customer relationships, the consequence of Visibl's specific success shrinks from "industry transformation" to "another entrant that maybe captures a slice."

The CTO's credentials are exactly the kind I find uncomfortable. Jordon Kashanchi worked on Microsoft's Azure Maia custom AI silicon, interned at ARM and Intel, holds BS and MS in electrical engineering from UT Austin with an integrated circuits specialization, and has published in PNAS and ACM. That's an impressive semiconductor insider. And that's the problem. I've said many times that experience creates a set of biases that prevents you from inventing. The best EDA startups won't come from people who spent years navigating Synopsys and Cadence tool outputs — they'll come from someone who looks at the entire chip design workflow and asks why it exists in its current form at all. Kashanchi knows the pain points intimately, which is valuable for building a product that chip designers will trust. But I don't see evidence of the kind of first-principles reimagination that produces category-defining companies. The CEO, Bryce Neil, brings software and AI systems experience from Deloitte's OmniaAI — complementary, but not the outsider-attacking-a-sacred-industry pattern that excites me.

Let me steelman this. The bull case requires believing three things: first, that the "AI-native IDE" architecture is fundamentally different from ChipAgents' integration-layer approach and the incumbents' AI additions — different enough that it becomes the standard, not just an alternative. Second, that on-prem deployment and full design-context ingestion create a data and workflow moat that compounds over time, making the first few enterprise deployments into an insurmountable advantage. Third, that the semiconductor industry's extreme IP sensitivity means the market will fragment by deployment model, and Visibl's on-prem-first architecture wins the segment that matters most — the Tier-1 chip designers building the most complex, most valuable designs. If all three are true, Visibl could be the Juniper of EDA: a clean-sheet architecture that makes the incumbents' approach structurally obsolete. But that's a lot of simultaneous requirements, and I see no evidence yet that any of them are being validated. No customers, no traction signals, no demonstrations of the architecture's superiority. ChipAgents already has 80 customers proving market demand — Visibl has a website and a demo scheduling form.

The timing question crystallizes my concern. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, nobody was writing $50 million checks into AI companies. The technology trajectory was clear to me — model improvement rates and talent flow — but the market hadn't arrived yet. That four-year head start before consensus was the entire advantage. AI for chip design became consensus in 2024-2025. The wave of funding — ChipAgents, Cognichip, Chipmind, Maieutic — all landed before Visibl entered YC. Building a two-person pre-seed company into a consensus market where competitors have $74 million and 80 production customers is not skating to where the puck will be. It's arriving after the game started. I fund companies that are building before the technology is ready but after the trajectory is clear. Visibl is building after both the technology and the market are clear — and after others have already captured the early advantage.

This is a capable team working on a legitimate problem in a real market. But it has none of the signals that activate my framework: no contrarian angle, no outsider perspective, no timing advantage, no evidence of the kind of ambition that would justify entering a market this well-funded this late. The founders haven't reduced their probability of failure — they face enormous competitive risk — but they also haven't calibrated their ambition to the scale where success would justify that risk. Building a better AI EDA tool when ChipAgents has 80 customers and $74 million is not a bet on transformational consequence. It's a bet on execution in a competitive market. I fund the former, not the latter.
