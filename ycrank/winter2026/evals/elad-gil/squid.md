# Squid -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Grid planning software is exactly the kind of market that makes most investors' eyes glaze over. Distribution system operators managing substations and power lines with spreadsheets and legacy desktop tools -- this sounds like the IT department's problem, not a venture-scale opportunity. That reaction is the signal. When I invested in PagerDuty, the most common response I got was "who funds alerting software?" But operations alerting turned out to be critical infrastructure for every company running software. Squid is targeting the same archetype: "boring but critical" planning infrastructure that every grid operator needs, at the exact moment when the grid itself is undergoing the most fundamental structural change in a century.

The structural moment here is specific and compounding. AI data center demand is projected to nearly triple electricity consumption. EV adoption is adding distributed load. Heat pumps, rooftop solar, and battery storage are making the grid bidirectional for the first time. Electricity rates jumped 13% in 2025 in the US alone. Legacy planning tools -- PSS/E from Siemens, Synergi from DNV, CYME from Eaton -- were architected for a centralized, slow-changing grid where one engineer could model the local network on a desktop application and update plans annually. That world is ending. The decentralized, bidirectional grid with flexibility markets demands collaborative, continuous planning across multiple stakeholder teams. National Grid DSO's FlexPortal launch -- literally powered by Squid -- with their Head of Flexibility Markets saying "for too long flex data lived in spreadsheets" is not a pitch deck claim, it's a publicly shipped product demonstrating the structural need. The incumbents face a classic business model trap: their perpetual desktop license revenue would be cannibalized by a move to browser-native SaaS, and rebuilding decades-old desktop applications for the cloud is a multi-year engineering project. Meanwhile, Envelio -- the closest modern competitor -- was acquired by E.ON in 2023, which effectively neutralizes it as a platform for E.ON's competitors. That's a structural opening.

What I find most compelling about the founding team is the pattern of domain-insider founders on their second attempt. George Kolokotronis previously co-founded VoltQuant, a geospatial grid intelligence startup that had National Grid as a customer. He then became Head of Technology at Octopus Energy. He's not entering the energy sector because it's trending -- he's been building grid software for years, with the same customers he's now selling to at Squid. Conor Jones worked at both National Grid and Octopus Energy before BCG. These founders know the procurement process, the data formats, the regulatory requirements, and -- critically -- the actual people who sign utility software contracts. The fact that a two-person pre-seed team has already achieved SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification tells me they understand that compliance is the table stakes for selling to regulated utilities, not an afterthought. This is the pattern I've seen at Color Health, where we had to build CLIA-compliant lab infrastructure before we could sell a single genetic test. Regulatory complexity deters most software investors. It should attract them.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is where this gets interesting beyond a single-product story. If Squid becomes the versioned network model of record -- the single source of truth for how a utility understands its grid -- then it becomes the distribution channel for everything built on top of that model: scenario planning, flexibility procurement, connection assessment, asset strategy, compliance reporting. The FlexPortal partnership already demonstrates this: National Grid DSO is using Squid's platform to power a flexibility markets portal, which is a different application layer built on the same core network model. That's the Gusto pattern -- become the system of record for payroll, then distribute HR, benefits, and compliance through the same relationship. It's also reminiscent of how Figma's collaborative canvas became the distribution channel for FigJam and developer handoff. The question is whether grid operators will consolidate on a single model of record or continue using fragmented tools. The structural pressure is toward consolidation -- you can't plan a bidirectional grid across stakeholder teams without a shared model.

The concerns are real but navigable. Utility enterprise sales cycles are long -- often 12+ months -- and a two-person team burning through a pre-seed round while waiting for procurement approvals is a legitimate risk. Neara's $90M Series D at a $1.1B valuation shows venture capital flooding into adjacent grid software, and while Neara focuses on digital twins and asset management rather than collaborative planning, well-funded adjacent competitors can expand. The UK-to-US market translation adds complexity, though I'd argue the UK is actually ahead on grid decentralization and flexibility markets, meaning Squid is building for the harder use case first. When US utilities catch up -- and data center demand is accelerating that timeline -- a product battle-tested on UK grid complexity will have a meaningful head start. The "AI-powered" positioning is the weakest element of the pitch -- it's vague about what AI specifically does in the planning workflow versus what's traditional grid modeling software. But the core value proposition doesn't depend on an AI miracle; the collaborative browser-native workspace solves the coordination problem regardless of how much AI is involved.

The single miracle here is enterprise adoption: getting conservative utility buyers to replace entrenched desktop workflows with a browser-native system of record. That's hard, but it's one miracle, not three. The technology works -- browser-based collaborative tools are proven in other verticals. The market demand is structural, not speculative. And the team has the relationships to execute on exactly this adoption challenge. If I'm wrong about this company, it'll be because utility procurement cycles are even slower than expected, not because the thesis is wrong. The market is moving -- the only question is how fast Squid can capture it.
