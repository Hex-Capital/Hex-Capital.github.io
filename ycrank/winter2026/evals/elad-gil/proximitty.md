# Proximitty -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Loan servicing and collections is exactly the kind of market that triggers dismissive reactions from most investors -- it sounds unglamorous, the buyers are conservative, and the regulatory burden is enormous. That's the pattern I pay attention to. PagerDuty was "just alerting." Gusto was "just payroll." Collections software is "just calling people who owe money." But every financial institution that extends credit needs it, the regulatory burden is increasing (CFPB Regulation F, TCPA, FDCPA, SCRA, plus state-level rules), and the structural moment is real: voice AI crossed the production-quality threshold for nuanced, regulation-sensitive conversations sometime in 2024. Two years ago, you could not build an autonomous agent that reliably handled a collections call within FDCPA constraints. Now you can. That capability inflection, combined with BNPL portfolio growth flooding collections pipelines with volume that manual agents can't absorb, creates a genuine "why now" -- not a slide deck "why now" but an operational one.

The problem is that this structural moment is no longer hidden. Prodigal, a YC-backed company with $14.2M and existing lender relationships, launched proAgent in 2025 -- an AI agent for consumer finance that directly overlaps with Proximitty's core offering. Sedric raised $22M for compliance monitoring. LoanPro has $100M and an installed base of lending clients. When I invested in Harvey, legal AI genuinely looked impossible to most investors because GPT-3 wasn't accurate enough. Collections AI in 2026 doesn't look impossible -- it looks like an active category with funded players converging on similar approaches. The market is boring, but the AI-for-collections thesis is increasingly consensus among fintech-focused investors. That shifts this from a non-obvious market to a "seems boring but actually competitive" market, which is a meaningfully different risk profile.

My bigger concern is the multi-miracle problem. Proximitty's product surface area spans a unified lending data layer, voice AI agents, omni-channel collections agents, real-time compliance monitoring across six-plus regulatory frameworks, risk scoring models, and computer-vision browser automation for no-code workflow creation. Each of these is a substantial engineering challenge. For a two-person team, building production-quality versions of all six components while simultaneously navigating 6-18 month enterprise sales cycles at regulated financial institutions is not one miracle -- it's four or five. You could argue the single miracle is "achieving compliance-grade accuracy in autonomous borrower communications" and that everything else is standard engineering. But the breadth of the product claims on the website suggests the founders haven't made that prioritization call yet. When I ask "what's the one thing that has to work?" I want to hear one sentence, not a platform overview.

The bull case is compelling enough to articulate: if Proximitty becomes the unified data layer for a lender's servicing and collections operations, the switching costs become material and the platform becomes a distribution channel for additional products -- risk analytics, compliance reporting, borrower intelligence, workout strategy optimization. That's the Stripe pattern: own the integration, then distribute adjacent products through it. The CTO's background directly supports this architecture -- Zi Zhang built ACI.dev, an open-source tool-calling platform for AI agents with 4,700 GitHub stars and 30 contributors. That's not a weekend project; it's demonstrated ability to build production AI agent infrastructure that other developers adopt. Combined with Ho's fintech growth experience at Taptap Send (a regulated money transfer company) and McKinsey consulting, the founder-market fit is genuinely strong. If these two can land even two or three mid-size lender deployments and prove that autonomous agents can handle collections interactions without compliance incidents, the data flywheel and integration depth create real defensibility.

But the claim of being "trusted by publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" without naming a single customer is a yellow flag in my framework. Founders who are landing enterprise deals name them -- or at minimum say "three Fortune 500 financial institutions" with specificity. The vagueness suggests either very early pilot conversations being characterized as trust relationships, or NDA-restricted logos that would be more credibly communicated. Either way, it reduces my confidence in traction claims that I can't verify. The absence of any independent revenue data, LinkedIn company page, or press coverage reinforces this.

I'd want to see Proximitty narrow its product scope, identify the one miracle it's uniquely solving (compliance-grade autonomous collections seems like the right candidate), and demonstrate at least one production deployment before I'd write a check. The market structure rewards the approach, the founders have relevant backgrounds, and the timing is right -- but the competitive landscape has progressed further than the team's visible traction, and the product scope suggests a team trying to build a platform before validating a wedge.
