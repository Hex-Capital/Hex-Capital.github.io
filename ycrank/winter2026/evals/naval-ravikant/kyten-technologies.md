# Kyten Technologies -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The specific knowledge here is real. Six to seven years building battery packs at Starlink isn't a credential you list on a resume -- it's the kind of knowledge that lives in your hands and your failure logs. McBride and Maddox put 5,000-6,000 packs into low earth orbit. That means they've seen every thermal failure mode, every vibration-induced weld fracture, every cell-level anomaly that only manifests after launch. You cannot acquire this in a classroom, a bootcamp, or six months of industry research. When I backed the Notion founders, the signal was years of genuine obsession with how tools shape thought. Here the signal is years inside arguably the highest-rate aerospace production environment in history. These founders know things about battery pack manufacturing at scale that perhaps a few hundred people on Earth understand. That clears my first filter decisively.

The structural question is leverage -- and this is where Kyten becomes a harder call for me. Battery pack manufacturing is atoms, not bits. Every pack requires cells, bus bars, thermal management hardware, BMS boards, and human or robotic assembly time. You don't get the 1,000x multiplier of code or media leverage. The "automated software-defined test and manufacturing systems" language on the website hints at a SpaceX-style approach -- encoding manufacturing knowledge into software that controls the production line -- and that is a form of leverage I find interesting. It's how Tesla disrupted automotive: not by building a better car, but by building a better factory. If Kyten's actual competitive advantage is a software-controlled manufacturing process that compresses timelines 25-50x (one week versus six months per phase), then the leverage is in the process, not the product. But the dossier provides no evidence this software system exists yet versus being aspirational. And the core business remains: build physical thing, ship physical thing, build next physical thing. My portfolio is dominated by platforms and infrastructure where one engineer's work serves millions. This is closer to Opendoor than to Replit -- a capital-intensive operation where the technology creates a qualitative speed advantage but doesn't fundamentally change the input-output ratio.

The timing is interesting but not contrarian in the way I typically require. NDAA Section 842 and the FCC Covered List are public regulatory catalysts. Every defense-focused VC can read the Federal Register. The consensus view is already forming: "domestic battery supply chain is a national security priority." That's not a secret -- it's a PowerPoint slide at every defense tech conference. Where I see a modest contrarian angle is in the *how*: most people look at domestic aerospace battery manufacturing and think you need EaglePicher's 180 years of heritage and Tuthill Corporation's balance sheet. The bet that two SpaceX engineers can compress aerospace-grade pack development from months to weeks using software-defined manufacturing -- that specific claim is non-consensus. Smart defense procurement people would say it's impossible because MIL-STD qualification inherently takes months. If Kyten has genuinely found a way to parallelize or accelerate that process based on what they learned at Starlink's production cadence, they're right where the consensus is wrong.

The bull case deserves serious consideration. If I force myself to articulate why this could be a defining company: aerospace battery packs are picks-and-shovels for the drone and satellite revolution. Every Anduril drone, every SpaceX competitor, every eVTOL aircraft needs custom packs. The regulatory moat is real and getting deeper -- NDAA compliance isn't a feature you bolt on, it's a structural requirement that eliminates most of the global supply base. Qualification switching costs in aerospace are enormous -- once a customer qualifies your pack design for their platform, switching costs them millions in re-qualification. If Kyten achieves even a fraction of its speed claims, they become the default choice for any US aerospace company under time pressure, which is all of them. The founders' SpaceX network gives them warm intros to exactly the right first customers. This is the Alchemy play applied to aerospace hardware: become the default infrastructure layer that every builder in the ecosystem depends on. That path exists.

But I keep coming back to the leverage architecture. My best investments -- AngelList, Notion, Replit, Stack Overflow -- create forms of leverage where the marginal cost of serving the next user approaches zero. Kyten's marginal cost of serving the next customer is a factory expansion. The capital intensity is severe: scaling from two people to a production facility capable of serving multiple aerospace OEMs requires tens of millions in equipment, facility buildout, ITAR-compliant security infrastructure, and cell inventory. The $500K YC check is seed money for a seed company -- they'll need defense-tech-scale follow-on funding, and that changes the return dynamics significantly. This is a company I'd want to watch rather than fund at this stage. Let the manufacturing process prove itself with two or three paying customers. Let the "one week" qualification claim get validated by an actual defense program. The specific knowledge is undeniable, the market timing is favorable, but the business model fights against the leverage mechanics that define my highest-conviction investments.

One note on the technical founder question: both founders are EE-trained hardware engineers, which is the right background for this company. But the "automated software-defined test and manufacturing" systems they reference -- who builds the software? No GitHub presence, no software engineering background visible. If this manufacturing process advantage is real, it's encoded in software, and I'd want to know who's writing it. The absence of a visible software builder on the team is a gap worth probing, not a disqualifier.
