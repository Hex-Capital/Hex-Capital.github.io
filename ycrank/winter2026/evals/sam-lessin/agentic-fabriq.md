# Agentic Fabriq -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

"Okta for Agents" might be the single most consensus pitch in enterprise tech right now. When I see that tagline, my first question isn't "is this a real need" -- obviously agents need permission management, Microsoft themselves published that 90% of agents are over-permissioned. My question is: who doesn't already know this? Okta shipped Auth for GenAI in October 2025. They announced the Cross App Access protocol a month before that. CrowdStrike just paid $740 million for SGNL. Oasis raised $75 million from Sequoia and Accel. Astrix raised $85 million. Over $200 million in dedicated startup funding has flowed into non-human identity and agent security, and every major security platform is converging on this exact problem. When I say I look for a sane person with an insane idea, the critical word is *insane* -- the idea has to provoke genuine skepticism from most investors. "Agents need identity management" provokes head-nodding, not skepticism. This is the opposite of my filter. It's a sane idea being pursued by everyone simultaneously.

The founder pairing compounds the problem rather than resolving it. Paulina and Matthew Xu are clearly intelligent -- MIT AI and physics research at Kavli, Haystack Observatory, CSAIL -- and dropping out at 19 shows conviction. But "sane" in my framework means credibility specific to the problem you're attacking. Enterprise security sales to IT admins and CISOs is one of the most relationship-driven, trust-intensive markets in tech. These founders have ML research backgrounds, not enterprise security scars. They've never sold a security product to a Fortune 500 company, never navigated a SOC 2 audit, never built an integration that had to survive a CISO review. Compare this to Scott Kriz at SGNL, who had a prior exit to Google before attacking identity governance and still needed to sell to CrowdStrike rather than go it alone. Two 19-year-old MIT dropouts with $500K against Okta's distribution machine and $200 million in competing startup capital -- the credibility gap isn't a gap, it's a canyon.

My structural moat analysis makes this worse, not better. This is pure software -- OAuth delegation, policy engines, audit logging, connectors. Every component is a well-understood building block. There is no physical infrastructure, no regulatory moat, no proprietary data asset, no protocol-layer lock-in. The dossier's own risk section acknowledges that "the underlying technical components are well-understood building blocks that multiple teams could assemble." This is the exact category I've been arguing is dissolving: SaaS tools whose moats evaporate as software gets cheaper to build. The inferred switching costs from configured policies are real but thin -- the same argument every enterprise SaaS company makes, and the same argument that's proving insufficient as AI makes it trivial to rebuild integrations. More fundamentally, this business has zero independent existence without AI. Remove the AI wave and there is no company. That's the definitional failure of my "cherry on top" test -- this isn't a great business that AI makes better, it's a feature of the AI ecosystem that will get absorbed by whichever platform controls the identity layer.

The strongest bull case -- and I want to engage with it honestly -- is that employee-scoped agent permissions represent a genuinely new primitive. The delegation chain of human-to-agent-to-tool, where the agent's permissions are dynamically scoped to the specific employee's clearance level, is architecturally different from traditional IAM. If Agentic Fabriq could establish this as a new standard or protocol that other platforms integrate with, the compounding dynamics could be real. SGNL's $740 million exit proves there's enormous value in adjacent identity infrastructure. And the timing urgency is legitimate -- 40% of enterprise apps projected to embed agents by end of 2026, up from 5% in early 2025. But here's what kills the primitive argument: Okta's XAA protocol is the actual protocol-layer play. Okta is defining the standard. Agentic Fabriq is building an application on top of that standard. When I invested in Venmo, peer-to-peer mobile payments were a new primitive nobody else was building. When I backed Aleo, zero-knowledge privacy protocols were dismissed as academic by mainstream VCs. "Agent permissions" is a primitive that the incumbent is already claiming at the protocol layer, which pushes Agentic Fabriq into application territory against a platform with overwhelming distribution.

I'd rather fund a painting company with a scheduling algorithm than a security startup with a pitch deck in the hottest consensus category in enterprise. The founders are smart. The problem is real. But every signal in my framework points the same direction: consensus idea, pure SaaS moat, application-layer position against an incumbent building the protocol, no revenue cushion, and founders whose technical strength doesn't map to the specific go-to-market hell of enterprise security sales. Pass.
