# Inviscid AI -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most telling detail in this dossier isn't what Inviscid AI is building -- it's what they chose not to build. You have a technology that claims to accelerate computational fluid dynamics by 1000x. A thousand times faster. If that's real, you could simulate nuclear reactor cooling in real time. You could model atmospheric dynamics for climate prediction. You could redesign jet engines or optimize fusion plasma containment. These are problems where a 1000x speedup in physics simulation changes what humanity can attempt. Instead, these founders applied it to making office building air conditioning slightly more efficient. They took a potentially transformational capability and pointed it at a problem where the consequence of full success is that some facilities manager saves 20-40% on his energy bill. That's the pattern I warn people about most aggressively: calibrating your ambition to minimize failure rather than maximize the consequence of success.

The competitive landscape confirms this is consensus, not contrarian. PassiveLogic has $125 million and is already building physics-based digital twins for building autonomy with Johnson Controls as an investor. PhysicsX has $170 million applying similar physics-AI to engineering simulation with NVIDIA backing. BrainBox AI was acquired by Trane Technologies in December 2024, giving a data-driven HVAC optimizer access to a global distribution network a two-person startup will never match. 75F has 1,800 deployments across nine countries. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing was impossible and nobody in telecom wanted it. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry thought plant-based meat was a joke. The signal I look for is experts dismissing the idea. Here, the experts aren't dismissing the idea -- they're already executing it with a hundred times more capital. Arriving after $400 million in competitor funding has validated your category is not outsider courage; it's showing up to a race that's already half over.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Data center construction is surging because of AI workloads, and cooling represents 30-40% of total energy costs. If Inviscid AI became the physics simulation layer underlying every new data center's thermal design, the consequence magnitude rises substantially. The founders are genuine outsiders -- a 19-year-old IOAI gold medalist and a PhD ML researcher, neither from the building industry. That's the pattern I've profited from with Peter Beck at Rocket Lab: someone who didn't know what the industry considered impossible, freeing them to attempt it. And physics-informed neural networks are on an accelerating improvement curve, sitting at the intersection of two exponential trends -- ML capability and energy cost pressure. If you squint, there's a version of this company that becomes the simulation infrastructure layer for all physical systems, not just buildings. But that company would need to articulate that ambition, and what I see instead is a startup focused on HVAC vent optimization with unnamed case studies spanning coastal infrastructure and storm surge forecasting -- a technology searching for a market, not a founder possessed by a problem too important not to work on.

The team composition reveals the gap most starkly. Two ML specialists with no documented building science, HVAC engineering, or enterprise sales experience. Gene pool engineering means identifying your top five risks and recruiting specifically to address them. Risk one for this company is domain credibility with facilities managers who've spent thirty years operating building systems. Risk two is enterprise sales cycles that require on-site integration with BMS infrastructure using BACnet and Modbus protocols. The founding team addresses neither. The case studies don't name customers, and two of three aren't even in the stated target market of buildings. I spend more time helping portfolio companies recruit than any other activity because team composition determines whether a technology can become a business. Here, the technology talent is real -- an IOAI gold medal at 19 is not trivial, and a PhD in ML from NYU is legitimate -- but it's unaccompanied by anyone who can translate that capability into something a building operator will buy.

I pass on this. Not because the technology is bad -- physics-informed neural networks accelerating CFD is genuinely interesting science. But because the founders have aimed this technology at a problem where success produces a nice business in a crowded market, not an industry transformation. The $1.09 billion TAM for AI HVAC tuners tells the whole story: they're optimizing an existing system, not replacing it. If these founders came to me and said they wanted to use 1000x faster physics simulation to make nuclear fusion reactors designable in days instead of years, or to simulate climate interventions at planetary scale, or to redesign how we engineer every physical system from scratch -- I'd write the check despite the team gaps because the consequence would justify the risk. But better air conditioning? That's a problem worth solving, not a problem worth sacrificing everything for.
