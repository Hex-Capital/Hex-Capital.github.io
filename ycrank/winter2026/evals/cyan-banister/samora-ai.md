# Samora AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Kartik Sawhney's story stopped me before I even looked at the product. Here's a teenager in India -- blind -- who was told by the entire educational system that he couldn't study science. Not that it would be hard. That it was literally not allowed. And instead of accepting that, he changed national policy, went to Stanford, ran Microsoft's $25M AI for Accessibility program, and built tools that reached 25,000 people with disabilities across 80 countries. Now he's building voice agents that work in the languages and dialects that every well-funded Silicon Valley competitor has decided aren't worth the effort. That biographical thread -- from a kid who was excluded by the system to a founder building technology for populations that Big Tech systematically ignores -- is exactly the kind of founder-problem fusion I spend my career looking for. This isn't someone who pivoted to voice AI because it's the hot category of 2025. This is someone whose entire life has been about making technology work for people the world overlooks, and voice AI is where that mission finally has a massive commercial expression.

And here's what I think a lot of investors will miss: Samora isn't really competing with Vapi or Bland AI. Those companies are building developer infrastructure for American enterprises. Samora is building managed voice operations for the Government of India and UNICEF -- organizations that need calls handled in Hindi dialects, Arabic code-switching, and languages that don't have clean training data sitting in some OpenAI dataset. The UNICEF testimonial about reaching beneficiaries with limited connectivity through native language support -- that's not a feature request you hear from a Fortune 500 company in San Francisco. That's a fundamentally different customer with fundamentally different needs, and Kartik's years of institutional relationships through I-Stem give him access to those customers in a way that no amount of VC funding can replicate for a competitor starting cold.

The economic access dimension here is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed. When I backed Uber, part of what excited me was that it created income for drivers -- it was a poverty-alleviation mechanism disguised as a logistics company. Samora has a similar quality. Voice AI that actually works in local dialects doesn't just make call centers more efficient -- it makes government services, healthcare outreach, and humanitarian aid accessible to populations who've been excluded by the language barrier of technology itself. The fact that Kartik arrived at this through lived experience with exclusion, not through market analysis, is exactly the signal I weight most heavily.

But I have to be honest about what gives me pause: voice AI is one of the most consensus categories in tech right now. PolyAI has raised $200M+. Bland AI just closed $65M. Vapi, Synthflow, Retell -- everyone is building voice agents. That's the opposite of the unpopular, difficult-to-assess profile I gravitate toward. When I backed SpaceX or Crusoe Energy, nobody else wanted in. Here, billions of dollars are flooding the category. Even if Samora's specific niche -- multilingual emerging markets -- is less contested today, any of these well-funded competitors could decide to expand language support tomorrow. The moat from 1M+ multilingual calls is real but early, and the underlying LLM and speech technologies are commoditizing fast enough that dialect support won't stay exotic forever.

The co-founder dynamics give me real comfort. All three founders worked together at I-Stem for years -- Kartik as co-founder, Vineeth as Head of Engineering, Shakul in operations. That's a battle-tested team, not strangers assembled around a pitch deck. After what I learned from HQ Trivia about how even perfectly timed products die from founder conflict, I always probe this dimension hard, and the I-Stem working relationship is one of the stronger pre-existing bonds I've seen. Eight people, YC W26, already processing over a million calls with Government of India and UNICEF as named customers -- that's real execution.

The bull case is that Samora occupies a position nobody else is fighting for yet: the fully managed voice operations layer for institutional customers in emerging markets. The big competitors are all selling developer tools to US enterprises. The revenue question (that $1.1M Getlatka figure is unreliable -- I'd want to verify it directly) and the emerging-market monetization challenge are real concerns. Governments and NGOs pay less than American SaaS companies. But if Kartik can nail the unit economics and use institutional deployments to build a dialect-level data flywheel that nobody else has, the managed service model in markets where 4 billion people don't speak English as their primary language is an enormous opportunity that the consensus players are structurally disinclined to pursue. I'd want to sit with Kartik and understand the revenue picture and path to commercial sustainability before writing a check, but the founder and the mission pull me forward.
