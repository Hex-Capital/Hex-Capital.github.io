# RunAnywhere -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The schlep here is real but it's the wrong kind. Cross-platform on-device AI deployment is genuinely painful -- different runtimes, model formats, memory constraints across iOS, Android, web, and edge hardware. Any developer who has tried to ship the same model to a phone and a browser knows this. That qualifies as a schlep. But it's a technical schlep, not an operational one. Technical schleps get solved by big engineering organizations as a matter of routine. Meta built ExecuTorch and it already powers on-device AI across Instagram, WhatsApp, and Ray-Ban glasses for billions of users. Google shipped MediaPipe. Apple shipped MLX. These companies eat cross-platform runtime problems for breakfast. The schlep that would actually protect a startup in this space is the enterprise operational schlep -- managing model rollouts across heterogeneous device fleets, policy-based routing, compliance workflows, A/B testing at scale. RunAnywhere's control plane targets exactly this. But I see no evidence the founders discovered that enterprise need through lived experience. It reads like an architectural decision about where to place the paywall, not an organic discovery about what enterprises desperately need.

The origin question is what concerns me most. How did Sanchit and Shubham find this problem? Sanchit was a software engineer at Intuit. Shubham worked on distributed systems at AWS. Both graduated from RIT. The company was founded in 2025, precisely when on-device AI became the hot category after small-parameter models like Llama 3.2 and Phi-3 crossed the quality threshold. Nothing in the dossier suggests either founder was personally struggling with on-device deployment before deciding to start a company. The timing pattern -- AI is hot, tooling is fragmented, let's build infrastructure -- is the pattern I've warned about for twenty years. Smart engineers notice a trend, identify a gap, and build toward it. The market is large. The technology works. But if you asked these founders "would you have built this product even if you weren't starting a startup?" I suspect the honest answer reveals the idea was constructed rather than discovered.

The strongest counterargument is that the developer community is voting with their stars. Nine thousand GitHub stars on an open-source SDK in under a year, from a two-person team, is not nothing. That's organic developer attention flowing toward the project. And the breadth of platform coverage -- iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, web, wearables -- represents serious engineering output from two people who are clearly building the product themselves. Both founders are writing code. Sixteen hundred commits on the SDK repo. Demo apps live on both app stores. This is not a PowerPoint company. If RunAnywhere can convert even a fraction of those developers into enterprise control plane customers as their on-device deployments scale, the business could work. The structural argument that Meta and Google won't build a commercial fleet management SaaS -- because it would cannibalize their cloud inference revenue -- has some logic to it. Docker won despite Linux containers being technically reproducible, because the developer experience layer became the standard.

But Docker didn't face three incumbents each giving away their own container runtime optimized for their own ecosystem. The competitive landscape here is more crowded than fragmented. Nexa AI already has $3.4M in revenue and a 31-person team with over $8M raised. That's a funded, revenue-generating competitor with a two-year head start in the same space. When I look at the companies that succeeded from YC against well-funded incumbents -- Stripe against PayPal's Braintree, Dropbox against Box -- the founders had an almost irrational connection to the problem that sustained them through years of painful competition. I don't see that irrational connection here.

The founders are technically competent. They ship code. The problem they've chosen is real and growing. If I squint, I can see a path where on-device AI becomes as fundamental as cloud computing, and RunAnywhere becomes the control plane that ties it all together. But the idea feels assembled from components -- trending market plus open-source SDK plus enterprise control plane monetization -- rather than grown from the founders' own frustration. The best developer infrastructure companies I've funded started because a programmer couldn't stand using the existing tools one more day. I'd want to hear the founders describe the specific moment they personally hit this wall, not as a pitch narrative, but as something they genuinely couldn't stop thinking about. Until I hear that story, this looks like a competent team building in a hot category, and those are exactly the companies that raise money but struggle when the multi-year grind of enterprise sales and big-tech competition sets in.
