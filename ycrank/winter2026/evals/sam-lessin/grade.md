# Grade -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The thing that jumps out about Grade isn't the founders or the product — it's the competitive landscape. Lumanu has raised $20.6 million. Stir raised $20.7 million at a $100 million valuation with Andreessen Horowitz leading. MONET pulled in €17 million. Tipalti processes $75 billion in annualized payment volume and has $200 million-plus in ARR. And here's Grade, a two-person pre-seed team entering this exact market with the thesis that "payroll for performance" is an unoccupied category. When a market has this many well-funded players in adjacent positions, and the core differentiator is "we natively bundle performance tracking with payments" — that's not a non-consensus bet. That's a consensus opportunity where the only question is who executes fastest. I don't invest in footraces against runners who already have a three-year head start and ten times the capital.

The sane-person-insane-idea filter doesn't activate here. Lotanna and James are clearly competent — multiple creator economy ventures, some exits (small ones through Acquire.com, plus a crypto startup sale at 22), and James demonstrated real building velocity getting Pray Screen to $40K MRR in two months. They've got genuine creator economy pattern recognition from operating Creator Check and XPO. That's the "sane" component. But the "insane" component is missing entirely. Performance-based creator payments is the obvious next step in a market that Goldman Sachs has sized at $250 billion and every fintech newsletter has been writing about for three years. When I backed Venmo, nobody understood why you'd need to text money to friends. When I describe Grade to someone — "companies need to pay creators based on performance metrics across countries" — the universal response is "yeah, that makes sense." That's a problem. The best investments provoke genuine skepticism, not nodding agreement.

My structural moat alarm is loud here. This is a software workflow tool that sits on top of commoditized payment rails — Stripe, Wise, whatever they're using underneath. The differentiated layer is business logic: tracking creator performance, calculating variable compensation, generating consolidated invoices. That is precisely the kind of software layer that gets commoditized fastest as AI makes development cheaper. A reasonably competent engineer with access to Claude and Stripe's API could build 80% of this in a couple weeks. The 190-country tax compliance creates some switching costs, sure — nobody wants to re-collect W-8BEN forms. But Tipalti already handles global tax compliance at massive scale across 196 countries. The compliance moat is already someone else's feature. Grade isn't a painting company with a tech layer. It's a tech company whose entire moat is the tech layer — and that's the category I keep saying AI is going to eat alive.

The strongest bull case deserves honest engagement. If performance-based creator compensation becomes the dominant model — and the trend data supports this, with creator economy ad spend projected at $37 billion in 2025 growing at 4x the media industry — then the company that owns the workflow connecting campaign metrics to payment execution could become genuinely infrastructural. Imagine Grade's API becoming the standard integration point: ad platforms push performance data in, payment rails push money out, and Grade sits in the middle as the canonical record of who earned what across every campaign. That's a protocol-position story. And the $380K in monthly payout volume with 120% month-over-month growth is real signal — these aren't vanity metrics, it's actual money moving through the system. If they're taking even a modest 5-8% rake, that's meaningful pre-seed revenue. But for this bull case to work, they'd need to outrun Lumanu (which already has nine-figure annualized payment volume and is adding features aggressively), avoid getting absorbed by Tipalti (which would view this as a vertical template), and establish themselves as the standard before Stir or MONET expand laterally. That's three simultaneous execution miracles required, and I've learned — painfully, from Birchbox — that narrative magnitude without defensible structure produces the worst possible venture outcome: a company too successful to die quickly but too fragile to compound.

The narrative ceiling is visible from here. "Payroll for the creator economy" is a solid story, but it's a workflow category, not an infinite one. It doesn't expand the way Helium's narrative grew from "IoT hotspots" to "decentralized wireless infrastructure," or the way Solana's narrative expanded from "fast blockchain" to "new financial operating system." Grade's expansion story — from performance-based payouts to maybe invoicing, maybe creator banking, maybe campaign analytics — runs directly into the roadmaps of four well-funded competitors already pursuing the exact same expansion logic. This isn't an infinity story. It's a race to build the most complete feature set in a defined vertical, and that race typically rewards the best-capitalized player, not the most elegant product.
