# Zatanna -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Zatanna is the competitive timing. DentalRobot has been training on dental workflows for five years. Trust AI already has 8,000 dentists on its platform and $6.5 million in seed funding. Overjet has $133 million and a $550 million valuation. These aren't hypothetical future competitors -- they're entrenched and funded. Schlep blindness only works as a competitive advantage when you're the first to walk into the ugly problem nobody else wants to touch. Dental billing automation is no longer a problem hiding in plain sight. Multiple well-resourced teams have already seen it. When you arrive at a schlep that's already being worked on by a company with five years of training data, you don't have the structural protection that made Stripe's position so powerful. The Collisons walked into payments when nobody else would. These founders are walking into dental RCM when several others already have.

The deeper problem is the origin story -- or rather, the absence of one. How did three recent college graduates from CS and data science programs find dental billing? None of the founders have publicly documented any dental industry or healthcare billing experience. Rithvik Vanga comes from Michigan CS with stints at Coinbase and Hamming AI. Tarun Vedula studied data science at Wisconsin-Madison and worked at Amazon. Alex Blackwell was at Pikkit, a sports betting analytics platform. These are smart, technically trained people. But dental billing is a domain where the critical knowledge -- which insurer rejects which codes, how to construct an appeal that actually gets paid, why a specific EOB is underpaying by $47 -- lives in the heads of experienced billing coordinators who've been doing this for decades. That's the "tribal knowledge" Zatanna says it wants to institutionalize. The question is: whose tribal knowledge? And how did founders without visible roots in this world get access to it? The 30,000 historical EOBs they claim on LinkedIn would be a meaningful dataset, but at pre-seed with no visible customers, the provenance of that data is unexplained. It could be a genuinely strong signal -- a partnership, an acquisition, a founder connection we can't see publicly. Or it could be aspirational.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. The schlep in dental billing is enormous and real. Insurance verification, pre-authorizations, claims coding, EOB auditing, appeals -- each of these is a separate headache involving insurer-specific rules that change constantly. The existing PMS systems are record-keeping tools from the 2000s, not intelligent agents. And Zatanna's strategy of being a billing-layer augmentation rather than a full PMS replacement (which is Trust AI's harder path) could be the smarter wedge -- less threatening to existing workflows, easier to adopt. If these founders have a genuine data advantage in the EOB dataset, if they can build a system that demonstrably recovers missed revenue from underpaid claims, and if they can go practice-by-practice with the intensity of Collison-style installation, this is a real business. Jared Friedman backed them through YC, and his judgment carries weight. The vertical is right for AI agents: repetitive, rule-dense, error-prone, and economically consequential. If I could see evidence that these founders had spent months manually processing claims to understand the problem from the inside -- the DoorDash pattern of doing the work yourself before automating it -- my assessment would shift substantially.

But I don't see that evidence. What I see is technically capable young founders who identified a large, inefficient market and are applying AI to it. That's not nothing -- but it's the pattern I worry about most. Smart people sitting down to think of startup ideas, noticing that dental billing is broken, and building an AI solution. The market is real. The technology probably works at some level. But without an organic connection to the problem, without evidence that these founders understand the domain at the level of a veteran billing coordinator, and with multiple funded competitors already building in this space, I don't have enough signal to write a check. The earnestness test is hard to evaluate from a dossier, but the absence of any visible domain backstory -- combined with the presence of well-funded competitors who do have domain depth -- puts this in pass territory for me.

The team has technical credentials: CS degrees, internship experience at real companies, published ML research. That's enough to build software. But none of the founders' GitHub profiles show public repos, and the website wasn't even rendering content at the time of research. At pre-seed I don't expect much, but I do expect to see something built. The hacker signal -- a working demo, a scrappy prototype, code that demonstrates they've been up all night wrestling with insurer APIs -- isn't visible here.
