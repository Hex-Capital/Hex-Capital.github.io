# General Astronautics -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first question I ask about any startup is: how did the founders find this problem? With General Astronautics, the answer appears to be that two technically talented people from strong programs — Caltech/SpaceX and CMU Robotics — looked at the space industry and identified a logical gap: microgravity manufacturing needs robotic labor, and nobody's building versatile autonomous robots for it. That's a reasonable analysis. But analysis is different from discovery. Drew Houston didn't analyze the portable storage market — he kept forgetting his USB drive. The Collisons didn't study payment processing TAMs — they were programmers who hated integrating payments. Here, the problem statement reads like an industry briefing: "$130K per crew-hour on the ISS" is a statistic you find in market research, not a pain you feel in your bones. Nothing in the public record suggests either founder has personally tried to run a microgravity experiment and been blocked by the absence of robotic labor. The idea may be correct, but it has the fingerprints of construction rather than discovery.

The schlep, though — the schlep is real and massive. Space-qualifying hardware means thermal cycling, radiation hardening, vibration testing, vacuum qualification, and years of regulatory navigation before you can operate anything in orbit. That's the kind of tedious, frightening complexity that makes most founders unconsciously look elsewhere. GITAI has spent $60 million and years to get a single dual-arm demo outside the ISS. Redwire has public-company resources and decades of NASA relationships. The barrier to entry isn't just technical — it's temporal and financial in ways that most YC companies never face. In theory, this schlep should protect whoever gets through it. The problem is that schlep blindness works as a moat only when the founders have already started pushing through the schlep. Here, the company appears to be pre-prototype, pre-hardware, pre-everything. The schlep exists, but I don't see evidence they've begun the hard climb.

This brings me to what concerns me most: the multiple miracles problem. For General Astronautics to succeed, several independent things must converge. Commercial space stations (Axiom, Vast, Orbital Reef) must actually get built and become operational — none are yet. Microgravity manufacturing must prove economically viable at scale, which remains undemonstrated beyond a handful of pharmaceutical crystallization experiments. The founders must raise tens of millions in follow-on capital to bridge years of hardware development on a $500K YC check. And they must out-execute GITAI, which has flight heritage and a $60M head start. Any one of these failing kills the company. When I see a startup that needs a technological breakthrough AND a market to materialize AND massive follow-on capital AND to beat well-funded incumbents, the compounding probability becomes brutal.

Now, the bull case. I invested my largest personal check in Boom Supersonic — a hardware company building supersonic aircraft, which faces every objection I just raised about General Astronautics: capital intensity, long timelines, regulatory complexity, deep-pocketed aerospace incumbents. So I know I'm capable of overriding these priors when conviction is extreme. What would make General Astronautics that kind of bet? If Starship truly collapses launch costs by an order of magnitude, the economics of putting robotic payloads in orbit shift dramatically. If the ISS deorbits around 2030 and commercial stations come online, whoever has the standard robotic platform for those stations captures an entire ecosystem — the way Windows captured the PC ecosystem by being the standard layer everyone built on. The founding combination of SpaceX hardware experience plus CMU robotics autonomy is arguably the ideal pairing for this specific problem. If these two have the determination to survive a decade-long development cycle, the moat they'd build through flight heritage and microgravity manipulation data would be nearly insurmountable.

But I don't see the signals that would make me override my priors. Bram's SpaceX experience was a hardware reliability internship on Starlink lasers — valuable exposure, but not years of deep systems engineering on flight-critical hardware. Shibo's CMU robotics background comes solely from the YC page, with no confirmed LinkedIn, no public GitHub, no published research I can verify. For a company attempting one of the hardest engineering challenges in the startup world, I'd want to see founders with deeper flight hardware credentials, or at minimum, a working prototype that demonstrates they've already started solving the hardest problems. The website is a minimal landing page. There are no NASA SBIR awards, no LOIs from station operators, no partnerships announced. The NVIDIA Inception membership is essentially a program signup, not validation. At this stage, with this level of ambition, I need at least one concrete artifact — a prototype, a grant, a customer conversation with a named entity — to believe the founders are building rather than planning.

I keep coming back to the organic test. The strongest space companies I've seen had founders who were practically living inside the problem before they started the company. The General Astronautics team has adjacent experience — space hardware on one side, robotics on the other — but the specific intersection of microgravity manufacturing automation feels chosen rather than inevitable. Smart people noticing a gap is how consulting projects start. Startups that survive a decade of hardware development start because the founders can't stop thinking about the problem. I don't see that signal here.
