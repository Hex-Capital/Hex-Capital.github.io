# Skillsync -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Skillsync is that it lives in a space I genuinely care about -- making invisible people visible. I've backed Carta because cap tables were opaque, Affirm because credit card fees were hidden, Flock Safety because community safety data was locked away. And there's something real about the idea that brilliant engineers are contributing incredible work to open-source projects and nobody in recruiting can find them because they don't have a polished LinkedIn. That resonates with me on a gut level. The problem is, when I sit with this company longer, the resonance fades. This isn't making an invisible *system* visible to people who need transparency -- it's making an already-visible talent pool slightly more convenient for recruiters to search. The engineers Skillsync indexes aren't underserved. They're already employed, already writing code, already getting paid. This is a sourcing efficiency tool for recruiting teams, and while that's a fine business, it's not the kind of economic access story that gets me out of bed.

Here's what I'd want to ask these founders if we were sitting across from each other: tell me how you got here. Not the Juspay story, not the Hyperswitch star count -- I want to hear what made you the specific humans who need to solve this problem. And what I have in the dossier is a professional origin story: two engineers at the same company noticed that evaluating open-source contributors was hard, and they built a tool for it. That's legitimate domain proximity. Growing Hyperswitch from zero to 20K+ stars (now 40K+) means they genuinely lived inside the open-source contributor ecosystem. But I'm not hearing the biographical thread I look for -- the hardship that makes this problem personal rather than professional. Maybe it exists and the dossier just doesn't capture it. But from what I can see, this is "we noticed a problem at work" rather than "this problem shaped our lives." At the earliest stages, when I'm evaluating people and my conviction around whether that person can solve this particular problem, the difference between those two things matters enormously.

The idea itself doesn't trigger the weirdness signal I've trained myself to follow. Analyzing GitHub contributions for recruiting is... sensible. It's the kind of idea that makes investors nod rather than squirm. SeekOut has $189 million in funding and already indexes GitHub bios. HireEZ does open-web NLP sourcing. LinkedIn owns GitHub through Microsoft and has every incentive and capability to build this natively. When I look at my best investments -- SpaceX when private space was dismissed, Crusoe when turning flare gas into compute sounded delusional, Contraline when male birth control made VCs visibly uncomfortable -- the common pattern is that the *category* itself repelled other investors. Developer sourcing from GitHub doesn't repel anyone. It's a feature request, not a paradigm shift. And the Product Hunt launch with 3 upvotes, the positioning pivot from internal team analytics to external recruiting -- these suggest the founders are still searching for the version of this that truly clicks, which is normal at pre-seed but doesn't give me the conviction signal I need.

Let me steelman the bull case, because I want to be honest about what could make this work. If these founders nail the quality of code-to-skill extraction -- and their Rust expertise and open-source background suggest they might -- they could build a data asset that's genuinely hard to replicate. The structured skill profiles get better with scale, and the specialized engineering niches they're targeting (systems, robotics, edge ML) are exactly the segments where traditional recruiting is most broken. The $499/month per-seat pricing shows commercial sophistication. And the timing argument is real: LLMs just made deep code understanding feasible at a cost that wasn't possible two years ago. If I squint, I can see a version of this that becomes the definitive source of truth for engineering capability -- a "Carta for developer skills" that creates a new transparent layer where opacity existed. But for that to happen, they'd need to navigate the developer consent issue (creating profiles without opt-in will generate community backlash, and I know enough about security and privacy from my IronPort years to feel that tension acutely), avoid getting crushed by Microsoft/LinkedIn's distribution advantage, and find a way to make the data moat real before well-funded incumbents bolt on code analysis features. That's a lot of "ifs" for a company that hasn't yet demonstrated which of its use cases actually converts to revenue.

The co-founder dynamic is the one dimension where I feel some comfort. They worked together at Juspay, built in the same codebase, and bring complementary skills -- Narayana on product and GTM, Nishant deep in Rust and systems engineering. That's a real working relationship, not two strangers who met at a co-founder matching event. I've seen too many companies die from founder conflict (HQ Trivia still haunts me), and at least here the foundation looks solid. But I haven't seen evidence of how they handle a real crisis together, and that's ultimately what separates teams that endure from teams that fracture.

This is a pass for me. The founders are competent and the domain fit is genuine, but nothing here activates the conviction circuits I've learned to trust. It's not unpopular enough, the founders' connection to the problem isn't biographical enough, and the economic access story isn't there. I'd need to hear something in their personal narrative that changes my read -- some lived experience that makes this problem burn for them in a way that professional observation alone can't sustain through the years of grinding that building a company requires.
