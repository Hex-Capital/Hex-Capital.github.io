# Docura Health -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything about the absence of specific knowledge. Supio has $91M, Wisedocs is doing $14.4M in revenue with 116 employees, DigitalOwl got acquired by Datavant -- and the founder entering this arena is a recent UC Berkeley CS grad whose prior venture lasted eight months. The question isn't whether AI can automate medical record review. Everyone already knows it can. Five companies with real capital are proving it. The question is: what does Akhil Sachdev know about medico-legal evaluation that Supio's team with $91M can't learn? I see no evidence of an answer. His GitHub repos show OCR projects and a self-driving car decal -- technically adjacent, entirely replicable. No medical credentials. No legal industry experience. No indication he's spent years inside the workers' compensation system understanding its pathologies from the inside. This is a smart engineer who identified a workflow bottleneck by observation, not by inhabitation. Any competent ML engineer with six months of domain research arrives at the same product spec.

The physician-facing positioning is the claimed differentiation -- competitors serve lawyers and insurers, Docura serves the evaluating physician directly. That's a genuine gap in the market map. But positioning is not specific knowledge. Understanding why physicians evaluate the way they do, what the failure modes of AMA impairment ratings look like in practice, how state workers' comp boards actually adjudicate contested reports -- that knowledge comes from being embedded in the system, not from building a Chrome extension. The strongest version of this company would have a QME physician as co-founder alongside a technical builder. Instead, you have a solo technical founder in a domain where regulatory nuance and clinical credibility are the actual moats.

The leverage architecture is real but narrow. Compressing hours of manual record review into five minutes is genuine productivity leverage for individual physicians -- and the "doubled their case volume" claim, if accurate, demonstrates measurable output multiplication. But the user base is structurally small. QME and IME physicians in the U.S. workers' compensation system number in the low thousands. This isn't Replit making coding accessible to millions of non-programmers. It's a vertical SaaS tool for a niche professional workflow. The leverage ratio per user is high; the total addressable leverage is constrained. I look for companies where one engineer's work serves millions. Here, the ceiling is thousands of physicians processing more reports -- valuable to those physicians, but not the kind of nonlinear scaling that produces outlier returns.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If Docura locks in the physician-evaluator workflow before competitors expand from their current segments, it could own the supply side of medico-legal evaluation. Physicians are notoriously sticky with their tools. The AMA Guides impairment rating engine is genuinely specialized -- getting 5th and 6th Edition calculations right requires careful implementation that a generic document AI wouldn't nail. And the workers' comp market is $57B. If physician adoption compounds through referral networks within QME panels, Docura could become the de facto standard for medico-legal report generation, then expand into adjacent physician documentation workflows. The early user testimonials suggesting real usage -- 50,000+ pages monthly -- indicate someone is deriving genuine value. For this bull case to work, though, you'd need the solo founder to simultaneously maintain regulatory compliance across multiple states, sell to physicians who trust credentials, build and refine an ML pipeline, and outrun competitors with 50-100x more capital. That's not a leverage story. That's a grind story.

There's no contrarian timing here. "AI will automate document-heavy professional workflows" is the most consensus thesis in venture capital right now. Nobody smart is on the other side of that trade. The only potentially contrarian element -- that the physician side of the workflow has been overlooked while everyone builds for lawyers and insurers -- is more of a go-to-market observation than a deep structural insight about where the world is headed. When I invested in Uber at a $4M valuation, smart people genuinely believed ride-sharing was illegal and impossible. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, the consensus was that it was a toy for cypherpunks. Here, the consensus already agrees with the thesis. The pricing of ideas, like the pricing of assets, reflects available information. When everyone agrees AI will transform medical documentation, the returns accrue to whoever has the deepest specific knowledge and the strongest distribution -- not to whoever built the nth implementation.

The prior venture discontinuation after eight months isn't disqualifying by itself -- many great founders have false starts. But combined with the domain knowledge gap, the solo team, and the competitive intensity, it adds uncertainty about long-term compounding orientation. I want founders building for decades, not founders who might pivot when the going gets hard in a regulated domain they don't deeply understand. The technology itself -- LLM-based document processing with domain-specific templates -- does not compound in a distinctive way. Every major AI lab improvement makes the core capability more accessible to competitors. The specialized AMA rating engine creates some technical complexity, but it's implementation work, not fundamental research. Nothing here gets exponentially harder to replicate over time.
