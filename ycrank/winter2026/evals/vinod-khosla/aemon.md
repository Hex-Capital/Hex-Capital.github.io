# Aemon -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about Aemon isn't the founders or the technology -- it's the competitive dynamics. Google DeepMind published AlphaEvolve in May 2025, proved that LLM-powered evolutionary search can crack hard optimization problems, and within months the open-source community had replicated and surpassed the results. OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve -- multiple independent teams beat AlphaEvolve's benchmarks. The circle packing record that Aemon claims as its marquee proof point? A 36kr article attributes a comparable result to a different individual using a different framework. When your primary credibility signal is a benchmark that half a dozen teams have also cracked, the signal has degraded. This is a well-documented, reproducible paradigm. And Aemon's proposition is: we'll productize it. That's not the kind of bet I make.

Let me be clear about why. My first question is always: if this works -- fully, completely, at scale -- does it change how an industry operates? The meta-capability argument for Aemon is real and I don't dismiss it lightly. If you could automate algorithmic discovery itself -- not just solve one optimization problem but build the machine that solves all optimization problems -- the compounding effect across science and engineering is staggering. That's a vision worth pursuing. But Aemon isn't framing it that way. Their website says "Book a Discovery Call." Their demonstrated use cases are legal retrieval optimization and a math benchmark. They're positioning as a B2B tool that makes R&D teams more efficient at specific tasks. They've narrowed the ambition to something manageable. And manageable ambitions produce manageable outcomes. The consequence of success, as currently framed, is a solid software business selling optimization-as-a-service -- not the replacement of how R&D works.

The founders are genuinely impressive. Twin brothers, both publishing at ICLR and EMNLP before age 20, Richard with international mathematics and robotics medals, both dropping out to build this. That kind of precocious research ability is rare and real. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, he was a New Zealander with no aerospace pedigree attempting what everyone said was impossible. The key word there is *impossible* -- the consensus was that a private company from New Zealand couldn't build an orbital-class launch vehicle. Aemon's founders are talented, but they're not attempting something the consensus considers impossible. They're attempting to productize something Google already proved works. That's execution, not invention. The courage to attempt what experts dismiss -- that signal is absent here.

Here's the bull case I've genuinely considered: these two are 20 years old with research credentials most PhD students don't achieve. Their learning rate could be extraordinary -- the kind of athletes who, given any new problem, will outrun everyone else. The <$10 compute claim for a world-record result, if real, suggests algorithmic efficiency advantages that aren't obvious from the published literature. LLM inference costs are collapsing, which means evolutionary search that was economically absurd two years ago is now cheap and getting cheaper. And Google, despite having AlphaEvolve, has shown no interest in commercializing it externally -- Google research labs don't build products for other engineering teams, they optimize Borg schedulers and Gemini training kernels. There is a real window for a dedicated product company. If Ray and Richard evolve their thinking rapidly -- if three months from now they've abandoned assumptions, discovered something about the market that nobody else sees, and expanded their ambition from "optimization tool" to "the platform that replaces how computational R&D is conducted" -- then this becomes a very different conversation.

But I'm not investing in what might happen to their thinking. I'm evaluating what's in front of me. The core evolutionary search technique is open-source reproducible. The benchmarks are competitive leaderboards where records fall monthly. Google could commercialize at any moment if the market proves large enough. There's no evidence of revenue, customers, or even waitlist numbers. The team is homogeneous -- both founders share the same background, same age, same research profile -- with no visible plan to recruit the enterprise sales capability or domain expertise that converting "Discovery Calls" into revenue requires. And most fundamentally, the problem as currently scoped -- making optimization tasks faster for engineering teams -- doesn't keep me up at night the way eliminating animal agriculture or achieving nuclear fusion does. Some problems are too important not to work on. This problem, at Aemon's current level of ambition, doesn't clear that bar.
