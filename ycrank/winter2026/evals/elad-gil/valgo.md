# Valgo -- Elad Gil Evaluation

These founders wrote the textbook. Literally -- "Algorithms for Validation," MIT Press, co-authored by both Moss and Katz. They teach Stanford's course on the subject. They were core team members on ACAS X, the FAA-certified aircraft collision avoidance system that became an international standard. In twenty years of investing, I've rarely seen founder-market fit this precise. The question isn't whether they understand the problem -- they defined the field. The question is whether the market structure rewards a startup attacking it right now, and whether two PhDs can make the transition from lab to company.

Start with the structural moment. Safety validation for autonomous systems has been important for decades, but three things are converging that create urgency: autonomy is expanding beyond automotive into aviation (FAA Part 135 autonomous cargo, eVTOL certification), defense (DoD autonomy mandates), and robotics -- all regulated domains where formal safety validation is mandatory, not optional. Applied Intuition's $15B valuation validated simulation/validation as a standalone software category. And the cost of high-fidelity simulation at scale is becoming a bottleneck as autonomous systems grow more complex. But I'll be honest: this isn't a sharp inflection like the GPT-3 to GPT-4 jump that made Harvey's timing obvious. The "why now" here is a gradual convergence of adoption curves across multiple industries simultaneously. That's real, but it doesn't create the same urgency premium that a single capability threshold crossing would. The market also fits my "too boring" archetype perfectly -- safety validation tooling triggers the same dismissive reaction that PagerDuty's operations alerting triggered a decade ago. Most investors look at this and think "niche infrastructure for testing." I look at it and see a category that every company deploying autonomous systems in any regulated domain will eventually need.

The competitive dynamics are the sharpest risk here. Applied Intuition raised $1.2B, is valued at $15B, and is expanding from automotive into defense -- directly into Valgo's target domain. Their structural position is full-stack simulation, which creates a potential bundling threat: why would a customer buy a separate validation layer when Applied Intuition can add algorithmic validation features to their existing platform? But I've seen this pattern before. Ansys and Siemens sell comprehensive simulation suites, which creates channel conflict if they try to offer a lightweight, pluggable tool that works with competitors' simulators. Applied Intuition has the same structural constraint -- their business model depends on customers using their simulator, not wrapping around someone else's. Valgo's black-box, simulator-agnostic approach is architecturally incompatible with what a full-stack player would build. That's a real wedge. The deeper question is whether "pluggable algorithmic validation layer" is a large enough category to sustain an independent company, or whether it gets absorbed as a feature of the dominant simulation platform. I think the cross-industry angle -- aviation, defense, robotics, space -- makes the horizontal play viable in a way that staying automotive-only would not.

The single-miracle test produces a clean result here. Valgo doesn't need a scientific breakthrough -- the algorithms work, proven by ACAS X deployment at scale. Their one miracle is productizing academic research into enterprise tooling that safety engineering teams adopt and depend on. The science is done; the challenge is translation. That's a clean single miracle, and it's the kind of miracle that execution velocity determines. But the multi-domain ambition concerns me with a two-person team. Seven target industries -- aviation, automotive, robotics, space, defense, energy, finance -- is a red flag for focus at this stage. Which industry is the beachhead? Defense and aviation are where the regulatory moat is deepest and where the founders' credentials (MIT Lincoln Lab, NASA, JHU APL) carry the most weight. If they focus there, the regulatory complexity becomes a structural barrier that most software investors avoid and most software competitors can't easily breach. That's a moat pattern I'm uniquely comfortable with from my Color Health experience.

The execution risk is real and I won't minimize it. Both founders are fresh PhDs with no prior startup experience. Moss finished his doctorate in 2025, Katz in 2023. There's no visible product -- no screenshots, no public repos, no revenue, no customer announcements. The GitHub organization has zero public repositories and four followers. At pre-seed this is normal, but it means I have zero execution velocity data. The ACAS X work demonstrates they can build systems that get deployed at scale in safety-critical domains -- but in a government research lab context with MIT Lincoln Laboratory resources, not a startup context with $500K and a deadline. The transition from academic researcher to startup operator is its own miracle, and I'd want to see evidence of product shipping velocity before I could move to high conviction. Moss's GitHub profile (104 repos, 1.4k stars on BeautifulAlgorithms.jl) shows a prolific builder, but research code and production enterprise tooling are different animals.

The strongest bull case: if Valgo becomes the horizontal safety validation layer across regulated industries, the TAM is dramatically larger than the $1B automotive simulation market suggests. Every autonomous drone, every surgical robot, every self-flying aircraft, every autonomous vehicle needs to demonstrate safety to regulators. The founders' academic authority creates a distribution channel through Stanford's research-to-production pipeline -- companies hiring from these programs already know the algorithms and the tools. The regulatory moat in defense and aviation is deep and structural. And the product-to-distribution trajectory exists: start with algorithmic validation, expand into compliance documentation, certification support, continuous monitoring, risk assessment. The customer relationship with enterprise safety teams -- once established -- is extremely sticky. This could be the Stripe of safety validation: a horizontal layer that starts narrow and distributes additional products through the same integration. That's the scenario where this becomes a defining company. I'm not there yet because I need to see product and early adoption signals, but the structural ingredients are present in a way that keeps me interested.
