# Librar Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The tagline tells me everything: "the intelligence layer for the physical world." That's a platform vision. What they've actually built is a library management system for schools. I've seen this pattern hundreds of times — a team with real execution ability wrapping a vertical SaaS product in language that implies civilizational ambition. The gap between the tagline and the product is the gap between consequence and capability. Let me be direct: if Librar Labs succeeds beyond anyone's wildest expectations and captures the entire global library management software market, the result is a business worth somewhere between $670 million and $3.5 billion in a market growing at single-digit percentages. Nobody's world changes. No incumbent industry collapses. No trillion-dollar system gets replaced. The founders have found a real problem — most schools lack library systems — and built a working solution. In doing so, they've reduced their probability of failure while ensuring the consequence of their success is, by my standards, inconsequential.

I'll give the team credit for genuine execution velocity. Three hundred schools in three months, 60% penetration of Swedish single-site private schools — that's not nothing at pre-seed. It suggests a product that works, a distribution motion that clicks, and founders who can close. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson scaled Ungdomsförmedlingen to 40,000 members, which demonstrates an ability to build and grow a user base from scratch. These are young founders — Görtz appears to be around 20 or 21 — and that youth gives them energy. But energy without a sufficiently large target is just motion. The prior ventures listed (Cyberboost, Gymbro AI, a social media agency) were each under a year, none with exits. I don't see contrarian courage here. Nobody told these founders that library management software was impossible. Nobody laughed at the idea. It's a sensible, defensible niche — and that's the problem. When Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routers would never work in public telecom networks, that was a signal. When incumbents shrug because the market is too small for them to worry about, that's a different signal entirely.

The computer vision component — photographing shelves to identify and catalog books — is clever engineering. It genuinely differentiates against Follett Destiny's barcode-scanning workflow and Koha's manual data entry. But I have to ask: does this technology make Follett's approach economically unviable? No. Follett has 75,000 school installations and $378 million in parent revenue. They could add a camera feature to their existing product if they wanted to. AWS Rekognition or Google Vision could be integrated into any competing library system. The CV capability here is a feature advantage, not a structural disruption. It makes setup 99% faster — but setup is a one-time event. Once the library is cataloged, the ongoing value is a standard ILS with checkout, reminders, and dashboards. That's a commodity.

Now, the strongest bull case: what if the library vertical is genuinely a wedge into something much larger? Computer vision that identifies and catalogs physical objects from photographs is a horizontal capability. Start with book spines, expand to retail inventory, museum collections, warehouse management, medical supply tracking. The "intelligence layer for the physical world" tagline could be prophetic rather than aspirational. If these founders build proprietary training data across hundreds of thousands of physical environments and develop CV models that generalize beyond libraries, the consequence magnitude shifts dramatically. Additionally, the literacy argument deserves engagement — low adult literacy genuinely costs the U.S. economy $2.2 trillion annually, and if better library infrastructure meaningfully improves childhood reading outcomes, the social consequence is significant. But the causal chain from "school has library management software" to "students become literate" has too many missing links to constitute an investment thesis. And the platform expansion is entirely hypothetical — no second product, no announced roadmap, no evidence of horizontal ambition beyond a tagline.

The timing is reasonable — computer vision crossed a commercial viability threshold in the last two years, smartphone cameras are now sufficient for this task without specialized hardware, and there's post-pandemic attention on school infrastructure gaps. But this isn't an exponential curve that demands I invest before the window closes. Library management software isn't AI in 2019, where the trajectory was clearly exponential and the talent flow was accelerating. The underlying technology (CV for object recognition) is already mature and widely available. The founders are well-positioned to build a solid SaaS business, but that's not what I invest for. I invest for outcomes where the world operates differently if the company succeeds. This company, at full success, makes librarians more efficient. That is a worthwhile product and a worthwhile business — but it is not a problem too important not to work on, and it is not a bet calibrated to the magnitude of the world's real problems.
