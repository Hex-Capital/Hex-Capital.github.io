# Chasi -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Chasi is that it's an AI agent for vertical sales automation -- which in February 2026 is approximately the most consensus category in technology. Every YC batch has a dozen companies applying LLM-powered agents to some industry's sales workflow. The specific choice of equipment dealers is less crowded than, say, healthcare or legal, but the playbook is identical: take a fragmented, phone-dependent industry with legacy software, drop in conversational AI, automate follow-ups and data entry. That's not a secret. That's a PowerPoint slide half of YC has already built. When I look for asymmetric upside, I need the crowd to be wrong about something. Here, the crowd is building the exact same thing across fifty verticals simultaneously.

The founders' specific knowledge is the strongest signal, but it's not as deep as I want it to be. Both Akash and Sarman were on the founding team at Axion Ray -- a legitimate AI-for-manufacturing company that grew to $62M in funding and deployed at Boeing, Cummins, Denso, Harley Davidson. That's real. They understand the slow sales cycles, the integration complexity, and the institutional skepticism that comes with selling AI to traditional industrial companies. Akash's mechanical engineering background and tractor manufacturing experience at TAFE adds texture. Sarman's CS from Waterloo and founding engineer tenure at Tesla provides genuine technical depth. But the knowledge they carry is "how to sell AI to industrial companies" -- not "what equipment dealers specifically need to close more revenue." The gap between quality detection for aerospace manufacturers and sales automation for equipment rental companies is wider than their shared industrial veneer suggests. A smart team from any industrial AI startup could have identified sub-60% fleet utilization and phone-dependent workflows. The insight isn't wrong -- it's just not uniquely theirs.

The leverage architecture is functional but undifferentiated. AI agents handling sales and service requests 24/7 is genuine software leverage -- one piece of code replaces repetitive labor across an entire dealer operation. The reported metrics (2+ hours saved per day per rep, 3x faster response rates, 15% increase in quote-to-win) are real value if accurate. But this is the same leverage that every AI agent company creates. There are no network effects here. This isn't a platform others build on. It's a tool that plugs into existing dealer management systems. My portfolio leans heavily toward infrastructure and picks-and-shovels -- Alchemy, not a DeFi app; Replit, not a software product built on Replit. Chasi sits at the application layer, dependent on the DMS providers who could restrict API access or build the same functionality themselves. That's a structurally vulnerable position.

The bull case worth engaging with: equipment distribution is genuinely enormous ($78B+ in US rental alone), genuinely underserved by modern software, and these founders have uncommon credibility in the room. The AED Ambassador partnership and booth at the AED Summit 2026 suggest they're building relationships through industry channels, not cold outreach -- which matters enormously when selling to relationship-driven industrial buyers. If Chasi can get embedded in enough dealer workflows before horizontal AI platforms or Moab's $16M ERP push absorbs this function, the switching costs from handling live customer interactions could create a real wedge. There's a scenario where this becomes the default revenue intelligence layer for equipment dealers, accumulating proprietary data on demand patterns, pricing, and conversion that makes the AI measurably better over time. That data flywheel is the path to compounding defensibility. But it's a path, not a reality -- nothing in the dossier confirms it's active.

Moab's simultaneous entry with $16M, Elad Gil's backing, an ex-Uber PM, and an ex-Ramp Head of Engineering is the competitive fact I can't ignore. They're building the comprehensive operating system for equipment dealers. Chasi is building the AI sales overlay. Today those are different products, but Moab adding AI communication features to a modern ERP is a natural extension -- while Chasi expanding from sales agents into full ERP replacement is a much harder climb. When a well-funded competitor can absorb your product as a feature, your position is precarious regardless of how good your current execution is. The structural question isn't whether Chasi's AI agents work -- it's whether "AI sales agent for equipment dealers" is a company or a feature. I don't have enough conviction that it's the former.

The technology itself -- LLM-powered conversational agents with vertical domain tuning -- is commoditizing at an accelerating rate. The barrier here is integration knowledge and equipment-specific workflow understanding, not fundamental technical novelty. A competent team with six months of domain immersion could build a comparable product. That's not the kind of compounding technology I look for -- where each iteration makes the system measurably harder to replicate. Compare this to Stack Overflow's knowledge graph, where every question and answer made the platform exponentially more valuable, or Alchemy's blockchain API layer, where infrastructure lock-in deepened with every developer building on it. Chasi's moat, if it develops, will come from data accumulation and switching costs -- both of which require sustained deployment that hasn't been demonstrated yet.

These are capable founders attacking a real market with a working product. But capable founders in a real market building what everyone else is building is a recipe for a competitive slog, not a 1000x outcome. I optimize for bets where nine go to zero and the tenth goes to the moon. This looks more like a company that could build a solid $20-50M ARR business -- which is great for the founders but doesn't move the needle for my portfolio construction. I'd want to see either deeper specific knowledge about equipment dealer economics that changes my view of the moat, or a platform architecture that makes Chasi the infrastructure layer rather than the application layer.
