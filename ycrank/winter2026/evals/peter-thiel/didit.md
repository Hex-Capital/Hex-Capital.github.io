# Didit -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The identity verification market is a Girardian nightmare. Persona has raised $418 million at a $2 billion valuation. Sumsub generates $85.6 million in annual revenue. Veriff sits at a $1.5 billion valuation. Onfido was acquired by Entrust for $650 million. And now Didit enters this arena with $2 million and twelve people, proposing to win by being cheaper. I ask every founder the same question: *What important truth do very few people agree with you on?* The implicit answer here -- that identity verification should be free at the core tier and that AI cost deflation makes this economically viable -- is not a secret. It is a consensus observation that every participant in this market can see, and that any well-funded competitor can replicate by writing a slightly larger check to subsidize their own free tier. When your differentiation is a pricing spreadsheet rather than a proprietary technology, you have not escaped competition. You have entered it at a structural disadvantage.

The pivot history deepens my concern. These founders began with Gamium -- a blockchain metaverse venture launched in 2021 that issued the GMM token in March 2022 and partnered with Meta and Telefónica. The current B2B SaaS KYC product, with V1 shipping in August 2024, is a fundamentally different company built on a fundamentally different thesis. I have written extensively about why lean methodology is code for the absence of a plan. A founder who pivots from crypto metaverse to enterprise KYC in 24 months is not demonstrating the definite optimism I look for -- they are demonstrating the iterative search process I explicitly avoid. Zuckerberg refused Yahoo's billion-dollar offer because he had a specific vision for what Facebook would become. Musk persisted through three rocket failures because he had a concrete plan for reusable launch. What is the definite vision here? The founders appear to be talented engineers who keep trying things until something generates revenue. That is competence. It is not conviction.

The dossier states plainly what I would have concluded independently: "The primary differentiation is pricing and integration speed rather than proprietary technology." And: "The core technology stack (OCR, biometric matching, liveness detection) is available from multiple providers and underlying model capabilities are improving rapidly." This is a 1-to-n business by my exact definition -- taking existing capabilities and offering them at a lower price point. The technology bar for identity verification is falling, not rising. When AI inference costs drop another order of magnitude, every SaaS company with basic engineering talent will be able to offer KYC at Didit's price points. A race to zero in a commodity market is the opposite of monopoly.

I will acknowledge the bull case, because the traction metrics are legitimately impressive within the constraints of this stage. Seven hundred active B2B customers growing at 20% month-over-month. Three hundred percent net revenue retention at month six. Near-profitability on only $2 million in capital. These numbers suggest genuine product-market fit and extraordinary capital efficiency. If there were a structural path to monopoly here, these metrics would be electrifying. The theoretical path would be reusable KYC -- if users verify once through Didit and carry that credential across platforms, a network effect emerges where every additional business accepting Didit credentials increases the value for verified users and vice versa. That would be a genuine zero-to-one insight: transforming identity verification from a per-transaction commodity into a persistent identity network. But this is aspirational architecture, not demonstrated reality. The reusable KYC feature requires simultaneous consumer adoption (a digital identity wallet) and business adoption (accepting third-party credentials), which is a two-sided marketplace cold-start problem layered on top of an already competitive B2B sales challenge. And the concept of portable digital identity is not contrarian -- it is the stated objective of EU eIDAS 2.0, a dozen blockchain identity projects, and most of the incumbents Didit competes with. A secret that everyone is already working on is not a secret.

The go-to-market confirms the competitive rather than monopoly orientation. Didit targets fintech, crypto, telecom, and e-commerce simultaneously across 220 countries and 48 languages. Named customers span Crnogorski Telekom, GBTC Finance, Shiply, and TucanPay -- a scattered portfolio across industries and geographies with no discernible beachhead. Stripe began with developers. Facebook began with Harvard. PayPal began with eBay power sellers. Monopolies start narrow and expand concentrically. Didit is pursuing breadth from inception, which is the market strategy of a company that expects to compete for share, not one that expects to dominate a niche and expand from a position of strength.

I pass. The founders are technically capable, the traction is real, and the company may build a viable business. But a viable business in a competitive market with commodity technology is not what generates power-law returns. There is no secret here that the consensus rejects. There is no technology that makes the existing approach obsolete. There is no structural path to a position that will be unassailable in ten years. This is a company built to compete, and competition -- in identity verification as in food delivery -- is a game where everyone loses slowly.
