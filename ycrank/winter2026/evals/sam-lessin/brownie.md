# IncidentFox -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is the single most consensus idea I've seen in a while. "AI SRE agent that triages and fixes production incidents" -- I could name five funded competitors from memory, the largest of which has raised $160 million and is valued at a billion dollars. Datadog is shipping Bits AI. PagerDuty has SRE Agents. Microsoft is building this into Azure. When a blog post in February 2026 is literally titled "Lots of AI SRE, no AI incident management," the category has already been named, mapped, and colonized. This isn't a contrarian bet -- it's a consensus land rush, and the land is already claimed. My entire framework starts with the question: is this a credible person pursuing an idea that most investors think is crazy? Jimmy Wei and Long Yi are credible -- Cornell MS, Meta FAIR research, Roblox infrastructure at 100M+ DAU. They've operated at scale. But the idea provokes zero skepticism from anyone. Every VC in San Francisco would nod and say "yes, AI SRE is a massive category." That's exactly the signal that tells me the returns are already priced in.

The deeper structural problem is that IncidentFox fails what I'd call the subtraction test. Take away the AI and what do you have? Nothing. There is no business without the LLM. This is the opposite of my "cherry on top" framework -- AI isn't enhancing an already-good business, AI IS the entire business. And when AI is the product rather than the accelerant, you're in a race where every improvement in base model capabilities helps your competitors exactly as much as it helps you. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The core LLM-based investigation capabilities use publicly available models and techniques." When your differentiation is execution and UX on top of commoditized AI, you're one Datadog feature launch away from irrelevance. I'd rather invest in a company that manages physical server rooms with a thin software layer than a software company that manages servers through an API -- the former gets stronger as AI arrives, the latter gets absorbed.

The open-source angle deserves a real look because it's the most interesting structural choice the team has made. The bull case goes something like this: Grafana carved out a massive business by being the vendor-agnostic observability layer while Datadog tried to lock everyone into its proprietary stack. IncidentFox could be the "Switzerland" of incident investigation -- the open-source standard that works across every observability vendor, creating value precisely because incumbents are structurally incentivized not to be vendor-agnostic. If the 305 GitHub stars became 30,000, if the open-source community started contributing integrations faster than any proprietary team could, you'd have something approaching a protocol position. The vendor-agnostic integration layer could theoretically become infrastructure that others build on. For this bull case to work, though, you'd need the community flywheel to actually spin -- and 305 stars with 4 contributors after multiple Show HN posts that got 3 and 1 points respectively is not the flywheel spinning. Grafana had years of community momentum and a fundamentally different developer adoption curve. More importantly, Apache 2.0 licensing means anyone can fork and commercialize -- including a well-funded competitor who could take IncidentFox's open-source codebase, add enterprise features, and outspend them on go-to-market.

The "per-customer learning" argument -- where IncidentFox analyzes your codebase, Slack history, and past incidents to build organizational context -- sounds like a data moat. But it's not a network effect. Customer A's incident patterns don't make the product better for Customer B. It's a switching cost at best, and a weak one, because every competitor in this space can offer the same "we learn your infrastructure" onboarding. Resolve AI, with $160 million in funding, can build a more sophisticated version of the same per-customer adaptation with significantly more engineering resources. The 300+ pre-built integrations represent real engineering effort, but engineering effort without structural lock-in is just a head start that erodes. The YC URL slug "brownie" suggesting a prior pivot adds a soft signal that concerns me -- it hints that the founders may have arrived at this problem through market scanning rather than deep, thesis-driven conviction.

The potential pivot, combined with the timing of entry into an already-hot category, reminds me of a pattern I've seen repeatedly: talented engineers gravitating toward the obvious application of new technology rather than the non-obvious one. The non-obvious AI SRE play would be something structural -- a new primitive for infrastructure observability that makes existing tools better rather than competing with them. Instead, IncidentFox is building an application layer on top of someone else's infrastructure (Slack, Datadog, Grafana, LLMs), which caps the ceiling even in the best case. There's no path to becoming a standard that others build on, no protocol-layer position, no compounding network dynamics. The narrative can stretch to "autonomous infrastructure management" but that's the exact same narrative Resolve AI, NeuBird, and every incumbent is telling. When your infinity story is shared with five well-funded competitors and multiple public companies, it's not your story anymore.

I'm passing. The founders have real credentials and genuine domain experience, and in a world where this category wasn't already crowded with competitors who have 100x their funding, I'd give it more serious consideration. But the structural logic doesn't work for me -- this is a software company where the software is the entire business, in a consensus market where incumbents have massive distribution advantages, built on commoditized AI capabilities with an open-source license that eliminates even the proprietary code as a barrier. The combination of "AI is the product" plus "everyone else is building the same thing" plus "no structural moat beyond execution" is exactly the pattern I've been publicly arguing is the worst place to deploy capital in 2026.
