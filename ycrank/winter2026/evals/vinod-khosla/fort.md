# Fort -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most telling detail in Fort's story isn't what they're building — it's what they walked away from. The team explored EMG sensors early on, electromyography that directly measures muscle electrical activation, and then pivoted to heart rate and motion sensors for "consumer viability." That decision crystallizes everything I need to know. EMG at consumer price points would have been a genuinely new measurement category — the kind of technology that could eventually transform physical therapy, rehabilitation, sports science, and occupational health. It would have been hard. It might have failed. But the consequence of success would have been substantial. Instead, they chose commodity IMU and PPG sensors — the same components inside every WHOOP band and Apple Watch on the planet — and decided to win on algorithms. They reduced the probability of failure and, in doing so, reduced the consequence of success to building a slightly better fitness tracker.

Let me be direct about what happens if Fort fully succeeds. They become the dominant strength training wearable. They sell millions of $349 bands with recurring subscriptions. They build a profitable consumer electronics company worth perhaps one to three billion dollars. And the world is... marginally different. Gym-goers get better data about their proximity to failure on a bench press. That's a product, not a transformation. Compare this to the systems I fund people to displace: animal agriculture occupying half the planet's arable land, fossil fuel power generation, monopoly-priced telecommunications infrastructure. Fort's target is a sub-segment of the fitness tracker market — itself a feature, not a fundamental human system. When I look at the consequence magnitude, the honest answer is that success here creates a nice business in a competitive consumer electronics market. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No industry becomes structurally obsolete.

The competitive dynamics make the consequence problem worse, not better. WHOOP already has $260M in revenue, the exact same sensor stack (wrist-worn IMU plus optical heart rate), and their own data shows strength workouts growing 122% year-over-year on their platform. That last fact is supposed to validate Fort's thesis, but it actually validates WHOOP's ability to capture the strength market through a software update. Oura sits at an $11 billion valuation. Apple has infinite R&D budget. The dossier itself acknowledges the commoditization risk: "A well-funded competitor could develop similar algorithms with sufficient training data." Fort's differentiation is algorithmic accuracy on commodity hardware — that's a feature advantage, not a structural moat. When Juniper challenged Cisco, they built fundamentally different architecture that Cisco couldn't replicate with a firmware patch. Fort's advantage could be replicated by WHOOP's data science team in a quarter.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. The strength training cultural moment is real and accelerating — GLP-1 adoption driving interest in muscle preservation, the longevity movement mainstreaming resistance training, the shift from "cardio culture" to "strength culture" among demographics that historically avoided the weight room. If Fort ships a product that genuinely auto-detects 50+ exercises with high accuracy and provides proximity-to-failure metrics that serious lifters can't get elsewhere, they could build a passionate initial user base. The multi-mount form factor — wrist, magnetic equipment attachment, body strap — is genuinely novel and could capture biomechanical data no wrist-only device matches. The Tesla hardware pedigree is meaningful for actually shipping a physical product at scale, which kills most hardware startups. And the proprietary training dataset could compound into a defensible algorithmic advantage over time. If everything breaks right, Fort could be the WHOOP of strength training — a focused, premium brand that outperforms generalist competitors in its niche. That's a legitimate venture outcome. It's just not the kind of outcome that justifies my involvement.

Three Tesla engineers building a consumer wearable is a team well-matched to the execution challenge but poorly calibrated to the ambition I look for. Miranda, Paul, and Zac are all mechanical engineers from the same employer working within their domain of expertise. There's no outsider dynamic — no biochemist wandering into food science, no Xerox PARC researcher reimagining networking. They're hardware people building hardware, which is competent but not the "irreverence and foolish confidence" that generates category-defining companies. The team is also notably homogeneous: three mechanical engineers, no ML specialist for the exercise auto-detection algorithms that constitute their core differentiator, no consumer brand builder for a direct-to-consumer play that will live or die on community and marketing. The gene pool isn't engineered against the venture's actual risks.

These founders are clearly talented, and they'll probably ship a working product. But I invest for the possibility that the world operates differently after the company succeeds. Fort's best outcome is a successful consumer electronics company in a crowded market where Apple, WHOOP, and Oura all have more capital, more data, and more users. The problem Fort solves — "my wearable doesn't track my deadlifts well enough" — is real but not important enough to work on at the scale of capital and talent being deployed here. I'd tell this team: you built sensing systems for autonomous vehicles and spacecraft. Go find a problem worthy of that capability.
