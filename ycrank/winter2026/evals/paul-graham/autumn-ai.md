# Autumn AI -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Autumn AI is that the problem they're solving is the opposite of invisible. Schlep blindness is what happens when a problem is so painful and tedious that smart people unconsciously filter it out -- nobody sees it, so nobody builds for it. That's how Stripe worked. Thousands of programmers knew payments were broken, but the regulatory and banking complexity was so ugly that their unconscious minds wouldn't let them consider tackling it. Monitoring buying signals for sales teams is not that kind of problem. It's one of the most visible, most funded categories in B2B SaaS right now. Clay has raised $204 million. 6sense has raised $526 million. Common Room, $105 million. Unify, $59 million. When five well-capitalized companies are already working on your problem, you're not exploiting schlep blindness. You're walking into a knife fight.

There is a genuine thread of organic discovery here, and I don't want to dismiss it. Vishnu built sourcing technology at Sierra Ventures -- a VC firm -- which means he was literally building tools to detect signals about companies worth investing in. That's adjacent to what Autumn AI does for sales teams. He didn't pick "sales intelligence" off a trend report; he encountered the problem through his own work. That matters. But adjacent isn't identical. VC deal sourcing and SDR prospecting share mechanics but differ in workflow, buyer psychology, and what counts as a meaningful signal. And critically, the dossier itself notes that the core capability -- monitoring public web sources and filtering by intent -- has a "low barrier to entry." That's the opposite of what I look for. When the barrier is low, you need either extraordinary execution speed or some structural advantage that compounds. I don't see either here yet.

The bull case deserves a full hearing. LLMs genuinely changed the economics of parsing unstructured web data in 2023-2024, and that creates a real "why now." Enterprise incumbents like 6sense charge $50,000 to $150,000 per year for cooperative third-party intent data, leaving a gap for mid-market teams who want real-time public signal monitoring at an accessible price point. If Autumn AI can nail that positioning -- the Stripe of buying signals, simple enough that any SDR can set it up in five minutes -- there's a version of this that works. The founders are technically strong. Shiv presented at NeurIPS, did an AI residency at SandboxAQ, and has 21 public GitHub repos. They met on their first day at Columbia and are best friends, which is the co-founder relationship pattern I trust most. And they've shipped -- there's a live web app at platform.autumnai.com. These are not founders who talk about building. They build.

But that bull case requires them to outrun Clay, which is already accessible to SMB teams, already growing fast, and already has $204 million to spend on exactly this problem. Unify is specifically doing signal-based warm outbound and growing 17% month-over-month. The "come in at the bottom of the market" playbook only works when the bottom is unoccupied. Here, it's crowded. The dossier finds zero public user counts, zero revenue figures, zero customer logos, zero testimonials, and zero press coverage. When you have a live product and still no visible evidence that anyone is pulling it toward them, that's a signal too. The absence of traction data is expected at pre-seed -- but the absence combined with a live product and a "Book a Call" CTA that goes to Calendly suggests they've been trying to sell and haven't yet found the pull.

On the technical founder dimension, this is where Autumn AI scores best. Both Vishnu and Shiv are genuine builders -- ML engineering at Modulus, AI research at SandboxAQ, a working product already deployed. Shiv founded an IoT device company at sixteen. These are hackers who make things, which is exactly the type I back. If they were attacking a problem with more structural defensibility -- something that required navigating regulatory complexity, or building infrastructure that gets harder to replicate as you scale -- their technical ability would be a much stronger signal. The constraint isn't their capability. It's the terrain they've chosen to fight on.

Both founders appear to still be undergraduates at Columbia, which introduces an execution bandwidth question I can't ignore when the competition has teams of hundreds. This is solvable -- plenty of great companies were started by students who dropped out or graduated into the work -- but it compounds the competitive pressure rather than relieving it. The tagline "Stalk your prospects at scale" is memorable, but the company needs to demonstrate that its particular approach to signal detection creates enough differentiation that customers choose it over platforms that bundle signal detection with enrichment, sequencing, and outreach. Right now, I don't see evidence that they've found that wedge.
