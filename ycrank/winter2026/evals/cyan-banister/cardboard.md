# Cardboard -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I noticed first about Cardboard: this is one of the most consensus categories in tech right now. AI video editing. Every fund I talk to is looking at some version of this. Runway has raised $860 million. Descript has OpenAI leading their Series C. OpusClip just raised at a $215 million valuation. When I say the most promising companies are not popular and are difficult to assess, I mean it -- and Cardboard is the exact inverse. It's easy to assess: AI makes video editing faster, marketing teams need video, here's a browser-based tool that does it. There's nothing about this that makes other investors uncomfortable. There's no moment where someone says "that's crazy" and walks away. And in my experience, when nobody thinks it's crazy, the opportunity has already been priced in or the space is about to get brutally competitive. I look for pockets of dreamers working on things the world hasn't recognized yet. AI video editing is something the world has very much recognized.

When I think about the founders, I see two technically capable engineers from BITS Pilani -- Saksham with his startup experience at Iterate AI and growth work at Flint, Ishan with 4.5 years of serious browser engineering at HackerRank and a genuinely impressive early signal in building Hotspoter at age 12 with 5.7 million downloads. That last detail catches my eye because I always notice the kids who build things before anyone tells them to. But when I ask my fundamental question -- tell me your story, not the business, how did you get here, why does THIS problem burn inside you -- I don't find the answer I need. Ishan made some internal launch videos at HackerRank. Saksham creates content on LinkedIn and Instagram. These are threads, but they're thin. I'm looking for the founder whose biography IS the company, where you can't separate the person from the problem. I backed Contraline because that founder spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone cared. I don't see that depth of personal stake here. I see smart people who identified a market gap.

The one dimension where Cardboard genuinely earns my respect is the co-founder relationship. Fifteen years. They met in school. After HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect timing and a perfect product can't survive founder conflict, I probe this harder than anything else. A decade and a half of friendship creates the kind of conflict-resolution muscle that you can't fake or build in a co-working space. Saksham brings the growth and AI instincts, Ishan brings the deep browser engineering chops -- the complementarity is real, and the duration of the relationship tells me they've already navigated disagreements and come out the other side. If I were going to invest in this space at all, this bond would be the reason.

The bull case deserves honest engagement: the compound technical bet of building both a browser-native NLE on WebGPU/WebCodecs and an agentic AI layer simultaneously is a real engineering challenge. Incumbents like Adobe genuinely cannot rebuild their rendering stacks without breaking existing workflows -- that's a classic innovator's dilemma. If Cardboard nails the agentic orchestration so that a marketing team can upload footage, type a goal, and get a broadcast-ready cut in minutes, that's a step-function improvement over everything else on the market. PostHog as an early customer is a credible signal. And the $60-$150/month pricing tiers suggest they're thinking about real revenue from the start. If you believe execution speed in a rapidly evolving AI stack matters more than capital -- that a two-person team using the latest multimodal models can outrun Runway's $860 million -- then Cardboard could be the right bet. The timing window where browser capabilities and LLM reasoning converge is real.

But for me, this doesn't activate what I invest on. It doesn't create economic access for people who lack it -- it makes video production faster for marketing teams that already have budgets. It doesn't make an invisible system visible or transparent in the way Carta did for cap tables or Affirm did for credit. It doesn't operate in a stigmatized or regulated space where complexity creates a moat -- there's no FDA pathway, no defense procurement maze, no category that makes polite investors squeamish. The defensibility concern is real: the underlying AI capabilities come from third-party APIs, other startups with browser engineering talent could replicate the approach, and the differentiation ultimately rests on execution speed in a race against very well-capitalized competitors. I wish them well -- they're clearly talented builders with a strong partnership. But this is a consensus bet in a hot market, and I've learned that my best investments are the ones that look wrong to everyone else at the time I write the check.
