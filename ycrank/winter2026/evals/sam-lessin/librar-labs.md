# Librar Labs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my fundamental problem with Librar Labs: the entire value proposition collapses without computer vision. Strip out the AI, and you're left with another library management SaaS competing against Follett Destiny's 75,000 installed school libraries and a free open-source alternative in Koha. The computer vision shelf-scanning isn't cherry on top of a great business -- it IS the business. That's exactly the structural position I've been warning about since my "SaaS era is over" argument. When general-purpose vision APIs from Google, Amazon, or the next foundation model improve -- which they will, relentlessly -- the core differentiator evaporates. Follett doesn't need to rebuild their entire product; they need to add one feature. Book spine recognition from a smartphone photo is a capability, not a company.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't activate my pattern recognition in the right way. Jonathan Görtz appears to be around 20 years old, with prior ventures (Cyberboost, Gymbro AI) that each lasted under a year with no identified exits. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson built Ungdomsförmedlingen to 40,000 members, which demonstrates real execution ability -- but in a different domain entirely. Having a founder who worked as a librarian provides genuine domain empathy, and I respect that. But the combination is a young, unproven team pursuing an idea that isn't insane at all -- "use AI to make library cataloging easier" is about as consensus as it gets in the current YC zeitgeist. My framework requires the idea to provoke genuine skepticism from most investors. Nobody hears "AI-powered library management" and thinks "that's crazy." They think "that's obvious." And obvious ideas with unproven teams don't produce outlier returns because the competitive response is predictable.

The bull case deserves honest engagement: 300 schools in three months, with 60% penetration of Swedish single-site private schools, is genuinely impressive adoption velocity. If the "98% of world's schools lack a library system" claim is directionally correct, this is a massive greenfield market where the existing incumbents have left enormous whitespace. Schools that could never afford Follett or couldn't staff a librarian could leapfrog straight to a smartphone-based system. There's a version of this story where Librar becomes the default library infrastructure for the developing world's schools, and "intelligence layer for the physical world" becomes more than a tagline -- maybe they scan classrooms, storage rooms, retail shelves, warehouses. If the team executes on that expansion, the narrative magnitude changes dramatically. But that requires me to believe that book spine recognition is a wedge into a much larger physical-world scanning platform, and I see no evidence the team has the technical depth to build that broader vision. The "AI researchers" claim on the about page has no supporting evidence in public sources.

What I keep coming back to is the Birchbox lesson applied differently. Birchbox had narrative magnitude without structural moat -- the subscription model was trivially replicable. Librar has the inverse problem: reasonable structural positioning in an underserved market, but the moat is built entirely on a software capability that gets cheaper and more commoditized every quarter. The switching costs once a school's catalog lives in the platform are real but modest -- any competent data migration tool handles that. And school procurement in the U.S., where the real money lives, is a brutal grind that favors incumbents with established district relationships. Going from 60% of Swedish private schools to meaningful U.S. penetration against Follett's procurement machinery is a different sport entirely.

This is a pass for me. The business model is SaaS subscriptions to schools -- a price-sensitive customer base buying software whose core differentiator is an AI capability racing toward commoditization. It's an application on existing infrastructure, not a primitive that others build on. The founders haven't demonstrated the kind of deep technical or operational credibility that would make me bet on them through the inevitable competitive response. I'd rather fund the library itself as a business with a tech layer than fund the tech layer selling to libraries.
