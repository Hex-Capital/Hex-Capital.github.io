# Q2Q -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Q2Q is that it sits squarely inside one of the most crowded, consensus-validated categories of 2025-2026: AI-powered outbound automation. 11x, Artisan, Instantly -- there's an entire ecosystem of well-funded companies automating the exact mechanics Q2Q is building (personalized email, AI calling agents, meeting booking), just aimed at a different buyer persona. Applying those mechanics to PE deal sourcing is a vertical specialization, not a contrarian insight. When I look for companies that are "not popular" and "difficult to assess," I'm looking for the kind of reaction where smart people hear the pitch and say "that's crazy." Nobody hears "AI automates deal sourcing for PE firms" and thinks it's crazy. They think it's obvious. And obvious, in my experience, means the pricing power and the defensibility have already been competed away before you even start.

When I ask myself what I always ask first -- tell me your story, not the business -- I find two very accomplished graduates of Penn's Jerome Fisher M&T program, one of the most elite dual-degree programs in the country. Brianna came through PE buyout analyst work and Jefferies investment banking. Claire came through hedge fund engineering at GAO Capital and product management at Qualtrics. These are impressive credentials, and Brianna genuinely lived inside the manual sourcing workflow she's automating. That's real founder-market fit in the professional sense. But it's not the kind of biographical thread that generates my conviction. I'm looking for the founder whose life story and the company's mission are inseparable -- the person who couldn't NOT build this because of what they've survived. What I see here is two smart, well-networked people who identified an inefficiency in their professional world and are building a tool to fix it. That's the foundation of a good business, but it's not what makes me write a check from my own money.

The economic access dimension is where this falls furthest from what I care about. When I backed Uber, I saw it as a poverty-alleviation tool -- drivers who couldn't get medallions suddenly had income. When I backed Postmates, delivery workers gained flexible employment. When I backed Affirm, people shut out of traditional credit got transparent access. Q2Q makes already-wealthy PE professionals marginally more efficient at acquiring companies. The beneficiaries are among the most privileged people in finance. I'm not saying there's no value in that -- efficiency tools matter -- but it doesn't create the kind of positive-sum economic outcome that pulls me into a deal. If anything, accelerating PE outreach to small business owners could increase acquisition pressure on founders who might prefer to stay independent, which is a dynamic I'm sensitive to.

The strongest bull case I can construct is this: Brianna's PE network gives her a real distribution wedge into a tight-knit buyer community. Search fund operators and independent sponsors are a surprisingly cohesive group, and if Q2Q delivers on booked meetings (not just data), word-of-mouth could compound quickly. The timing argument is also real -- Datasite's consolidation of Grata and SourceScrub in 2025 may create platform fatigue and openness to alternatives, especially among smaller PE shops that feel locked into expensive data subscriptions. And if Q2Q builds a genuine data flywheel around which outreach strategies yield the highest response rates across industries and geographies, that could become a moat. The AI phone agent is a differentiated feature that database incumbents would need real investment to replicate. For an investor who weights professional founder-market fit and clear TAM highly, this could be a solid seed bet. But that investor isn't me.

There's nothing here that gives me the jolt -- that feeling I had with Niantic, with Crusoe, with SpaceX. No adversity story that forged these founders for this specific fight. No weirdness that makes other investors uncomfortable. No transparency mission that unlocks access for people who currently lack it. No regulatory complexity creating a moat that scares away competitors. This is a competent team building a sensible product in a hot market, and I genuinely wish them well. It's just not my kind of bet.
