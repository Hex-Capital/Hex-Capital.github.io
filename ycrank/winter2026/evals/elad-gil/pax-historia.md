# Pax Historia -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The traction numbers are the first thing that jumps out: 35,000 daily active users built organically in roughly four months, 20 million rounds played, 100 billion AI tokens processed in a single week. For a pre-seed consumer product built by what appears to be a team of undergrads, that velocity is real and shouldn't be dismissed. But when I evaluate whether to write a check from my own money, traction at this stage answers "can this team build and ship?" -- not "is this a durable business?" AI Dungeon hit 1.5 million MAU in 2021 with a similar core loop (type words, AI generates narrative), raised modestly, and faded without becoming a generational company. The question I need answered is whether Pax Historia has a structural advantage that compounds, or whether this is a well-executed novelty riding a capability threshold that any competent team could match.

The market's structural moment is real but obvious. Two years ago, running real-time LLM-generated narratives for a consumer game at 35,000 DAU would have been economically impossible -- inference costs were too high and model quality wasn't sufficient for coherent geopolitical simulation. The Infron case study documenting a 60% cost reduction through multi-model routing is evidence of the cost curve bending. But "LLMs got cheaper and better" is not a non-obvious insight. Every AI gaming startup in the current wave is riding the same curve. This isn't the Harvey pattern, where legal AI looked impossible to most investors because they hadn't tracked the GPT scaling laws closely enough. AI-powered gaming is consensus-hot -- it appears on every VC trend deck I see. The grand strategy niche is more specific, but Paradox Interactive has already announced AI-driven procedural content generation for Europa Universalis V. When the incumbent is moving toward your approach rather than being structurally blocked from it, the window is narrower than it appears.

The most interesting structural element is the UGC preset marketplace with creator commissions -- 4,000+ community-published presets, each with 50+ plays, and creators earning 10% on token purchases from players using their content. This has the shape of a platform flywheel: creators build content, content attracts players, players generate token revenue, revenue incentivizes more creators. If this compounds, it becomes a distribution channel in the way I look for -- the initial game becomes the distribution mechanism for an expanding library of user-generated scenarios. The two community wikis and active Discord reinforce this. The Roblox comparison is structurally appropriate: Roblox's moat isn't its game engine, it's the creator ecosystem built on top of it. But Roblox's founders spent years building proprietary technology (physics engine, scripting language, moderation systems) before the flywheel kicked in. Pax Historia's core stack -- LLM inference, browser-based maps, prompt engineering for geopolitical simulation -- is assembled from generally available components. The UGC library is a real switching cost, but 4,000 presets at pre-seed isn't yet a defensible moat.

The bull case I have to take seriously: this could be the first platform that proves out AI-native gaming as a category, not a feature. If the "words to action to reaction" loop is genuinely a new game mechanic -- not just AI Dungeon with maps -- then the first team to build a creator ecosystem around it captures the category. The mobile expansion (they're hiring a Unity engineer) could unlock a much larger addressable audience. And the inference cost curve will continue declining, meaning unit economics improve structurally over time without the team doing anything. If consumer AI gaming follows the adoption pattern I've seen in other technology waves -- "overhyped and underhyped at the same time" -- then the current burst of attention might be the hype phase, but the real market could be much larger than today's niche of grand strategy enthusiasts. A world where AI-generated interactive entertainment replaces passive content consumption would be enormous.

But three structural concerns prevent me from getting to conviction. First, this is consumer entertainment, not infrastructure -- there's no regulatory moat, no enterprise switching costs, no "boring but critical" dynamic that creates the structural defensibility I consistently find in my best investments. Consumer gaming retention is notoriously fickle, and AI novelty effects decay fast. Second, the founders are genuinely junior -- Eli Bullock-Papa appears to be a recent Virginia Tech engineering grad with Capital One and Olive Garden on his resume, and Ryan Zhang's YC bio is "I like history." The execution velocity is impressive, but I've seen enough consumer products spike and fade to know that scaling from 35K DAU to a durable business requires operational maturity these founders haven't yet demonstrated. Third, the monetization remains entirely unvalidated in public data. Token-based economies in gaming can work (Roblox) or fail (most others), and without conversion rate, ARPU, or retention cohort data, I'm being asked to assume willingness-to-pay from engagement metrics alone. The gap between "people play this for free" and "people pay sustainably" is where most consumer AI products die.

The technology cycle positioning is correct -- they're building at the right moment on the inference cost curve -- but being right on timing in a consensus market is table stakes, not alpha. What I look for is being right on timing in a market that others dismiss. AI gaming is the opposite of dismissed; it's the sector every AI-curious investor wants exposure to. That doesn't make it a bad investment -- it makes it a bet where the returns accrue to execution quality rather than structural positioning. And at pre-seed, betting purely on execution quality with first-time undergraduate founders is a lower-conviction play than I typically make.
