# Vela -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Vela is the commoditization problem. An LLM-based agent that negotiates scheduling via natural language across email, SMS, WhatsApp, and phone -- that's technically reproducible by any competent team with access to frontier models and calendar APIs. When I apply the "software-driven vs. software-aware" test, Vela is automating an existing human workflow (scheduling coordination) rather than creating a fundamentally new category of activity. The underlying behavior hasn't changed -- meetings still need to be scheduled between multiple parties. The execution substrate changed from a human assistant to an LLM. That's labor substitution, which is valuable but doesn't compound the way platform businesses do. It's not quite a smart toaster, but it's closer to that end of the spectrum than I'd want.

The market's structural moment here is weak by my standards. Scheduling is not a non-obvious market. It's one of the most well-understood pain points in enterprise software -- Calendly built a $3B company around it, Clockwise raised $76M, Motion raised $102M. Every investor I know has evaluated scheduling companies. The "why now" thesis is essentially "LLMs got good enough to handle conversational negotiation," which is the same catalyst driving thousands of AI application companies across every category simultaneously. Compare this to Harvey, where the "why now" was a specific fidelity threshold crossing in a $900 billion market that most investors actively dismissed as impossible for AI. Scheduling AI is consensus, not contrarian. Nobody is arguing that LLMs can't handle scheduling -- the question is whether a standalone startup can own this before Calendly, Google, and Microsoft add it as a feature. That's not an inflection point I'm uniquely positioned to exploit; it's a race against incumbents who own the distribution and the infrastructure.

The product-to-distribution trajectory concerns me most. Scheduling is inherently transactional -- you use it when you need a meeting booked, then you're done until the next one. Where's the expansion surface? Calendly has been trying to grow beyond scheduling for years with hundreds of millions in funding and hasn't convincingly succeeded. Stripe's API created a developer relationship that enabled Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Gusto's payroll created an employer relationship that enabled HR, benefits, and compliance. What second product flows naturally through a scheduling interaction? Meeting intelligence? That's Otter and Fireflies. Calendar optimization? That's Clockwise. Communication management? That's a different company. I don't see the distribution channel forming here, and founders who can't articulate a multi-product vision from a distribution wedge are building a feature, not a platform.

The strongest bull case would require three things to be true simultaneously: (1) enterprise scheduling coordination is a much larger standalone market than current revenues of incumbents suggest -- perhaps $5B+ when you account for all the EA and coordinator labor being replaced; (2) multi-channel integration across email, SMS, WhatsApp, and phone creates a compounding operational moat through accumulated preference data and integration complexity that takes 2-3 years for incumbents to replicate; and (3) Calendly's business model mismatch -- they monetize simplicity and self-service booking links, so adding a conversational agent would cannibalize their core value proposition -- creates a genuine innovator's dilemma that buys Vela a 3-5 year window. If all three are true, this could be a Kronologic-scale outcome ($100M-$500M) with a small chance of something larger. But that's three conditions, not one, and the history of scheduling startups being acquired by platform companies (Reclaim.ai by Dropbox, Kronologic by East 11 Ventures) suggests the ceiling is acquisition, not independent category dominance.

The founders deserve credit. Gobhanu and Saatvik Korisepati co-founded SWIFTmfi as teenagers and scaled it across 77 countries -- that's real operational velocity at an absurdly young age. Saatvik completed a dual CS degree at CMU in two years with highest honors and worked at both AWS ML Supercompute and Perplexity, which is directly relevant technical depth. Gobhanu's Wharton Summa Cum Laude and BCG AI experience provide enterprise go-to-market context. The brother co-founder dynamic is actually a positive -- they've worked together since 2019 and have a tested relationship, which addresses one of the three things that kill pre-PMF companies. But strong founders in a market where incumbents own the distribution and infrastructure is a pattern I've seen end badly. The team is better than the market structure they're attacking.

The technology cycle positioning is adequate but not advantaged. They're building after LLMs crossed the conversational scheduling threshold, not ahead of it. Harvey was building legal AI tools before GPT-4 existed, positioning to capture market share the moment fidelity arrived. Vela is building after the capability already exists, alongside every other AI agent startup in YC W26. Being in the right cycle matters, but being early in the cycle matters more -- and they're not early, they're on time, which in AI applications means competing with the entire wave simultaneously.
