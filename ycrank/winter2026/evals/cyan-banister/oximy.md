# Oximy -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Oximy isn't the product or the founder -- it's the competitive landscape. Harmonic Security has raised $26 million. Noma Security has raised $132 million. Prompt Security got acquired by SentinelOne. Grip Security has $66 million. Every CISO in America is talking about "shadow AI" right now, and every enterprise security investor has this category circled on their whiteboard. When I see that level of consensus forming around a problem, when the market is already crowded with well-capitalized players, I know this isn't my kind of bet. The most promising companies I've backed were the ones nobody else wanted to fund. SpaceX when private space was considered delusional. Uber when ride-sharing was illegal. Crusoe when it was literally mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota. Oximy is entering one of the hottest categories in enterprise software in 2026. That's the opposite of the signal I've trained myself to trust.

When I turn to the founder's story, I see talent and velocity, but I'm searching for the thread that connects Naman Ambavi's life to this particular problem, and I can't find it. He built a healthtech SaaS for Indian pharmacies during college -- impressive hustle for someone that young, and the fact that he achieved SOC 2 and HIPAA certifications at Easocare shows he understands what enterprise buyers care about. Then he joined Induced AI as COO, an AI startup backed by Sam Altman, which gave him proximity to the AI ecosystem. And now he's building an AI governance platform. The trajectory reads like someone following the wave -- healthtech during the digital health boom, AI during the LLM explosion, AI governance as the regulatory apparatus catches up. That's smart pattern recognition, but it's not what I look for. I want the founder who's been thinking about this problem for years before anyone else saw it, the person whose biography makes the mission inevitable. When I backed the Contraline founder, he'd spent years in academic research on male contraception that nobody else cared about. His life and the company were inseparable. I don't get that feeling here.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. The regulatory tailwinds are real -- the EU AI Act is creating mandatory compliance requirements, NIST AI RMF gives enterprises a framework they need tooling to implement, and the "system of record" positioning is strategically smart. If Oximy becomes the place where all enterprise AI usage data lives, that's extraordinarily sticky. The category-straddling angle is interesting too: SaaS management incumbents like Zylo don't do AI-specific governance, and AI security players like Noma don't do spend tracking. Naman's compliance experience from Easocare is directly transferable. And the 3,500+ AI tool detection library, if it's robust, represents real engineering work that creates a near-term advantage. A return investor noted Naman's "execution ability and product velocity," which matters. If the market fragments enough that enterprises need a neutral third-party layer rather than relying on Microsoft or CrowdStrike to self-report AI usage, Oximy could win. But that's a lot of "ifs" in a market where incumbents with ten to fifty times the capital are already building.

What I uniquely notice -- and what a more analytically driven investor might miss -- is that Oximy is fundamentally a tool for the already-powerful to monitor and control employee behavior. It surfaces what workers are doing with AI tools so that security teams, finance teams, and governance teams can impose policy. Compare that to the pattern I've spent my career backing: Uber creating income for drivers, Affirm giving transparent credit to people who couldn't get it, Thumbtack connecting skilled tradespeople with customers, Flock Safety bringing public safety data to communities that needed it. Those companies made invisible systems visible in ways that expanded access. Oximy makes invisible systems visible too -- but for corporate compliance officers, not for the underserved. There's nothing wrong with that as a business, but it doesn't give me the feeling that this company is going to change who gets to participate in economic life.

I respect what Naman has accomplished at a young age. Starting companies as a teenager, getting into YC, building a team of five and shipping a product with real compliance certifications -- that takes drive. But at the price where I invest, with my own money, I need to feel that biographical inevitability between the founder and the problem, and I need to be backing something that other investors think is too strange or too risky. Oximy is a competent team chasing a validated market with well-funded competitors. That's someone else's bet, not mine.
