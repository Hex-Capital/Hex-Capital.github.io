# Hex Security -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps off the page before I even get to the founders: five direct competitors have collectively raised over $635 million in this exact category. Pentera is already north of $100 million in ARR. XBOW's AI agent literally holds the #1 position on HackerOne's global leaderboard. Horizon3.ai has done 100,000+ pentests and is embedded in the NSA's CAPT program. This is not an unpopular idea. This is not difficult to assess. This is not a space where other investors are scratching their heads wondering if it could work. Autonomous pentesting in 2026 is one of the most aggressively funded categories in cybersecurity -- and that's precisely the signal that tells me the opportunity I look for has already been priced in. The companies I get excited about are the ones everyone else thinks are crazy. Nobody thinks AI pentesting is crazy anymore.

When I sit down with founders, the first thing I want to hear is their story -- not the product, not the TAM slide, but the path that brought them to this exact problem. And here, that story is absent from everything I can find. Huzaifa has solid engineering pedigree -- Amazon, Capital One, a YC startup -- but nothing that connects him personally to offensive security. Ahmad dropped out of IIT Delhi at 22 and built robots, which tells me something about conviction and restlessness, and I respect that. But robotics and world models research, while intellectually interesting, doesn't tell me why security. Prama comes from Codegen and Georgia Tech CS -- capable, sure. What I'm looking for is the biographical thread that makes the founder and the problem inseparable, the way the Contraline founder had spent years in the lab on male contraception before I ever heard of the company. I want to know: did one of these founders get their company breached? Did they grow up breaking into systems? Did they experience the frustration of a useless pentest report firsthand? Maybe they did -- but nothing in the public record suggests it. Compare this to Novee's founders who came out of Unit 8200 and Talpiot, or XBOW's team built from GitHub's security engineering org. Those are founders whose biographies explain why they're building what they're building.

The bull case here isn't nothing, and I want to be honest about that. The penetration testing market is real and growing -- $2.7 billion heading to $6.25 billion, with the PTaaS segment compounding at nearly 30% annually. There's a genuine argument that a small, fast, YC-backed team could find a wedge the larger incumbents miss, particularly in serving startups and mid-market companies who can't afford Pentera's $100K average deal size. Ahmad's reinforcement learning background could yield a technically differentiated agent architecture. And they've apparently already found real vulnerabilities in real YC companies, which is something. If I squint, I can see a version of this where their RL approach creates agents that are meaningfully better at chaining exploits in novel ways, and the YC distribution flywheel gives them enough data to build a moat before the larger players notice. But that "if I squint" qualifier is doing a lot of work. I'd need to see the RL approach benchmarked against XBOW's published results, and I'd need a founder story that explains why these three people -- and not the 8200 veterans or the GitHub security team -- are going to win this fight.

Three co-founders from three different schools, three different companies, with no documented shared history. I don't know how they met, I don't know how they argue, I don't know who makes the final call when they disagree. After HQ Trivia, I probe these dynamics explicitly -- that company had perfect timing and a transformative product, and it was destroyed by an irreconcilable co-founder split. I'm not saying these three will have that problem, but I have zero signal that they've stress-tested their working relationship through real adversity. Add the "$3B+ in potential damages prevented" claim on their YC page -- that's the kind of inflated, unverifiable metric that feels more like pitch performance than authentic communication. I'd rather hear "we found a SQL injection in a YC company's production database and the CTO couldn't sleep that night" than a number designed to impress.

This is a pass for me. Not because the team isn't smart -- they clearly are. Not because the market isn't real -- it clearly is. But because everything about this opportunity runs counter to what I look for. It's consensus, not contrarian. The founders' stories don't explain the problem. The competitive landscape is brutally well-funded with teams that have deeper domain credibility. And I see no signal of the "magically weird" quality that preceded my best investments. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, people told me I was out of my mind. Nobody would say that about backing an AI pentesting startup in 2026.
