# EigenPal -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The IDP market is the wrong kind of obvious. When I see a TAM slide showing $2.3 billion growing to $43.9 billion at 25% CAGR, with Hyperscience sitting on $439 million in funding, Rossum pulling $45 million in revenue, and ABBYY posting 60% new ARR growth -- all of them actively integrating LLM capabilities into their platforms -- I'm looking at a consensus-hot market where every participant sees the same technology shift. That's the opposite of where I find asymmetric returns. The structural moment here is real -- vision-language models did cross a capability threshold for processing messy, handwritten documents without templates in 2023-2024 -- but the problem is that every incumbent and every startup in this space saw that threshold cross at the same moment. When Harvey was building legal AI workflow tools in 2022, the capability gap was still visible to almost nobody. When EigenPal is building template-free document processing in 2025-2026, ABBYY's own product roadmap already includes it. There is no information asymmetry to exploit.

The commoditization dynamic here is structural, not hypothetical. EigenPal's core value proposition -- processing arbitrary document types via LLM-powered vision rather than pre-configured templates -- depends on capabilities that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are delivering to the entire market simultaneously. Any competent engineering team with access to GPT-4V or Claude Vision can build document extraction. EigenPal's dossier acknowledges this directly: "Any team with access to commercial vision-language models can build basic document extraction." The counter-argument is that the workflow orchestration layer, compliance certifications, and on-premises deployment create defensibility. Those are real but replicable investments -- SOC II Type 2 takes months, not years, and workflow builders are engineering projects, not miracles. When the underlying capability is a commodity, the layers you build on top need to be extraordinary. I don't see evidence of that here.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is my biggest structural concern. Document processing is a workflow step, not a platform. Unlike Gusto, which starts with payroll and becomes the distribution channel for HR, benefits, and compliance products -- because every employer needs all of those things through the same relationship -- document processing doesn't naturally expand into adjacent products that flow through the same customer integration. You process invoices, you process claims, you process contracts -- but those are variations on the same product, not new products distributed through an existing channel. The open-source DOCX editor with 396 GitHub stars is a modest developer community wedge, but it doesn't change the underlying dynamic. This looks like a single-product company in a market where scale requires becoming a platform.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Two large European bank customers for loan automation at pre-seed is genuinely impressive enterprise traction. SOC II Type 2 certification is expensive and time-consuming -- most pre-seed companies don't invest in it, and it signals operational seriousness about regulated enterprise sales. Matej Novak being a three-time B2B AI founder with a prior $4 million Series A shows he knows enterprise sales cycles and has done this before. Blaszyk's Elastic and Yelp infrastructure engineering background is directly relevant to document indexing and retrieval pipelines. If EigenPal can leverage those European bank relationships into a beachhead in financial services document automation -- a vertical where regulatory switching costs are high and on-prem requirements lock out less serious competitors -- there's a path to a meaningful business. The innovator's dilemma angle is real: ABBYY and Kofax built their businesses on per-template licensing revenue, and shifting to template-free processing cannibalizes that model. But "meaningful business" and "asymmetric return" are different outcomes. The well-funded newer IDP players like Rossum and Hyperscience don't face that cannibalization constraint and are already building LLM-native capabilities. The co-founder attention split -- Novak still listed as CEO of Assetario alongside EigenPal -- adds execution risk to an already challenging competitive position.

I pass. The market is real and growing, the team has relevant credentials and early enterprise traction, but none of that changes the fundamental structural problem: this is a consensus opportunity with well-funded competitors all riding the same technology wave. There's no non-obvious insight here, no distribution moat being built, and the single miracle -- template-free document accuracy -- is being delivered by foundation model labs to EigenPal and its competitors simultaneously. A competent team in a real market without a structural edge becomes a grind, not a breakout.
