# Fed10 -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The comparison to Harvey is tempting and instructive -- but the structural dynamics are exactly inverted. When I looked at Harvey in 2022, legal AI was impossible at that moment and would become possible in 12-18 months. The team was building ahead of a capability curve I could see inflecting. Fed10 is building *after* the capability curve has already crossed. LLMs analyzing structured legislative text -- which is more formulaic and publicly available than legal contracts -- has been feasible since GPT-4 shipped in early 2023. That's not a "why now." That's a "why not two years ago." The tell is the competitive landscape: USLege raised $2.7M in May 2025, Plural Policy was acquired for its AI regulatory intelligence in December 2025, and both FiscalNote and Quorum shipped AI modules in 2024-2025. When multiple competitors have already recognized and funded the same opportunity, you're not at a non-obvious inflection point -- you're at consensus.

The market archetype is more interesting than the timing. Policy consulting is genuinely boring -- the kind of category most VCs would reflexively dismiss. $500/hour consultants analyzing state legislation is not going to make the cover of TechCrunch. I've consistently found value in these markets others ignore. But the "boring but critical" pattern that produced Gusto and PagerDuty worked because the addressable population was enormous: every employer needs payroll, every software company needs alerting. The addressable population for legislative monitoring is structurally smaller -- corporate government affairs teams, trade associations, lobbying firms. The $5.24 billion federal lobbying figure is misleading as a TAM; most of that spend is relationship management, advocacy, and campaign activity, not analysis. The actual monitoring and analysis budget across these organizations is likely in the low hundreds of millions. That's a real market, but it's a $200-400 million market, not a multi-billion dollar one -- and the incumbents already hold most of it.

The strongest bull case here is the product-to-distribution angle. The "lobbyist CRM" framing caught my attention because it suggests the founders are thinking beyond analysis output into workflow infrastructure. If Fed10 can wedge in with policy briefs and expand into stakeholder mapping, advocacy campaign management, legislative workflow orchestration -- basically becoming the operating system for government affairs teams -- that's a genuine distribution trajectory. Quorum has already proven this multi-product expansion works in the category, growing from legislative tracking to a $61 million revenue integrated advocacy platform. The innovator's dilemma is real too: FiscalNote sells human analyst overlays as an upsell, which means deploying autonomous AI analysis would cannibalize their own professional services revenue. That business model tension creates a window. But I have no evidence the Fed10 founders have articulated this expansion path. The CRM language on the website could be marketing copy rather than strategic architecture.

The founder-market fit has a genuine signal. These are not career technologists who discovered lobbying was an addressable market -- they're former lobbyists who passed legislation together in Nevada before any of them could legally drink. Armand Iorgulescu drafted recommendations signed into law as the youngest Governor appointee in the state. That's the kind of domain expertise that lets you evaluate whether AI output meets the standard a $500/hour consultant would deliver. But domain expertise in policy is not the same as execution velocity in software. I see no evidence of shipped product, user traction, or rapid iteration cycles. The team has a UX Lead, which suggests product development is underway, but at pre-seed with no public product signals, I'm scoring on potential rather than demonstrated velocity.

The commoditization risk is what ultimately makes this a pass for me. The core technology -- an LLM reading legislative text and producing policy briefs -- can be replicated by any competent team with access to foundation models and state legislature data feeds, which are public. Fed10's miracle isn't technology; it's distribution. They need to get enterprises to buy from a three-person pre-seed startup over FiscalNote (2,000+ customers, Fortune 100 penetration) and Quorum ($61M revenue, integrated advocacy suite). That's a distribution miracle in a market where the incumbents have years of embedded relationships with exactly the customers Fed10 needs to reach. When I funded Harvey, the miracle was model fidelity -- and it was being delivered by OpenAI, not Harvey, which let the team focus entirely on workflow and enterprise trust. Fed10 doesn't have an equivalent external force delivering their critical miracle. They need to build distribution from scratch against entrenched competitors in a market that rewards relationships and trust. That's not one miracle -- it's the kind of compounding obstacle set I avoid.

For this to work, you'd need to believe that the quality gap between AI-generated policy briefs and incumbent dashboard-plus-search products is so large that it drives rapid switching despite entrenched relationships -- and that Fed10 can capture this switching before USLege, FiscalNote's AI modules, and Quorum's AI features close the gap. I don't have evidence for either belief. The founders are promising and the market is authentically boring, but the structural moment has already been recognized and the defensibility is thin. I'd want to see a working product with even a handful of paying customers, or a distribution insight I haven't considered, before putting my own money in.
