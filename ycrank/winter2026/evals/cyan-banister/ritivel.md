# Ritivel -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that hits me immediately: this is one of the most consensus spaces I've seen in a while. AI for regulatory document writing in pharma already has Yseop with $22 million in funding and 150 clinical trials behind them — they won TIME's Best Inventions in 2025. Certara, a public company, launched CoAuthor two years ago. Deep Intelligent Pharma has raised over $110 million. McKinsey literally co-built a CSR writing platform with Merck. When I say the most promising companies are not popular and are difficult to assess, I mean exactly the opposite of this. Every large consulting firm, every incumbent regulatory platform, and multiple well-funded startups are converging on the same insight at the same time. That's not a signal that excites me — that's the signal that tells me the weirdness has already been priced in and the arbitrage is gone.

And then I look at the founders' stories, and I can't find the thread that connects them to this specific problem. Pavan Kalyan Tankala is clearly technically sharp — NeurIPS publications, SIGMOD workshops, Columbia CS — but he came from Hevo Data, a data pipeline company. Gunin Gupta is from management consulting at Kearney. Nirmit Arora has ML projects on GitHub. These are accomplished young engineers and a consultant who identified a market opportunity through research — "50+ conversations with pharma professionals" — rather than founders who lived inside the regulatory writing trenches and felt the absurdity firsthand. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone would listen. That biographical commitment is what I'm listening for, and I don't hear it here. The partially unverified Microsoft Research claim also nags at me — the YC description says they "previously built AI copilots at Microsoft Research," but public sources can only confirm a Microsoft internship for one founder and an unspecified connection for another. I prize raw authenticity over curated narrative, and credential ambiguity undermines that.

The bull case deserves real engagement, because the problem is genuinely painful and the economics are staggering. If each month of drug delay costs $45 million in lost revenue, even a modest acceleration of regulatory submissions creates enormous customer willingness to pay. The local-deployment, zero-data-retention architecture is smart — it addresses the actual security objection that blocks AI adoption in pharma, and that's the kind of detail that suggests the team has done real diligence on the problem. The Veeva and SharePoint integrations lower adoption friction. And pharma regulatory complexity does create a moat for whoever gets embedded first. If Ritivel can land two or three enterprise customers before the bigger players lock them out, the switching costs in this domain are real. What would have to be true for this to work: they'd need to be meaningfully faster to market than the funded competitors, their local deployment would need to be the deciding factor for security-conscious buyers, and the founding team would need to develop the kind of pharma domain expertise through customer intimacy that their backgrounds don't currently demonstrate. It's possible, but it requires winning a foot race against competitors who started running earlier and with more resources.

What I notice through my own lens is the absence of an economic access dimension. This makes large pharmaceutical companies more efficient at filing regulatory documents. There's a distant, second-order argument that faster drug approvals help patients, but the direct beneficiary is some of the wealthiest corporations on earth optimizing an internal workflow. Compare that to Affirm, which put transparent credit directly in the hands of people who were being exploited by hidden fees, or Uber, which created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. I invest in companies that create positive-sum economic outcomes for people who currently lack access. Enterprise efficiency software for pharma, however well-executed, doesn't light that fire for me.

The regulatory complexity dimension is where Ritivel scores highest in my framework. Pharma is genuinely hard — the sales cycles are brutal, the compliance requirements are real, and the consequences of errors in regulatory submissions are severe. I respect founders who walk into that kind of difficulty rather than building another SaaS tool in an unregulated space. But comfort with complexity alone isn't enough. I need the founder story, the non-consensus conviction, and the sense that this company is creating something the world needs for people who don't currently have access to it. What I see instead is a competent team that identified a real but well-mapped opportunity and is entering a market that multiple well-funded players have already validated. That's conviction-by-consensus, not conviction-before-consensus, and it's not how I invest.
