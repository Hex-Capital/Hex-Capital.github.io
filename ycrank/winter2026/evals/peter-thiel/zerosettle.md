# ZeroSettle -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is what secret it possesses -- what important truth about the world does this founder see that most intelligent people actively reject? With ZeroSettle, the answer is immediate and disqualifying: there is no secret. The thesis -- that iOS developers resent Apple's 30% commission and would prefer to pay less -- is perhaps the single most consensus opinion in all of software development. A federal judge created this market opportunity in open court in April 2025. Every developer, every payment company, every VC in Silicon Valley read the same ruling on the same day. Within weeks, Paddle and RevenueCat announced a joint solution. Appcharge raised $58 million. Neon secured backing from Thrive Capital and a16z. Stripe published documentation for iOS external payments. When a market is born from a public legal ruling, it is the definitional opposite of a secret -- it is a starting gun that every competitor hears simultaneously. The result is predictable mimetic convergence: five funded companies rushing to build the same thing, imitating each other's positioning, competing on integration time and fee structures. This is not a zero-to-one company. This is a race to build a slightly better wrapper around Stripe.

The competitive dynamics are the Girardian nightmare in its purest form. Paddle alone has raised $293 million and generates $90 million in revenue. RevenueCat has $119 million in funding and already manages subscriptions for thousands of apps. Together, their partnership addresses the exact same market ZeroSettle targets -- iOS alternative billing with MoR compliance. Appcharge processes over $500 million in annual DTC transactions for mobile games. ZeroSettle has 8 GitHub stars. The argument that ZeroSettle's single-SDK approach beats Paddle+RevenueCat's two-vendor integration is a 2x improvement at best, not a 10x discontinuity. A slightly cleaner integration is an execution advantage, not a structural moat. Any competent engineering team can build an SDK that syncs products from App Store Connect and presents a paywall. The MoR compliance layer -- tax remittance across 190 countries, chargebacks, fraud -- is operationally demanding but not proprietary. Paddle, FastSpring, and Lemon Squeezy already do this for digital products. ZeroSettle is not creating a new capability that did not previously exist; it is assembling existing components into a marginally more convenient package in a market where half a dozen companies are doing the same thing.

The founders deserve credit for relevant domain expertise. Both worked at Apple on systems-level software -- operating systems, battery management, thermals. They understand the platform from the inside, which matters for navigating Apple's evolving guidelines and building a compliant SDK. Leaving Apple to help developers escape Apple's payment system shows some intellectual independence. But domain expertise is not the same as a definite vision for the future. The cryptocurrency tag on their YC page and the unexplained "ZeroSettleEscrowKit" repository containing "all escrow and crypto sources" suggest either unfocused ambition or a pivot-ready mindset -- the antithesis of definite optimism. A founder with true conviction would have one clear thesis, not a payment MoR that also might be a crypto escrow platform. The "Founding Partner Program" offering free access for two years reads as customer development iteration, not a confident plan to dominate a specific market.

The strongest bull case requires believing that ZeroSettle can win through speed and developer experience before the incumbents' products mature -- the Stripe analogy, where a small team with a beautiful API captures developer loyalty before the giants react. But the analogy fails on the crucial dimension. When the Collison brothers built Stripe, their secret was genuinely contrarian: the consensus held that payment integration was necessarily complex, involving enterprise sales and lengthy onboarding. Stripe's insight -- that developers should accept payments with seven lines of code -- was rejected by every incumbent. No one in the payment industry believed it was possible or desirable to make payments that simple. ZeroSettle's thesis enjoys no such resistance. Everyone agrees that bypassing the App Store tax is desirable. Everyone is building toward it. The other condition that would strengthen the bull case -- that Apple's regulatory battles permanently open the alternative billing market -- is itself uncertain. The December 2025 appeals court ruling suggesting Apple can charge a "reasonable commission" on external transactions threatens the entire value proposition. If that reasonable commission lands at 20% (as Apple already imposes in the EU under the DMA), the savings from using ZeroSettle shrink to the point where the integration effort may not be worth it. The company's existence is contingent on regulatory outcomes it cannot influence.

This is ultimately a 1-to-n company in a competitive market with no path to monopoly. There are no network effects -- one developer using ZeroSettle does not make it better for the next. There are no meaningful economies of scale that ZeroSettle possesses and Paddle does not. The technology is competent engineering, not a discontinuity. The founders are capable but have not articulated a vision that transcends "help developers save money on Apple's fees." The market they are entering will be defined by price competition and feature parity -- exactly the dynamics that destroy value for everyone involved. I pass.
