## The Idea

**Problem:** Medical spas operate using fragmented software stacks — separate tools for scheduling, CRM, charting, inventory, marketing analytics, and payroll. This fragmentation makes it difficult for medspa operators to connect ad spend to patient lifetime value, manage provider qualifications alongside scheduling, or track inventory in real time. Current solutions either serve general salon/spa needs (Vagaro, Mangomint) or focus on enterprise-scale wellness chains (Zenoti), leaving a gap for purpose-built, AI-native medspa software.

**Approach:** Tepali consolidates six core medspa functions into a single platform: marketing intelligence (connecting ad spend across Meta and Google Ads to patient LTV and cost-per-acquisition), smart scheduling (provider-aware appointment matching by treatment qualifications, self-booking with deposit capture, automated reminders), patient CRM (full journey tracking from ad click, source attribution, treatment history, automated re-booking nudges), team management (shift scheduling, time tracking, payroll, multi-location support), digital charting (treatment-specific documentation with injection maps, photo documentation, HIPAA-compliant records), and inventory tracking (real-time stock levels, reorder alerts, expiry tracking, vendor management). An AI assistant layer allows natural language queries across the entire dataset (tepali.com).

**Differentiation:** Compared to general salon/spa platforms like Vagaro or Mangomint, Tepali is purpose-built for medspas — including medspa-specific features such as injection maps, HIPAA-compliant digital charting, and provider qualification-based scheduling. Compared to AestheticsPro, which also targets medspas, Tepali differentiates on the AI-native layer and closed-loop marketing attribution (connecting ad clicks directly to patient revenue and LTV). Compared to Boulevard, which targets premium self-care businesses broadly, Tepali narrows its focus to medical aesthetics. Compared to Zenoti, which serves enterprise multi-location chains, Tepali appears to target smaller and mid-market medspa operators.

**Business Model:** No pricing information is publicly available on tepali.com. The site offers "Get Early Access" via a booking link (cal.com/chrisvin/tepali). [Inferred]: Most likely monetization path is a SaaS subscription (monthly per-location fee), potentially with a payments/fintech layer given the "Fintech" tag on its YC profile, which could include payment processing fees or embedded lending/financing for patients.

**TAM/SAM:** The global medical spa management software market was valued at $294.46 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 13.74% through 2030 (Grand View Research, 2024 via search snippet). The U.S. medical spa management software market was estimated at $118.1 million in 2023, projected at 13.6% CAGR through 2030 (Grand View Research, 2024 via search snippet). The broader global medical spa market was $21.21 billion in 2024, projected to reach $78.23 billion by 2033 at 15.77% CAGR (Grand View Research, 2024 via search snippet). A separate report valued the global medical spa software market at $338.8 million in 2024 with 13.9% CAGR through 2034 (The Insight Partners, 2024 via search snippet).

**GTM / Distribution:** The "Get Early Access" call-to-action links to a personal Calendly-style booking page (cal.com/chrisvin/tepali), indicating a founder-led sales approach at this stage (tepali.com). [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct outreach to independent medspa owners and small chains, given the product's feature set targets operational pain points across the full medspa workflow. The YC network and Demo Day may serve as initial customer acquisition channels.

## Defensibility

No defensibility signals found in public sources at this stage. [Inferred]: Potential moat could develop via (1) data network effects — as more medspas use the platform, aggregated marketing performance data (e.g., ad spend benchmarks, treatment pricing optimization) could become a proprietary advantage; (2) switching costs — consolidating six software functions into one creates high migration cost once a medspa's operations, patient records, and financial data are embedded in the platform; (3) vertical depth — deep medspa-specific features (injection maps, provider qualification matching, HIPAA charting) are harder for horizontal platforms to replicate without cannibalizing their broader market positioning. None of these moats are proven at this stage.

**Market structure:** Horizontal salon/spa platforms (Vagaro, Mangomint) would need to add complex medical features (HIPAA compliance, charting, injection documentation) to compete directly, which increases their regulatory burden and complicates their simpler value proposition for non-medical customers. Enterprise platforms like Zenoti are optimized for large multi-location chains and may find it uneconomical to serve smaller medspas. [Inferred]: The structural barrier is the medical compliance layer — general salon software companies risk alienating their core non-medical customer base by adding HIPAA-compliant EMR features, while EMR companies lack the marketing attribution and consumer booking functionality.

**Commoditization risk:** The individual features (scheduling, CRM, charting, inventory) are well-established software categories with many providers. The combination into a single medspa-specific platform is replicable by well-funded competitors like Boulevard (which raised $80M in Series D and is expanding into medspa). AestheticsPro already offers a similar all-in-one medspa platform. The AI layer and marketing attribution features could be differentiated if executed well, but LLM-based query interfaces are becoming commoditized across vertical SaaS.

- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/chrisvinjabamani (chrisvin.nyc)
- GitHub: github.com/chrisvin-jabamani — repos include lotus-mcp (MCP server for browser automation) and terminal-reader-mcp (GitHub via search snippet); earlier GitHub account github.com/Chrisvin has 18 repos including Android libraries (LiquidSwipe, EasyReveal, ConcentricOnboarding) in Kotlin (GitHub via search snippet)

**Vishnu Pathmanaban** — Co-founder
- LinkedIn directory shows 2 profiles under this name (LinkedIn via search snippet); specific profile details not publicly accessible
- No additional background, education, or career history found in public sources
- Twitter/X: No public account found
- LinkedIn: Not confirmed beyond directory listing
- GitHub: No public repos found

**Co-founder relationship:** Both founders are listed as co-founders on the YC page. No shared employer or university overlap is identifiable from available data, as Vishnu Pathmanaban's background is not publicly documented.

**Founder-market fit:** Chrisvin Jabamani brings a finance and operations background (investment banking at PJT Partners, business operations at Rilla) that is relevant to building financial and operational software. His experience at Rilla, an AI-powered sales coaching platform, provides exposure to vertical AI SaaS and the GTM challenges of selling to fragmented SMB markets. His GitHub history shows programming capability across both mobile (Kotlin/Android) and AI tooling (MCP servers). Vishnu Pathmanaban's background and specific domain expertise are not publicly documented, making it difficult to assess complementary skills.

## Key Risks

**Direct competitor momentum:** Boulevard raised $80M in Series D (July 2025) specifically to expand into medspas with AI features (TechCrunch, Jul 2025 via search snippet), and AestheticsPro is an established medspa-specific incumbent. Tepali is entering a market where well-funded competitors are actively converging on the same vertical.

**Incomplete founding team visibility:** One of two co-founders (Vishnu Pathmanaban) has minimal public professional footprint, making it difficult to assess technical depth, domain expertise, or team complementarity from public sources. For a 2-person team, each founder's capabilities are critical.

**Product naming ambiguity:** The company's email domain appears to be uselotus.ai (per chrisvin.nyc), the GitHub repo is named "lotus-mcp," yet the YC listing and product website use "Tepali." This suggests a recent rename from "Lotus" that may create brand confusion or SEO challenges during early customer acquisition.

**No evident medspa domain expertise:** Neither founder's public background includes direct medspa industry experience (clinical, operational, or as a medspa owner). The team's strengths appear to be in finance, operations, and software engineering rather than healthcare or medical aesthetics.

**HIPAA compliance burden:** Tepali markets HIPAA-compliant digital charting as a core feature. For a 2-person pre-seed team, maintaining HIPAA compliance (security audits, BAAs, breach notification procedures, encryption standards) is a significant ongoing operational and legal cost.
