# Q2Q -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is the archetype of the company I pass on. Two smart founders from Penn's best dual-degree program, attacking a problem one of them lived through as a PE analyst, using off-the-shelf AI components to make an existing workflow faster. Everything about it is sensible. The market exists. The pain is real. The team maps to the problem. And none of that matters, because the question I ask first is: if Q2Q succeeds completely -- captures every PE firm, every search fund, every independent sponsor -- does the world operate differently? The answer is no. Private equity firms still acquire companies the same way. They just find targets with fewer junior analysts. The consequence of success is a nice SaaS business in a narrow vertical. Nobody's life changes at scale. No system gets disrupted. They've engineered out the risk of failure and, in doing so, engineered out anything worth succeeding at.

The technology concern compounds the ambition problem. The dossier states it plainly: "The underlying components -- company database access, email personalization via LLMs, AI voice agents, calendar booking -- are individually available as APIs and tools." Q2Q is an integration play, not a technology breakthrough. There is no proprietary science here, no defensible technical moat, no capability that didn't exist six months ago. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu was building router architecture that Cisco's CTO said was impossible -- the technology itself was the contrarian bet. Q2Q is assembling commercially available APIs into a workflow. Datasite just spent $500 million acquiring Grata and SourceScrub and has explicitly signaled intent to build an end-to-end platform. A well-resourced incumbent adding outbound automation as a feature is not a matter of if but when. Q2Q is building a feature, not a company that makes the incumbent approach obsolete.

Brianna Lin's PE background is simultaneously the strongest and most concerning signal. She lived the deal sourcing pain at a buyout firm and at Jefferies -- she knows exactly where the workflow breaks. That's genuine founder-market fit. But it's also the insider pattern I've learned to be skeptical of. Industry veterans build what the industry already wants, which is the existing system made 30% more efficient. They know what's painful but not what's possible beyond the current paradigm. The most transformative companies in finance -- Square, Stripe, Affirm -- were built by people who looked at the financial system from outside and asked why it existed in its current form at all. Square didn't optimize point-of-sale terminals; it made them irrelevant. Q2Q optimizes analyst workflows. That's the difference between disruption and incrementalism.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: that PE deal sourcing is the beachhead into automating all of deal intermediation (a much larger market), that the data flywheel from outreach campaigns creates a durable moat that commoditized components cannot replicate, and that Datasite's consolidation actually opens doors rather than closing them. If all three are true, Q2Q could become the operating system for private capital deal flow -- and that would be a meaningfully larger consequence. The timing tailwind is real: LLMs crossed the quality threshold for personalized business outreach in 2024-2025, and 49% of dealmakers report using AI tools almost daily. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders are thinking at that larger scale. The positioning is "help PE teams find acquisition targets faster" -- that's a workflow improvement, not a vision for transforming how capital allocation works. The founders would need to articulate why this is the beginning of making the entire deal intermediation layer obsolete, and I see no evidence of that ambition.

I tell founders like this the same thing: you are too talented to spend your careers making a process 30% cheaper for people who can already afford it. Private equity firms have money. They can hire analysts. The problem Q2Q solves is real but not important at the scale that justifies the founders' ability. Go find something where success means the existing system cannot survive -- where the technology doesn't optimize the workflow but eliminates the need for it entirely.
