# Chamber -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Chamber: this is the opposite of unpopular. GPU infrastructure optimization is arguably the single hottest category in enterprise tech right now. Every fund I talk to is looking for exactly this deal -- teams solving GPU utilization waste, AI infrastructure efficiency, the whole stack. When I read that Chamber is positioning around "$240 billion in wasted compute," I don't feel the jolt of discovering something nobody else sees. I feel the overcrowded buzz of a category where consensus has already formed. The "agentic AI-enabled" language on the YC page is market-timing vocabulary -- it's what you say when you want to ride the wave, not when you've arrived at an insight independently that sounds ridiculous to everyone else. When I backed SpaceX, people thought private space was genuinely insane. When I first heard about Crusoe Energy mining Bitcoin on gas flares, it sounded absurd to sophisticated investors. Chamber doesn't sound absurd to anyone. It sounds like exactly what a smart team of ex-Amazon engineers would build in 2025 because the market is screaming for it. And that's precisely the signal that makes me cautious.

The founders' story tells me something important, and it's not what most investors would hear. The press coverage says "three fellow Amazon veterans left their own comfortable positions" to join Charles Ding. That phrase -- "comfortable positions" -- is the tell. These are talented engineers who saw a problem they knew how to solve from inside one of the world's most capable infrastructure organizations. Charles Ding has real startup experience from Bungee Tech, scaling to 30+ engineers and raising over $3 million, which shows he can build and lead. Andreas Bloomquist literally presented CloudWatch Application Signals at AWS re:Invent. The domain fit is tight -- maybe too tight. What I'm not hearing is the story underneath the resume. What I always ask founders is: tell me how you got here, not the business version, the real version. What broke you or changed you or kept you up at night before any of this was a company? I don't see that biographical thread connecting these founders to GPU waste as a problem they were born to solve. They're solving it because they're qualified to. That's a meaningful difference in my framework. The founders who persist through the darkest moments -- when the company is bleeding out, when NVIDIA undercuts you with a free product, when your enterprise deals stall for six months -- are the ones whose identity is fused with the problem, not just their skillset.

The competitive dynamics here are genuinely interesting and worth a paragraph because they're more nuanced than they appear. NVIDIA acquiring Run:ai for roughly $700 million and then open-sourcing it creates a structural vacuum -- there's no independent commercial vendor-neutral GPU orchestration platform anymore. Chamber is positioning into that gap. The bull case is compelling: enterprise customers with multi-cloud and on-prem GPU clusters may specifically want a solution not controlled by their primary hardware vendor. That's a real tension in procurement decisions. And the open-source alternatives -- Volcano, Kueue -- are scheduler primitives, not autonomous orchestration platforms. If Chamber can build a genuine data flywheel from fleet telemetry across hundreds of GPU clusters, feeding predictive models that get better with every deployment, that could be a defensible moat. The Carta analogy works here on the surface -- making an opaque system (GPU utilization across teams and clusters) transparent and manageable. If I squint, I can see a version of this that looks like Carta for compute. But that vision requires Chamber to win enterprise deals against a free NVIDIA-backed alternative with a four-person team, which is an execution challenge that demands extraordinary founder resilience.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? Three things: First, that NVIDIA's open-sourcing of Run:ai actually weakens rather than strengthens Run:ai's position -- that enterprises distrust NVIDIA controlling their orchestration layer the way they distrusted Salesforce controlling their CRM data in the early days. Second, that the "agentic" differentiation is real and defensible -- that autonomous orchestration with self-healing and demand forecasting creates a genuine technical moat that open-source projects can't replicate in two years. Third, that this team can execute enterprise sales at scale while simultaneously building that technical moat with four people. If all three are true, this could be a significant company in a massive market. But "could be significant in a massive market with strong execution" is a description that fits dozens of well-credentialed YC companies every batch. The question I always come back to is: what makes this company difficult to assess and unpopular? And the honest answer is that it's neither. It's straightforward to assess and popular with everyone I know.

I want to be clear -- I'm not saying this is a bad company. The team is credentialed, the market is enormous, the timing with the Run:ai vacuum is sharp, and the product-led growth motion through free monitoring is smart infrastructure GTM. A lot of investors will write this check happily. But I invest my own money based on whether I feel something most investors miss, and what I feel here is the absence of what I look for most: a founder whose personal history made this inevitable, an idea that makes sophisticated people uncomfortable, and a product that creates economic access for people who don't currently have it. Chamber saves money for organizations spending billions on GPUs. That's valuable. But it's not the kind of value that keeps me up at night imagining what the world looks like if they succeed.
