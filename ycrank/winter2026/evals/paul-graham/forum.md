# Forum -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Forum is that four other companies are building the same thing at the same time. Noise.xyz raised $7.1 million from Paradigm and already has 1,300 beta users. Polymarket is adding attention markets in March with Kaito's data. Zora launched on Solana two weeks ago. When I see four well-funded teams converging on an identical concept within the same six-month window, that tells me something important: this is a consensus idea. Attention trading is the kind of concept that sounds profound in a pitch meeting — "attention is the new oil" — and that's exactly why it should make you nervous. The best startup ideas don't arrive as a category wave with multiple entrants. They arrive as a single founder saying "I built this because I needed it and nobody else would."

How did these founders find this problem? Owen Botkin worked long/short equities at Balyasny, a serious hedge fund. That gives him real knowledge of market microstructure and trading infrastructure. But the path from "I traded equities at a multi-strat fund" to "let's build an exchange for attention" doesn't have the organic quality I look for. There's no visible moment of personal pain — no equivalent of Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive or the Airbnb founders needing to make rent. It reads more like someone with finance expertise scanning the landscape, seeing prediction markets explode 400% in 2025, seeing social data APIs mature, and combining the two into a startup concept. That's the brainstorming-session failure mode. Smart people with relevant skills generating an idea that sounds like it should exist, rather than discovering through lived frustration that it must exist.

The bull case rests on regulatory schlep as a moat, and I want to take this seriously because it's the strongest argument. Getting CFTC designation as a Designated Contract Market is genuinely painful — Kalshi spent years and millions doing it. If Forum pulls this off, every crypto-native competitor is structurally locked out of the U.S. regulated market. Institutional money — hedge funds, media companies wanting to hedge cultural exposure — can only flow through a regulated exchange. That's a real structural advantage, and it's the kind of tedious regulatory work that most founders instinctively avoid. In that narrow sense, there's a schlep here. But the analogy to Stripe breaks down in a critical way: Stripe solved a problem that every programmer already experienced daily. The demand was proven and enormous; the schlep was in the execution. Forum needs to simultaneously create demand for a new asset class AND navigate the regulatory schlep. That's two miracles, not one. Every programmer wanted easier payments before Stripe existed. It's not clear that anyone needs to go long or short on cultural attention in a way that existing instruments don't already serve.

The founding team has the right shape on paper — finance CEO, engineering CTO. Joseph Thomas's background at NASA and DreamwaveAI suggests technical capability. Both dropped out of university to build this, which shows commitment. But there's almost nothing visible to evaluate. No public GitHub repos. The website returned a placeholder page. No user counts, no waitlist numbers, no community channels. At pre-seed I don't penalize thin traction, but the complete absence of any observable product — combined with competitors who already have live users and retention data — is concerning. Noise has 62% retention on 1,300 users. Forum has a simulated-currency product that nobody outside the team appears to be using in any measurable way. The gap between where Forum stands and where its funded competitors already are is wider than I'd expect for a company entering YC.

What would have to be true for this to work? Three things: the CFTC approves attention-based contracts under the current permissive leadership before the political winds shift, Forum establishes itself as the benchmark index provider (the "S&P 500 of attention") before Kalshi or a traditional exchange decides to move into the space, and institutional demand for attention hedging turns out to be real and large. If all three happen, Forum could be the regulated monopoly exchange for a genuinely new asset class, which would be enormously valuable. But that's three independent conditions, each uncertain, and the product of three probabilities is always smaller than any individual one. I've written about this — when a startup needs more than one miracle, the math works against it fast.

This is a pass for me. The idea doesn't emerge from organic necessity. The category is consensus, not contrarian. The competitive landscape is crowded with better-capitalized players who have a head start. And the regulatory dependency introduces a timeline risk that could leave Forum burning cash for years before generating a dollar of revenue. Owen's finance background is genuine, and the regulatory moat argument has intellectual merit, but I need to see founders who discovered a problem rather than designed one, and evidence that someone actually wants this specific product from this specific team.
