# Squid -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Grid planning software is one of those problems that has been staring at the entire energy industry for twenty years. Every planning engineer at every utility knows the workflow is broken — spreadsheets emailed between teams, conflicting model versions, PDF exports from desktop tools built in the 1990s. PSS/E, CYME, Synergi — these are not beloved products. They're tolerated products. The reason nobody has built the browser-native collaborative replacement isn't that the opportunity is invisible. It's that the schlep is so ugly — power systems physics, utility data formats across jurisdictions, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, twelve-month procurement cycles with risk-averse buyers — that most founders' unconscious minds filter the idea out before it even forms. That's what makes Squid interesting to me. This is a textbook schlep blindness opportunity.

The organic discovery here is about as clean as I see at pre-seed. Both founders worked at Octopus Energy. Jones also worked at National Grid. Kolokotronis was Head of Technology at Octopus Energy and before that built VoltQuant, a geospatial grid intelligence startup that had National Grid as a customer. These founders didn't read a market report about grid modernization and decide to start a company. They sat in the rooms where grid planning actually happens. They saw the emails with the wrong spreadsheet attached. They dealt with the conflicting model versions. When Doerte Schneemann at National Grid DSO says "for too long flex data lived in spreadsheets," she's describing a pain that Jones and Kolokotronis experienced from the inside for years. The idea grew from their working lives, not from a brainstorming session.

Kolokotronis is the founder who catches my attention. He's a second-time cleantech founder — VoltQuant was in the same grid-data space, raised about £930K, and had both National Grid and Octopus Energy as customers. That company gave him deep knowledge of utility buying patterns, grid data challenges, and the competitive landscape. Now he's back with better aim. This is the pattern I've seen work before — founders who did a first attempt in a domain, learned what actually matters, and came back focused on the right wedge. He has a Cambridge engineering degree, ran AI/Data GTM at AWS, and was Head of Technology at Octopus. Jones complements with BCG strategy experience plus direct operational stints at both National Grid and Octopus. The co-founder relationship predates the startup — they overlapped at Octopus Energy and share a professional network through the UK energy sector. That matters. Co-founders who met at a hackathon to start a company together have a different failure rate than co-founders who worked together first.

What's genuinely impressive for a two-person pre-seed company is the FlexPortal launch with National Grid DSO. This is not a logo on a slide deck — it's a live, publicly launched product with press coverage in three energy trade publications and an executive quote. Getting a product into production at a major grid operator is hard even for well-funded companies with sales teams. Doing it as a two-person startup suggests the founders' domain relationships translate into real deployment, not just meetings. The SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications are another signal — achieving those as a team of two is an enormous amount of compliance work, and it signals that they understand what enterprise utility buyers actually require before they'll sign.

The bear case is real and worth stating plainly. Utility procurement cycles are long. The website says "Coming Soon" at $0, and there's no public revenue data. The FlexPortal could be a free pilot rather than a paid contract. Neara just raised $90M at a billion-dollar valuation, and well-funded adjacent players could decide collaborative planning is the next feature they build. The UK-to-US market translation — different regulatory frameworks, different grid architectures — adds friction. And enterprise software companies selling to utilities can burn through years of runway before hitting meaningful revenue. The default-alive question is sharp: can two people in San Francisco sustain the long sales cycles that utility software demands? These aren't small risks.

But the structural advantage cuts both ways. The same long sales cycles and compliance requirements that threaten Squid's runway also protect it once inside. Utilities don't rip out their planning infrastructure on a whim. If Squid becomes the single network model of record for a utility — the place where version history, institutional knowledge, and planning assumptions live — switching costs compound over time. The legacy vendors face a classic innovator's dilemma: rebuilding PSS/E as browser-native collaborative SaaS would cannibalize Siemens' perpetual license revenue. Envelio, the most direct modern competitor, got acquired by E.ON, which limits its addressability — E.ON's competitors won't want to run on E.ON's software. The timing is right: electrification from EVs, heat pumps, and data centers is straining grid capacity in ways that demand faster, more collaborative planning. The old tools were built for a slower world.

This is the kind of company I find myself drawn to — a genuine problem hiding behind an enormous schlep, discovered by founders who lived inside it, with a technical co-founder who built a previous company in the same space and came back sharper. The absence of revenue data is the main thing keeping my conviction below the highest tier, because at some point the question of whether utilities will actually pay — not just pilot — has to be answered.
