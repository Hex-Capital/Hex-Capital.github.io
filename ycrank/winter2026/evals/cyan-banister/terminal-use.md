# Terminal Use -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me immediately: Terminal Use is calling itself "Vercel for background agents," and Vercel is actively building that exact capability right now. That's not a positioning strategy — that's painting a target on your own back and handing the bow to someone with $250 million in funding and one of the most loyal developer communities on the planet. When I invested in Uber, no one else wanted to touch ride-sharing. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, the idea of private rockets was literally a punchline. The companies I get excited about are the ones other investors think are absurd. AI agent infrastructure in February 2026 is the opposite of absurd — it's the single hottest category in venture capital. E2B has $21 million and claims 88% of the Fortune 100 signed up. Daytona hit a million dollars in ARR in under three months with $31 million raised. Modal Labs is valued at over a billion. Everyone and their cousin wants to fund agent infrastructure right now, which means the weirdness has been completely arbitraged away, and I'm almost certainly not the right investor for this.

The founders are three ex-Palantir engineers — Filip, Stavros, and Vivek — who went to university together and then worked at one of the most demanding enterprise software companies in the world. That's a respectable pedigree. Vivek specifically led the technical delivery of what the YC page describes as one of the largest agent use cases across US hospitals at Palantir, which gives him genuine firsthand experience with the deployment pain they're trying to solve. But when I think about the founders I've backed who became extraordinary — when I think about the kind of person who makes me want to drop everything and work for them — the signal I'm looking for isn't professional competence. It's the biographical thread that makes the founder and the problem inseparable. I want to hear about the hardship that forged the obsession. What I see here is three talented engineers who noticed a gap in developer tooling at their previous employer and are building a product to fill it. That's a perfectly valid reason to start a company, and it might even be a good company. But it doesn't give me that jolt.

To be fair, let me lay out what would have to be true for this to be a great investment, because the bull case isn't nothing. The timing is genuinely interesting — coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor are proliferating fast, and there's a real structural gap between "I built an agent that works on my laptop" and "I have this agent running reliably in production with filesystem access." The specific architectural bet on filesystem-heavy background agents is actually a slightly contrarian call within the broader agent infrastructure space, since most competitors focus on ephemeral sandboxes or raw compute. If filesystem-dependent agents become the dominant pattern — which is plausible given how coding agents actually work — Terminal Use could own a specific, defensible niche. The Palantir alumni network is excellent for enterprise sales, and dogfooding their own platform ("the team uses Terminal Use to ship Terminal Use") is the kind of eat-your-own-cooking credibility I appreciate. If this team executes well and the architectural bet proves right, they could build real switching costs before the larger players figure out this specific pattern.

But that bull case requires me to ignore too many things that matter to my framework. There's no economic access angle here — this doesn't create opportunity for underserved populations or make invisible systems visible. It's infrastructure for developers building AI agents, which is important work, but it doesn't scratch the itch I have about investing in things that alleviate real suffering or open up economic participation. There's no regulatory moat, no stigmatized category that deters other investors, no complexity barrier that creates defensibility. The dossier itself notes that "container orchestration, filesystem isolation, CLI tooling" are well-understood infrastructure patterns. The differentiation is in the specific opinionated combination, which is replicable by any of the better-funded competitors once they decide to focus on it.

The one dimension where Terminal Use does resonate with me is co-founder alignment. Three people who became close friends at university and then worked together at Palantir — one of the most intense, mission-driven environments in tech — have a relationship that's been genuinely stress-tested. I learned the hard way with HQ Trivia that even perfect timing and a brilliant product can't survive broken co-founder dynamics. These three have the kind of shared history and mutual understanding that weathers crises. That matters. But it's not enough on its own to overcome a consensus market, a crowded competitive landscape, and the absence of everything else I look for in a company I'd write a personal check into.
