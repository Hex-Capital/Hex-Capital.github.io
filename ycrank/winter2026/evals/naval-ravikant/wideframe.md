# Wideframe -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Daniel Pearson spent a decade running Bamboo, a growth marketing agency that managed over a billion dollars in paid media for 175+ brands -- Uber, DoorDash, Adobe, Headspace. That's not a resume line. That's ten years of watching video creative teams drown in the workflow around the edit: briefing, searching footage, organizing assets, collecting feedback, producing rough cuts. He didn't study this workflow from the outside. He paid the bills generated by its inefficiency across hundreds of client engagements. When he says 75% of video production time happens outside the NLE, he's not citing a McKinsey report -- he's reporting from the trenches. Then he shut Bamboo down rather than selling it at a discount or running it into the ground. That's a founder who burned a real business to pursue a conviction. The specific knowledge here is operational rather than scientific -- it's pattern recognition across many agency workflows, not a novel insight into video compression or neural architecture. But it's genuine, hard-earned, and not replicable by a smart generalist in six months.

The team structure passes the technologist filter cleanly. Zachary Kim has nearly twenty years of engineering, was CTO at Zaarly (where he and Pearson first worked together), co-founded Float (YC S21), and maintains real open-source credibility -- 1.1k stars on ClojureDocs. He's not a hired CTO brought in to execute someone else's vision. He's a builder with a prior YC company and the kind of engineering depth that means the product architecture decisions are being made by someone who's made them before. The prior working relationship at Zaarly removes the "co-founder speed dating" risk that kills many early teams.

Where I get less excited is the leverage architecture. Wideframe saves video editors time -- the testimonial claims two hours per day per editor. That's valuable, but it's incremental leverage: making existing professionals more efficient at existing work. Compare this to Replit, which enables people who couldn't code at all to build software, or AngelList, which let founders raise capital from people who couldn't previously invest. Those create new categories of capability. Wideframe makes an existing category faster. It's a productivity tool, not a leverage multiplier. The SaaS economics will be linear -- revenue scales with seats, not with usage or network effects. Each customer's video library index creates switching costs, but those are per-tenant, not cross-customer. There's no network topology here that compounds.

The positioning -- deliberately building *around* Adobe's NLE rather than competing with it -- is strategically intelligent but not deeply contrarian. It exploits an incentive misalignment: Adobe can't easily build a tool that admits most of the work happens outside Premiere Pro, and Descript can't pivot to a pre-NLE workflow without undermining its own editor. That's a real structural insight. But AI for video is a crowded space -- Descript at $55M ARR, OpusClip with $79M raised, Runway at $237M+. The specific wedge is differentiated, but the broader category is hot, well-funded, and consensus. Smart people aren't dismissing this idea; they're funding variants of it at scale.

The bull case: if Pearson's agency network gives Wideframe distribution velocity that pure-tech competitors can't match, and if the workflow integration depth (native .prproj read/write, DaVinci Resolve support) creates enough friction to retain customers while the product compounds features, this could become the picks-and-shovels layer for the video production workflow -- infrastructure that sits between the footage library and the NLE, owning a critical workflow chokepoint. Fifty brands and agencies in 75 days suggests real pull. If those convert to paying customers and the product earns genuine daily usage, the distribution advantage from Pearson's decade of agency relationships could compound. That's the scenario where this works -- distribution advantage plus workflow integration depth outrunning the commoditization of the underlying AI capabilities.

The core concern is that the technology layer -- semantic video search, scene detection, natural-language queries over footage -- is being commoditized by foundation model improvements every quarter. What Wideframe can build today with API calls, a well-funded competitor can replicate tomorrow with better models. The .prproj integration is reverse-engineered against an undocumented format -- fragile rather than durable. The moat has to come from workflow design and distribution, not from technology. That's possible but it means this is ultimately a product and distribution bet, not a technology compounding bet. I've seen those work -- Notion's moat is workflow design more than technology -- but it requires exceptional product taste and relentless iteration. The evidence for that level of product craft isn't yet visible in the dossier.
