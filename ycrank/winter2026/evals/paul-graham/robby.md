# Robby -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I want to know about any startup is how the founders found the problem. With Robby, the answer is clear: they didn't find it, they selected it. Vineet and Feroze started with Importrix, an AI platform for customs brokerage. When tariff policy shifted and killed that idea, they "evaluated multiple industries" before landing on home services. Joe's Bain consulting background in home services PE made the category an obvious analytical choice. This is the pattern I've warned about for twenty years -- smart people sitting in a room (in this case, an HBS classroom) methodically scanning industries for opportunities. The idea was manufactured from market analysis, not discovered through lived experience. Nobody on this team was an HVAC technician who couldn't sleep at night because of how much revenue was being left on the table.

But here's what makes this more interesting than the typical brainstormed-idea company: what they did after selecting the industry. They spent months riding along with technicians. They shadowed every office position. They're pursuing EPA 608 certification -- that's the federal credential for handling refrigerants, and nobody gets that as a marketing stunt. This reminds me of what Tony Xu did at DoorDash, personally delivering food to understand the logistics. DoorDash wasn't organic either -- it was a Stanford class project. But the founders earned their insight through obsessive immersion. The question with Robby is whether the immersion has gone deep enough, fast enough, given the pivot was recent. Months of ride-alongs is real. It's not years of living the problem, but it's not nothing.

The schlep here is genuine and worth acknowledging. Getting blue-collar HVAC technicians to use AI tools while they're crawling through attics is exactly the kind of messy, unglamorous work that makes most software founders look away. It's not as structurally daunting as the banking and regulatory schlep that Stripe tackled, but it's the kind of field-level operational complexity that keeps the Stanford-to-startup pipeline out. You need to understand refrigerant types, equipment manufacturers, seasonal demand patterns, and the psychology of a homeowner who's been told their compressor is dying. Most AI founders would rather build copilots for developers. The fact that Robby chose the hard, dirty version of this problem is a point in their favor -- even if they chose it analytically rather than organically.

Nine named paying customers at pre-seed is a credible traction signal. The testimonial claiming "$40k in new business within an hour" on launch day is the kind of specific number that's hard to fabricate entirely, though "revenue opportunities" (the other testimonial) is softer language than "closed revenue." If HVAC contractors are genuinely closing more business because of this tool, that's real pull. The product seems to be working. But the competitive landscape gives me pause. Netic has raised $43M at a $450M valuation, grew revenue 1,700% in under a year, and is targeting the same vertical. Housecall Pro already shipped "Coach AI" features. ServiceTitan has an $8.5 billion market cap and a post-IPO war chest. Robby's value proposition -- revenue optimization layered on top of existing FSM platforms -- is exactly the kind of feature that incumbents absorb. When Housecall Pro can add an AI upsell coach as a product update, the standalone company faces an existential question.

The strongest bull case: this team is technically capable (two of three founders have real engineering backgrounds from Uber, Affinity, Ironclad, Amazon), they've demonstrated adaptability by pivoting successfully rather than clinging to a dead idea, and they have a prior co-founding relationship (Feroze and Joe built Lifelong Health together). If the data loop from technician visits compounds into a genuinely proprietary intelligence layer -- knowing the equipment history, the customer's purchase patterns, the neighborhood's housing stock -- that could become defensible in a way the AI features bolted onto ServiceTitan never will. The narrow vertical focus (HVAC first, not all home services) is the right instinct: keep the fire contained before expanding. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that the depth of field-level data creates a moat that no CRM plugin can replicate, and that Netic's autonomous approach (handling calls and texts remotely) loses to Robby's in-person technician enablement. That's possible. It's just not where my conviction lands.

The team is smart. The execution is disciplined. But the origin story triggers my deepest concern: when founders select a problem through industry analysis rather than stumbling into it through their own frustration, the motivation tends to be brittle. The hardest years in a startup aren't the ones where you're riding in trucks and things are exciting. They're the ones where growth stalls, a competitor raises $50M, and you have to decide whether to keep grinding on HVAC upsell optimization or pivot again. Founders who are working on their own problem -- who would build this product even if no one was paying them -- survive those years. Founders who analytically selected the best market opportunity sometimes don't.
