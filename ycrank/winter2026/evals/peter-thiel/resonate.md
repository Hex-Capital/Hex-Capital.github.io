# Resonate -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is: what is the secret? What important truth does this founder see that most intelligent people actively reject? With Resonate, I cannot identify one. The thesis -- that voice messages should be processed by AI rather than left as raw audio -- is not a secret. It is a consensus opinion shared by every product manager at every major messaging platform on earth. WhatsApp shipped voice message transcription in late 2024. Apple Intelligence is expanding on-device AI processing. Google, Meta, and Apple all have superior speech models, billions of users, and every incentive to integrate these exact features. When a startup's thesis is indistinguishable from the product roadmap of four incumbents, there is no secret -- there is only competition. And I have said many times what I think about competition.

The competitive structure here is the most damning signal. Consumer messaging is perhaps the strongest network-effect category in all of technology. WhatsApp has over two billion users. iMessage owns the social graph of every iPhone owner in America. These are not markets you enter by building a slightly better feature set -- they are natural monopolies sustained by the fact that your friends are already there. Resonate's strategy of importing messages from WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram acknowledges this problem without solving it. You cannot build a messaging monopoly by being parasitic on someone else's network. The dossier notes that the YC page emphasizes "a desperate need for virality and growth" -- this is not the language of definite optimism. It is the language of a company that knows it has a distribution problem and hopes something will work. Hope is not a strategy. Lean methodology repackaged as consumer growth hacking is still indefinite thinking.

The technology layer compounds my concern. Every capability Resonate offers -- transcription, filler removal, emotion detection, text-to-video -- is assembled from commodity APIs. OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, and their equivalents are available to anyone with a credit card. The dossier is explicit: "replication by a funded competitor or incumbent is technically feasible." There is no proprietary technology here that creates a 10x advantage. A better integration and UX design is a 2x improvement at most -- the kind of incremental edge that invites competition rather than foreclosing it. When I backed Palantir, the anti-fraud algorithms from PayPal had been battle-tested on millions of transactions and represented genuinely proprietary intelligence that no competitor could replicate. Resonate has no analogous technological asset. It is assembling publicly available components into a consumer product, which is precisely the kind of "1 to n" work I avoid.

The multi-product strategy at pre-seed -- Resonate Chat, Resonate Create, and "many more in the works" -- is a particularly clear signal of indefinite thinking. A founder with genuine conviction about a specific future would be building one product with total focus, not hedging across multiple bets. The possible pivot from "ChitChat" to "Resonate" reinforces this pattern. This is the iterate-and-discover approach that I have criticized in *Zero to One* -- the belief that if you try enough things, something will stick. Contrast this with Zuckerberg at 19, who had one product, one vision, and refused a billion-dollar exit because he knew exactly what the future of social networking looked like. I see no evidence that Sam Kaplan has that kind of singular, definite vision for the future of communication.

To be fair, the strongest bull case would require believing three things: first, that the voice messaging behavior shift (49% growth since 2020, 61% adoption) represents a secular change in how humans communicate -- a shift from text-first to voice-first that is as fundamental as the shift from email to messaging. Second, that incumbents are structurally unable to innovate their core messaging products fast enough, creating a window for a native challenger. Third, that the integration of emotion detection, coaching, and content creation around voice messages creates genuine user love and switching costs that transcend the network-effect moat of existing platforms. If all three were true, Resonate could potentially become the messaging platform for a generation that communicates primarily through voice. But this requires three simultaneous beliefs, each of which is individually questionable. Incumbents have already started adding these features. Users have never switched messaging platforms for features -- they switch for networks. And emotion detection from voice tone is an interesting parlor trick, not a transformative capability. The bull case is a castle built on sand.

Sam Kaplan has a solid technical background -- Harvard CS, engineering management at Brex during its high-growth phase, Facebook internship -- but this is the profile of a competent engineer, not a founder with the kind of extreme conviction and intellectual depth I look for. No public articulation of a worldview about communication. No Twitter presence. No evidence of the "mild Aspergers" quality -- the social unconventionality and resistance to consensus pressure -- that characterizes the founders I back at the earliest stages. This is a pass.
