# Oximy -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Oximy is that it's in one of the hottest categories in enterprise software right now. AI governance, AI security, shadow AI -- every CISO is talking about it, every VC wants to fund it. Noma Security has raised $132M. Harmonic Security has $26M. Grip Security has $66M. Prompt Security was acquired by SentinelOne. When I see a pre-seed company entering a category where competitors have already raised a combined $250M+, I don't think "big market." I think "consensus idea." The most impressive companies I've seen recently are not working on AI. When everyone agrees a category is important, the upside has already been priced in, and what you're left with is a race to build features -- which favors the team with more money and more people, not the team with the most insight.

The question I always ask first is: how did the founder find this problem? With Oximy, the answer seems to be that Naman Ambavi worked at Induced AI, an AI startup backed by Sam Altman, and from that vantage point observed the broader enterprise AI adoption wave. That's not the worst origin story -- he was adjacent to the ecosystem. But it's not organic in the way that matters most. He wasn't a CISO discovering that his employees were leaking confidential data into ChatGPT. He wasn't a CFO getting blindsided by $200K in shadow AI subscriptions. He was a builder of AI tools who noticed that enterprises needed help governing them. That's market observation, not lived pain. The difference matters because when the hard months come -- and in enterprise sales, there are many hard months -- founders who felt the problem in their bones push through in ways that founders who spotted a market gap do not.

The schlep factor here is also thinner than it first appears. Yes, enterprise sales is a schlep. SOC 2 certification is a schlep. But the core technical challenge -- deploying a desktop agent, monitoring browser activity, classifying AI tools -- is standard endpoint engineering. Compare this to what the Collison brothers walked into with Stripe: banking regulations, money transmission licenses, fraud detection, PCI compliance, integration with legacy financial infrastructure across dozens of countries. That's institutional schlep that kept thousands of smart engineers away for a decade. Oximy's schlep is closer to "build a good product in a competitive market," which is every startup's challenge, not a structural barrier that protects you from competition. CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, and browser security vendors like Island already have agents deployed on enterprise endpoints. Adding AI usage classification to an existing agent is an afternoon's project for those teams. The 3,500-tool detection library is a near-term lead, not a moat.

Now, the bull case. If shadow AI governance turns out to be a category that needs a dedicated "system of record" rather than a feature bolted onto existing security platforms, Oximy is positioned well. The category-straddling argument is interesting -- sitting at the intersection of SaaS management, AI security, and compliance means incumbents from any one domain would need to expand into the other two. Naman has real technical chops: Google Code-In finalist, CodeJam runner-up, and he's clearly a builder -- he shipped Easocare to real revenue with compliance certifications, and he built at Induced AI with LLMs and RAG systems. If the regulatory pressure from the EU AI Act creates urgent, auditable compliance requirements that existing tools can't satisfy, a purpose-built governance platform could win despite being undercapitalized. And Prompt Security's acquisition by SentinelOne at least validates that big security companies want this capability enough to buy it. The timing argument -- regulatory mandates plus explosive AI adoption -- is genuinely strong.

But the structural problems accumulate. Naman is a solo founder. I've said that cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. Enterprise sales requires someone closing deals while someone else builds product while someone else handles compliance and procurement. A five-person team with a solo founder trying to compete against 50-100 person companies with $130M in the bank is asking for something close to a miracle. And Naman's prior venture, Easocare, reached $223K in revenue with a $669K valuation -- respectable for a learning experience, but not the kind of outcome that signals the founder-market fit needed here. The jump from Indian healthtech SaaS to enterprise AI governance in the US is a significant domain transition. I don't see evidence that users are pulling this product toward them -- no revenue figures, no user testimonials, no organic growth signals. There's a $49/month Lens product and a Capterra listing, but nothing that tells me enterprises are saying "we need this and we need it now."

This is a technically capable founder building a reasonable product in a consensus category. That combination raises money but usually doesn't win. The problem wasn't discovered through genuine pain, the schlep doesn't structurally deter well-funded competitors, and there's no evidence yet of the kind of intense user pull that would override those concerns. I'd want to see Naman with a co-founder who spent years inside enterprise security, real customer deployments with economic dependency on the product, and some indication that Oximy has found an angle that $250M in competitor funding hasn't already explored.
