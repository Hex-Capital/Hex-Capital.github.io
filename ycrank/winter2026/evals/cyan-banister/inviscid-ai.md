# Inviscid AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me about Inviscid AI isn't the technology or the market -- it's the competitive landscape, because it tells me everything about where this sits on my consensus-versus-conviction spectrum. PassiveLogic has raised $125 million and already uses physics-based digital twins for buildings. PhysicsX has raised roughly $170 million applying physics-informed AI to engineering simulation. Trane Technologies -- one of the largest HVAC companies on earth -- acquired BrainBox AI in December 2024. NVIDIA's venture arm has invested in multiple companies in this exact category. When I look at this picture, I don't see the anti-consensus opportunity I gravitate toward. I see a space where the consensus has already formed, the capital has already arrived, and a two-person pre-seed team is entering a fight against companies with hundreds of millions in funding and thousands of deployments. The most promising companies I back are not popular. This category is very popular.

Here's the thing about the founders that gives me pause in the way I evaluate people. If I sat down with Kabir and Ziming and asked my usual opening question -- tell me your story, not the business -- I'm not sure what biographical thread would connect them to buildings and airflow and HVAC systems. Kabir is 19 years old, a gold medalist in the International Olympiad in AI, which is genuinely impressive and shows real intellectual horsepower. Ziming is a fifth-year PhD student at NYU working on computer vision and medical image segmentation. These are talented technical minds. But when I look at the case studies on their website -- HVAC vent optimization, coastal infrastructure stress, storm surge forecasting -- I see a general-purpose physics simulation engine being pointed at buildings as a go-to-market, not a founder who woke up haunted by the waste and inefficiency of how we cool commercial spaces. The dispersion across unrelated domains is the tell. When someone is solving a problem rooted in their lived experience, they don't also have coastal infrastructure case studies on the side. That pattern -- technology looking for a market rather than a person compelled to solve a specific problem -- is almost always a signal that the founder will pivot when enterprise sales get hard, because the problem isn't in their bones.

The bull case is real and I want to be honest about it. Physics-informed neural networks are a genuinely differentiated technical approach compared to the data-driven methods that BrainBox AI and 75F use. If you can simulate airflow conditions a building has never encountered before -- rather than just pattern-matching against historical sensor data -- that's a meaningful capability gap, especially for data centers where cooling configurations change constantly with new GPU deployments. The data center cooling market is expanding explosively because of AI workloads, and there's a scenario where a small, technically excellent team finds a high-value niche there before the incumbents adapt. Kabir's IOAI gold medal at 19 is the kind of raw cognitive talent that occasionally produces extraordinary outcomes. If they had a third co-founder who'd spent a decade running building operations at a major REIT or data center operator -- someone who understood BACnet protocols and the politics of facilities management from the inside -- this would be a meaningfully different conversation. That domain expertise gap is the difference between a technically interesting project and a company that can actually close enterprise deals.

What I keep coming back to is that nothing about this company activates my framework. There's no biographical grit story I can anchor to. There's no anti-consensus weirdness -- this is a well-funded category with NVIDIA validation and major acquisitions. There's no economic access angle for underserved populations; optimizing HVAC for commercial real estate portfolios and data centers is valuable but it doesn't create income or transparency for people who lack it. The co-founder relationship is opaque -- no shared institution, no documented history of working through hard things together, no evidence of how they'd weather the kind of crisis that breaks companies. I've learned from HQ Trivia and GameCrush that when I can't see the co-founder dynamics clearly, I need to be cautious. This is a competent team with a real technical approach in a real market, but it doesn't have the biographical magnetism, the non-consensus positioning, or the human impact that pulls me in. I'd wish them well and pass.
