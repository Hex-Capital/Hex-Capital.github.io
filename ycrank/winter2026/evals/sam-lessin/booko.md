# Booko -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Dynamic pricing for perishable inventory is one of the most thoroughly solved problems in business. American Airlines built the first yield management system in 1985. Every hotel chain, car rental company, and concert venue on the planet does this. ClassPass already proved the model works for fitness classes and got acquired by Mindbody for the privilege. So when I look at Booko and ask my foundational question -- is this a sane person with an insane idea? -- the answer is immediate: this is a sane idea. Maybe the sanest idea I've seen in a YC batch. And that's the problem. When an idea is this legible, this well-understood, this "obviously good," the returns have already been priced in by the market. Nobody hears "dynamic pricing for salon time slots" and thinks you're crazy. They think "huh, surprised nobody's done that yet" -- and the reason nobody's built a massive standalone business around it is structural, not accidental.

The structural issue is that Booko is a textbook example of a feature masquerading as a company. It's an ML pricing layer that sits on top of Mindbody, Vagaro, and Acuity via their APIs. Every piece of value it creates -- demand prediction, discount optimization, slot-fill rates -- lives inside someone else's infrastructure. The booking platforms own the customer relationship, the transaction data, and the integration surface. Mindbody already does dynamic pricing through ClassPass with a 20% commission. Yes, there's a channel conflict argument: Mindbody can't easily offer B2B-side pricing tools without cannibalizing ClassPass revenue. That's real. But it's a temporary window, not a moat. Vagaro just acquired Schedulicity in January 2025, signaling they're consolidating features. Any of these incumbents could hire two ML engineers and ship a "smart pricing" toggle inside their existing dashboard. When I apply my core test -- does this business get stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper? -- the answer is unambiguous. AI makes it trivially easy for any scheduling platform to add dynamic pricing as a native feature. The moat dissolves, it doesn't deepen.

The founders deserve a fair assessment. Arjun Saluja worked on dynamic pricing systems at Joby Aviation, which is directly relevant domain experience. Will Hall ran a digital marketing agency, giving him the B2B sales instinct. They met through Dartmouth's Investment & Philanthropy Program, so there's relational depth beyond a startup weekend speed-date. But they're early-career, and the company they're building requires enterprise sales to multi-location service businesses -- franchise owners, operations managers at med spa chains. Nothing in the public record suggests either founder has navigated that kind of sales cycle before. More fundamentally, the founder-idea pairing doesn't produce the non-consensus signal I need. A competent young team applying well-known yield management principles to an underserved vertical is a fine small business thesis. It's not the kind of bet where I'm getting paid for seeing something the market hasn't priced.

To steelman this: if Booko can move fast enough across enough verticals and accumulate cross-business demand intelligence -- knowing that Tuesday 3pm med spa slots in Austin fill at 35% across all providers -- that data flywheel could theoretically create real lock-in. And the Mindbody channel conflict is genuinely interesting -- their marketplace model structurally prevents them from offering the B2B pricing tool that studios actually want. If Booko could become the pricing intelligence layer underneath every independent service business, that starts to look more like infrastructure than a feature. For that to work, you'd need the founders to resist SaaS gravity and instead build something closer to a pricing protocol -- a standard that booking platforms integrate because they can't replicate the cross-platform demand intelligence. That's the infinity story, and it's not impossible. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders are thinking at that structural level. The website talks about "15-25% uplift within 2 weeks" -- that's feature-sale language, not protocol-layer ambition.

This is precisely the category of company I've been publicly arguing against for two years. Software is a business tool, not a business model. Booko's entire value proposition is software intelligence applied to someone else's operations, with no physical-world component, no regulatory position, no protocol lock-in. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is actual painting crews showing up at actual houses -- AI optimizes dispatch and scheduling, but you can't commoditize the labor. Booko has no equivalent. It's a tech company with no paint layer, and I'd rather fund the painting company every time.
