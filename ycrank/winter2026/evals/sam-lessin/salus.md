# Salus -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The most striking thing about Salus is not the founders or the product -- it's the competitive landscape. Galileo has $68 million. Fiddler has $100 million. NVIDIA ships an open-source guardrails library with 5,600 GitHub stars. Gartner has already named a formal category -- "guardian agents" -- and projected it will capture 15% of the AI market within four years. When Gartner has taxonomized your category before you've shipped pricing, you are not building something insane. You are building something obvious. And obvious is the most dangerous place to be in my framework, because obvious means every incumbent with distribution is already thinking about it. OpenAI's own Agents SDK documentation already includes a guardrails section. That's not a competitive signal you overcome with a decorator pattern and a Stanford pedigree.

My sane-person-insane-idea filter yields a mismatch here. The "sane" half is partially present -- Vedant Singh has genuine LLM research depth across multiple Stanford labs, a linguistics olympiad medal, and hands-on multi-agent systems experience with CryptoAgents. That's real. Kevin Pan's documented background is thinner -- Stanford CS enrollment without visible prior work or shipping history. But even granting both founders full technical credibility, the idea itself is the problem. Runtime validation for AI agent tool calls is not a contrarian bet anyone has to defend at a dinner party. It's the kind of thing every enterprise AI buyer is already asking for. The pitch deck leads with TAM, the market is hot, and there are multiple well-capitalized competitors doing overlapping work. This is the exact pattern I filter out: the founder might be brilliant, the demo might be impressive, but the structural logic points toward commoditization.

Apply my AI kill test and you get a paradox that should concern any structural thinker: Salus's entire existence depends on AI agents proliferating, but its product is pure software middleware with no physical operations, no proprietary data moat, and no regulatory position. If AI didn't exist, Salus wouldn't exist -- that's the opposite of the "cherry on top" framework I look for. The dossier itself concedes the core concept is "architecturally straightforward" and that "no structural barrier identified at this stage prevents these vendors from adding runtime blocking as a feature extension." The switching cost argument -- embedded decorators throughout a codebase -- is real but thin. Developers refactor constantly, and if LangChain or OpenAI ships native guardrails that eliminate the need for a third-party wrapper, the decorator pattern becomes technical debt, not lock-in.

The strongest bull case is the Cloudflare analogy: what if pre-execution validation becomes a standard middleware layer, and Salus accumulates enough policy templates and failure-mode data across customer deployments to build a genuine data advantage? The 58% blocked-action recovery rate and the benchmark results on ODCV-Bench suggest real technical sophistication, not vaporware. If agent architectures standardize and the validation layer becomes infrastructure that other tools integrate with, Salus could theoretically graduate from application to primitive. And the timing is genuinely good -- agents are multiplying faster than safety tooling. For this to work, though, Salus would need to achieve category-defining adoption before the framework vendors absorb the functionality, and they'd need to do it as two undergraduates competing against teams with $68-100 million in the bank and enterprise sales organizations. I've seen young founders do extraordinary things, but the race condition here is brutal.

The protocol-layer test seals it for me. Salus is building an application on top of other people's platforms -- LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI, Anthropic SDKs. It depends on those platforms' tool-call interfaces remaining stable and those platforms choosing not to build native guardrails. That's not infrastructure other companies build on; it's middleware that other companies can route around. Compare this to Aleo building zero-knowledge privacy as a cryptographic primitive, or Helium building decentralized wireless as a new connectivity layer. Those investments create new foundational capabilities that don't exist without them. Salus validates tool calls -- a function, not a foundation. The narrative ceiling is theoretically elastic ("firewall for all AI agents everywhere"), but the structural fragility underneath that narrative means the ceiling could collapse the moment a framework vendor ships a competing feature in their next release.
