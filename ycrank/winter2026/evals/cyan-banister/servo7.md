# Servo7 -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately about Servo7: this is one of the most popular categories in all of venture capital right now. Figure AI has raised over $2.6 billion. Agility has $400 million. Apptronik has Google's checkbook behind it. Every fund in Silicon Valley is trying to get a piece of the humanoid robotics wave. And that popularity is, for me, the loudest signal in the room -- and not a good one. The most promising companies I've invested in were ones that other people dismissed as insane. Nobody dismissed warehouse robotics as insane in 2025. Everybody wants in. When I backed SpaceX, people thought Elon had lost his mind. When I backed Crusoe, people couldn't understand why you'd mine Bitcoin on gas flares. That confusion, that head-tilting quality -- that's the signal I trust. I don't feel it here. Servo7 is building something the entire market already agrees is important, which means whatever advantage they have will be competed away on capital, and they have $500K against competitors with a thousand times that.

Now, before I go further -- I always want to hear the founder's story first. Not the business, not the tech stack, not the TAM. Tell me how you got here. And with Pieter and Jasper, what I see are two sharp engineers from TU Delft who've done genuinely impressive technical work -- military drone software, autonomous defense systems, hyperloop engineering. That's real deployment experience in environments where failure has consequences, and I respect it deeply. But I can't find the biographical thread that ties them to *this specific problem* of warehouse automation. I don't see the founder who worked the night shift at a fulfillment center and thought "there has to be a better way." I don't see the person who watched a family business bleed money on manual packing lines. The technical expertise is evident; the personal stake -- the kind that keeps a founder going when the company is in existential crisis at 2 AM -- that's what I can't assess from what's available. When I backed Travis at Uber, it wasn't because he had a great business plan. It was because I could feel the intensity of someone who had been thinking about the taxi medallion system for years and was personally offended by it. That's what I look for, and I don't see it surfacing here.

Where Servo7 actually gets interesting for my framework is in the complexity dimension. Both founders have deployed autonomous systems in military and hospital settings -- regulated, safety-critical environments where a software bug doesn't just crash an app, it creates real physical danger. That experience is genuinely rare and translates directly to industrial robotics, where you're putting machines next to human workers. Most AI robotics teams I see are coming out of pure research labs. These two have shipped autonomy into the field, into places where compliance and safety matter. If I were evaluating purely on "can this team navigate hard operational environments," I'd be leaning forward. Their choice to build wheeled platforms rather than chasing the flashy bipedal humanoid trend also shows a certain practical-mindedness that I appreciate -- it suggests they're thinking about what actually works in a warehouse, not what looks impressive in a demo video.

Let me steelman the bull case, because it's real: if the "learn from demonstrations in one day" claim holds up in production environments, that's a genuine differentiation. Traditional Fanuc integrations take months and cost more than many mid-size operations can afford. If Servo7 can deliver automation to the warehouse operators who've been priced out of the robotics revolution -- the smaller fulfillment centers, the regional CPG brands -- they'd be creating real economic access where it doesn't exist today. That's a pattern I care about deeply: making an invisible barrier visible and then removing it. And the European base could be an advantage -- less crowded startup ecosystem for industrial robotics, strong manufacturing tradition, and a labor market where automation pressure is acute. If this team can get three or four real deployments generating data before their next raise, the data flywheel story becomes credible. The best version of this company looks like Formic's accessibility model but with genuine AI learning capability layered on top -- and that would be defensible.

But I keep coming back to the structural challenges. They're building on Hugging Face's open-source LeRobot framework, which accelerates development but means other teams have the same starting blocks. Hardware businesses at pre-seed are brutal -- each customer deployment requires physical robots, supply chains, field maintenance, and capital they don't yet have. And the competitive landscape isn't just well-funded, it's well-funded by the companies that *are* the customers: Amazon acquired Covariant, Google is backing Apptronik. When your potential buyers are funding your competitors, that's a market structure problem that clever engineering alone doesn't solve. I don't see the defensibility moat that would let a $500K company survive in a market where incumbents are spending billions. Without a biographical anchor that tells me these founders will claw through walls for this specific problem, and without the kind of non-consensus weirdness that protects a company from competition, this feels like a well-executed entry into a market that's going to be very expensive to compete in. I'd want to meet them, hear their personal stories firsthand, and understand what's driving them beyond the technical challenge -- but based on what's in front of me, this isn't the kind of bet I write first checks into.
