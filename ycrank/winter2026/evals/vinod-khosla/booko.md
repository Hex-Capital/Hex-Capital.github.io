# Booko -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is the company I use as a cautionary example when I talk to ambitious young founders about calibrating the scale of their ambition to the scale of the problem. Booko has taken every step to reduce its probability of failure -- proven concept (dynamic pricing has worked in airlines for forty years), modest and measurable claims ("15-25% revenue uplift"), dependence on existing platforms rather than replacing them -- and in doing so has shrunk the consequence of success to something that barely registers. If Booko succeeds beyond anyone's wildest expectations, hair salons and med spas charge slightly different prices on Tuesday afternoons. The world operates exactly the same way it did before, except some small business owners collect marginally more revenue on their empty 2pm slots. That is not a consequence of success I can get excited about.

The structural positioning tells me everything about the ambition here. Booko builds on top of Mindbody, Vagaro, and Acuity via their APIs. It depends on incumbents for its existence. I fund companies that make incumbents obsolete -- Juniper made Cisco's legacy architecture irrelevant, Square made traditional POS infrastructure unnecessary. Booko does the opposite: it needs the incumbents to survive, to keep their APIs open, to not build the same feature themselves. The dossier notes that Mindbody already runs dynamic pricing through ClassPass. Vagaro just acquired Schedulicity in January 2025. These platforms have the customer relationships, the booking data, and the engineering resources to add a pricing optimization layer whenever they choose. Building a feature that sits on top of platforms who can replicate it as a checkbox is not a company -- it's a demonstration project.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. The perishable inventory problem is real -- an empty salon chair at 3pm is gone forever, and that's a genuine economic inefficiency worth solving. The ClassPass channel conflict is structurally interesting: Mindbody earns 20% commissions on its marketplace transactions, which means building B2B-side dynamic pricing tools would cannibalize its own revenue stream. That creates a window where an independent player could operate. If Booko accumulated enough cross-business utilization data, the ML models could develop genuine predictive power that new entrants can't replicate -- a data flywheel. And Arjun Saluja's work on dynamic pricing at Joby Aviation suggests at least one founder has touched this problem in a different context. In the best scenario, Booko becomes the yield-management intelligence layer for the entire service economy, processing millions of time-slot decisions daily and extracting value from each. That's a real business. But it's a SaaS business doing optimization, not a company that transforms how any industry fundamentally operates.

The technology here is well-understood demand forecasting applied to a new vertical. There is no breakthrough required and none claimed. ML-based price prediction for perishable inventory is a solved problem at airlines, hotels, and ride-sharing platforms. Deploying it for fitness studios is an implementation exercise, not a technology frontier. The dossier itself acknowledges the commoditization risk: "the core concept of demand-based pricing for time slots is not proprietary." When the technology risk approaches zero, I lose interest -- because it means anyone can build it, and the defensibility conversation becomes about sales execution and integration partnerships, not about something structurally difficult to replicate. I don't invest in companies whose moat is "we got there first" in a market where getting there requires no invention.

Both founders are early-career Dartmouth graduates. I have nothing against young founders -- I backed Peter Beck when the aerospace establishment laughed at a guy from New Zealand. But Beck was attempting something the experts said was physically impossible. These founders are attempting something everyone agrees is sensible and obvious. There is no contrarian courage on display, no signal that the consensus dismisses their approach. When I assess founders, I look for the willingness to be wrong about something important -- to stake their careers on a thesis that makes industry veterans uncomfortable. Dynamic pricing for salons makes nobody uncomfortable. It's the kind of idea a business school case study would validate on page one. These are clearly smart people who should be working on a problem whose consequence of success matches their capability.
