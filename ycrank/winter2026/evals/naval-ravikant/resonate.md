# Resonate -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

I should disclose upfront: I co-founded Airchat, which operates in the voice-first communication space. Resonate is private messaging where Airchat is public social, but there's obvious adjacency. I'll evaluate on the merits, and readers can discount for the conflict. That said, having built in this space gives me a sharper lens on what's actually hard here -- and what isn't.

The first question I always ask: what does this founder know that a smart generalist couldn't learn in six months? Sam Kaplan is a competent engineer -- Harvard CS, scaled engineering at Brex from 80 to 1,000 people, shipped AI side projects. That's a solid resume. But it's a resume, not specific knowledge. Nothing in his background suggests years of obsessive thinking about how humans communicate through voice, or why the audio waveform contains structured information that current messaging platforms waste. He built GPTTok and ChatSF -- general-purpose AI experiments, not voice communication systems. Lily Zhao brings business development and prompt engineering experience, which is useful but interchangeable. The prior product name (ChitChat) and the pivot suggest they're iterating toward a problem, not executing from deep conviction about one they've lived inside. When I backed Evan Williams, he'd spent a decade on the evolution of public expression. When I invested in Amjad Masad at Replit, he'd been building coding environments since he was a teenager in Jordan. I don't see that depth of founder-problem entanglement here.

The leverage test exposes a structural weakness. Resonate processes individual voice messages through commodity AI pipelines -- transcription, filler removal, emotion detection. Each message is an independent unit of compute. There's no protocol being created, no network that gets smarter with each participant, no platform on which others build. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question-and-answer pair made the knowledge graph more valuable for every subsequent developer. Or to AngelList, where each new investor on the platform increased deal flow for every founder. Resonate is an application wrapper around APIs that OpenAI, Google, and Apple are commoditizing in real time. The cross-platform import feature is clever distribution engineering, but it means the network effects live on WhatsApp and Telegram, not on Resonate. You're a feature layer on top of someone else's graph.

The timing isn't contrarian -- it's consensus arriving late. "Voice messages should be transcribed and searchable" is a PowerPoint slide that exists on every product manager's desk at Meta, Apple, and Google. WhatsApp shipped voice transcription in late 2024. Apple Intelligence is expanding on-device processing. The question isn't whether AI-enhanced voice messaging will exist -- it's whether it will exist as a standalone app or as a feature inside platforms with three billion users. The smart consensus answer is: it becomes a feature. Resonate is betting against that, which could be contrarian, but I don't hear the founders articulating a specific theory for why the consensus is wrong. That's the distinction -- a contrarian opinion without specific knowledge backing it is just contrarianism. Uber was contrarian because Travis understood regulatory arbitrage and marketplace dynamics in ways regulators didn't. What's the analogous insight here?

The bull case, if I'm being honest with it: voice is becoming the primary input modality for AI interaction, messaging is still stuck in a text-first paradigm, and the first team to build a truly AI-native communication layer could own a new category. If Resonate nails the UX -- if receiving an AI-processed voice message is qualitatively so much better than a raw audio clip that people share Resonate links virally -- then the cross-platform import strategy becomes a wedge into billions of existing voice messages. The "desperate need for virality" line on their YC page suggests they know this is binary: either the sharing mechanic creates a growth loop or the product stays a niche tool. For this bull case to work, three things would need to be true simultaneously: the AI processing has to feel magical rather than merely useful, the sharing format has to compel recipients to download the app, and incumbents have to remain slow for another 18-24 months. That's a lot of simultaneous requirements, and in my experience, betting on incumbent slowness is a losing strategy when the feature is obvious.

The multi-product signal concerns me most from a long-term orientation standpoint. "Many more products in the works" at pre-seed with what appears to be a two-person team -- Resonate Chat for messaging, Resonate Create for agentic video -- this is the pattern of founders who are passionate about building products, not about solving one specific problem deeply. I look for founders who would work on this problem even if no one funded them, for a decade. The breadth of product ambition at this stage suggests otherwise.
