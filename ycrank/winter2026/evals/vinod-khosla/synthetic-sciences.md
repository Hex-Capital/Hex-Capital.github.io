# Synthetic Sciences -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me about Synthetic Sciences: the competitive landscape tells you everything about the timing problem. Periodic Labs raised $300 million. Edison Scientific raised $70 million. Google announced its own AI Co-Scientist built on Gemini 2.0. Sciloop, a direct competitor automating the exact same ML experimentation pipeline, graduated from YC one batch earlier. When I backed Juniper Networks, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router -- the experts dismissed the entire approach. When I invested in OpenAI, AI was "laughable" and the category had no competition. Here, the category is so validated that hundreds of millions in venture capital have already arrived. These founders aren't skating to where the puck will be -- they're arriving at a rink that's already crowded with players who have 100-200x more capital. The contrarian signal I look for -- experts dismissing the idea, outsiders not yet crowding in -- is entirely absent.

The consequence question is where this falls short for me. If Synthetic Sciences succeeds as framed -- 93 pre-built research skills, five operational modes, $50 to $200 per month -- you've built a popular productivity tool for ML researchers. That's a real business. But nobody's life fundamentally changes. The way science is conducted doesn't become structurally different -- it becomes 30-50% more efficient. Researchers still design studies, still interpret results, still write papers. They just have a better integrated toolkit. Now, the deeper thesis in the YC page -- building RL environments and process-based training data so that the product generates training signal for increasingly autonomous agents -- that's a much more interesting consequence. Truly autonomous AI scientists would transform the rate of human knowledge creation, a consequence worth pursuing at any failure probability. But the product as built and priced is the workflow tool, not the autonomous scientist. The gap between the ambitious thesis and the current product framing is significant, and I see no evidence the founders have a path from one to the other that their much better-capitalized competitors don't also possess.

The founders themselves present a genuine tension in my framework. Aayam Bansal with 15+ papers across ICML, IEEE, and ACL at age 18, research stints at MIT CSAIL, CMU, Harvard, Oxford, and a prior acquisition. Ishaan Gangwani representing India at the International Olympiad in AI, USACO Platinum, research at Berkeley and Cambridge. The learning rate is extraordinary -- the sheer volume and quality of output from two 18-year-olds exceeds many PhD candidates. These are "best athletes" by any definition. But here's what my framework catches that a generic evaluation misses: they're insiders, not outsiders. They're ML researchers building a better tool for ML researchers. That's exactly the pattern I worry about -- people who know the field so well they optimize the existing workflow rather than reimagining it entirely. Pat Brown was a biochemist who didn't know what the food industry considered impossible, which freed him to try to replace it. These founders know exactly what computational researchers consider possible, and they've built precisely that: a well-engineered integration of existing capabilities. The 93 skills and 12 service integrations represent excellent engineering, not a fundamentally new approach to scientific discovery.

The strongest bull case I can construct: two prodigies with exceptional learning rates are building the foundational platform for autonomous AI research. Their data flywheel -- product usage generating RL training signal -- compounds over time into a defensible moat. They're in YC, they have Gustaf Alstromer as their partner, and they've raised $1.4 million at 18 years old. If the underlying LLM capability curve keeps accelerating, and their platform captures the best process data from real research workflows, they could leapfrog from productivity tool to autonomous scientist faster than anyone else because they're closest to the actual users. The age is a feature, not a bug -- forty years of runway to iterate. I've backed founders at the earliest possible moment before, when there was "one person, not even a company." But even in that case -- Impossible Foods -- the ambition was to replace a $1.7 trillion industry, not to make existing researchers more productive. The ambition here, as expressed in the product, is calibrated too modestly for the scale of what these two clearly capable people could attempt.

The brand confusion between Synthetic Sciences and InkVell, the pivot from "research and document productivity" to "AI co-scientists," the five operational modes trying to serve too many use cases -- these signal a company still searching for its core thesis. At pre-seed, that's normal. But combined with the competitive pressure from massively funded players and a direct YC competitor, it suggests the founders haven't yet identified the contrarian insight that would justify betting on a two-person team with $1.4 million against Google and $370 million in competitive capital. I'd tell these two the same thing I tell every brilliant team pursuing a crowded space: you're too talented to fight over the same ground everyone else is contesting. Find the piece of this problem that everyone else considers impossible, and go there.
