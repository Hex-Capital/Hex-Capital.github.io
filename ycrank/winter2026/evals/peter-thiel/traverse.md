# Traverse -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

Thirty-five companies. That is the number of entrants Wing VC has counted in the RL environment space as of 2025. When I see thirty-five startups converging on the same thesis -- that frontier AI labs need third-party training environments -- I see the unmistakable signature of mimetic competition. Everyone is copying everyone else. The market looks "hot," which means every VC blog post and every YC application essay says the same thing: RL environments are the next scaling lever, labs are signing seven-figure contracts, and someone will capture this value. But when every participant in a market can articulate the same thesis, there is no secret. There is only a crowd. Traverse enters this crowd as a two-person pre-seed team competing against Scale AI ($29 billion valuation, $870 million in revenue), Surge AI ($1.2 billion in revenue), and Mechanize -- which is already working with Anthropic and backed by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. The structural dynamics here are worse than a Red Ocean. They are a monopsony: four or five frontier labs hold purchasing power over thirty-five-plus suppliers. That is not a market where a startup builds a monopoly. That is a market where the buyers dictate terms and the sellers destroy each other.

The claimed differentiation -- non-deterministic verification, building verifiers for "taste-dependent" domains where correctness is subjective -- is the closest thing to a secret in this dossier. But I must ask: is this actually contrarian? Every researcher in the field understands that RL works well for math and coding because verifiers are straightforward, and poorly for medicine, law, and creative work because verification is ambiguous. This is not an insight that most smart people reject. It is a problem statement that most smart people accept. The difference matters enormously. A genuine secret would be a specific, non-obvious method for constructing verifiers in subjective domains -- a technique that experts would argue could not work. Instead, what I see is a correct diagnosis of a known problem with no visible proprietary solution. Correct diagnosis without proprietary cure is consulting, not technology.

The pivot from Clice AI -- "personal AI agents for team coordination" -- to Traverse tells me something important about the founders' relationship to their own ideas. The domain clice.ai now redirects to traverse.so, and the YC page for Clice AI displays Traverse's information. This means the entire product direction changed during or immediately before the current YC batch. I have nothing against pivots per se -- PayPal pivoted multiple times before finding its product. But the pattern here looks less like strategic repositioning and more like what I would call indefinite thinking: the founders did not enter YC with a definite vision for how the world should work. They entered with one idea, abandoned it, and adopted a direction that happens to match the current consensus about where AI infrastructure spending is flowing. This is the iterate-and-discover methodology I have criticized for twenty years. A founder with a genuine secret about non-deterministic verification would have been building toward it for years, not arriving at it through a batch-time pivot.

The strongest bull case -- which I take seriously -- runs as follows. If building verifiers for subjective domains genuinely requires fundamentally different expertise from deterministic labeling, then Scale AI and Surge AI's existing operations might be optimized for the wrong problem. Their armies of labelers following rubrics cannot do what a small team with deep domain understanding and ML intuition can do. In this version of the future, Traverse is analogous to early Palantir: everyone knew data analysis mattered for intelligence, but the specific implementation -- adapting PayPal's fraud algorithms for counterterrorism -- was a genuine engineering secret that the NSA's existing infrastructure could not replicate. If Traverse possesses a specific methodology for constructing non-deterministic verifiers that demonstrably improves model performance in ways that Scale AI's approach cannot match, and if that methodology compounds with each deployment, the learning-curve moat could be real. But there is no evidence of this in the dossier. No proprietary method described, no traction demonstrated, no domain even selected. The bull case requires me to assume the existence of a secret that the founders have not yet articulated, which is a bet on potential rather than on visible insight.

Lance Yan and Zachary Yu are technically competent -- Waterloo CS, ML experience, relevant exposure to the AI lab ecosystem through Kalshi and Mercor respectively. Zachary's side projects show genuine builder instincts (25K users in 24 hours on vibeornot.com suggests product intuition). But neither founder has a prior exit, neither has demonstrated the kind of extreme conviction that defines my highest-confidence bets, and the pivot itself is evidence against directional certainty. When Zuckerberg refused a billion-dollar acquisition at twenty-two, that was a signal about the depth of his vision. When a founder abandons their thesis and adopts the market's consensus thesis mid-batch, that is a signal of a different kind. I do not see the intellectual framework -- the deep thinking about why non-deterministic verification matters civilizationally, not just commercially -- that would differentiate these founders from the other thirty-four teams pursuing adjacent strategies.

The market structure seals the verdict. The RL environment space will consolidate to three to five leaders by 2030 according to the most credible analysis available. The survivors will be those with the deepest lab relationships, the largest proprietary datasets, and the most capital to invest in domain expertise. Traverse, with two founders, no revenue, no demonstrated technology, and no visible lab relationships, is entering a consolidation race where the leaders already have billion-dollar head starts. This is not a small market that can be monopolized and then expanded -- it is a large, contested market where the buying power is concentrated in a handful of customers who are simultaneously building the same capabilities in-house. I see competent founders chasing a real market with a consensus thesis and no visible path to monopoly. That is the definition of competition, and competition remains, as ever, for losers.
