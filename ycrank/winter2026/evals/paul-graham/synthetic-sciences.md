# Synthetic Sciences -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Synthetic Sciences is that every well-funded AI lab and their interns are building an AI co-scientist right now. Periodic Labs raised $300 million. Edison Scientific raised $70 million. Google is building one on Gemini. Elicit has $33 million and is already doing $18-22 million in ARR. Sciloop, a YC company from literally one batch earlier, is doing the same thing. When I look at a category where this many smart, well-capitalized teams are all racing toward the same destination, my immediate reaction is: the idea is not the hard part. This is the opposite of schlep blindness. Nobody is unconsciously filtering this opportunity out. Everyone can see it. That means the upside has already been distributed across dozens of competitors, and winning requires not an insight that others lack but sheer execution against teams with 100x more capital. Stripe worked because for a decade, thousands of programmers looked at payment processing and unconsciously turned away from the banks and the fraud and the regulation. Here, everybody is running toward the problem, not away from it.

What complicates this is that the founders do have a genuine organic connection to the work. Both Aayam and Ishaan are real ML researchers — 15+ papers at ICML, IEEE, and ACL for Aayam, IOAI and USACO Platinum for Ishaan, research stints at MIT CSAIL, CMU, Harvard, Berkeley, Cambridge, Oxford. These aren't business school graduates who read a McKinsey report on AI-for-science and decided to start a company. They've personally lived through the research workflow grind of literature review, experiment orchestration, and paper drafting. That's a meaningful signal. But organic problem awareness and organic idea discovery are different things. Everyone who publishes at ICML knows the workflow is painful. The question is whether they built this because they couldn't stop thinking about it, or because they noticed the category was on fire after Google's AI Co-Scientist announcement in February 2025 and the massive rounds being raised around them. The trail of evidence — an earlier incarnation called InkVell focused on "research and document productivity," then an expansion to a full "AI co-scientist" platform right as the category exploded — suggests the idea grew outward to match the market opportunity rather than inward from a specific, burning frustration.

The technical signal from these founders is genuinely strong. At 18, both have competitive credentials that would be notable at any age. Building a platform with 93 research skills and 12 service integrations as a two-person team in roughly eight months is impressive shipping velocity. USACO Platinum and IOAI medal-level performance mean Ishaan can actually code, not just talk about AI. Aayam's prior exit — however small "aisock" was — means he's been through the cycle before. These are clearly people who build things rather than commission them. If I were evaluating just the founders in isolation, I'd be quite interested. The problem is that I'm not evaluating founders in isolation; I'm evaluating these specific founders against this specific competitive landscape, and two 18-year-olds with $1.4 million competing against teams with $70-300 million in adjacent spaces and Google building internally is a hard position regardless of talent.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: these founders are so young that they have a 20-year runway of energy and adaptability. The data flywheel — where product usage generates process data for RL training, making the agents progressively better — could create a real moat if they accumulate enough users before competitors lock in the same feedback loop. The initial product scope (computational research — ML, bioinformatics, materials science) is actually narrower than Edison (biology/chemistry) or Periodic (physical labs), so they could win the specific niche of ML-on-ML research automation. And the credit-based PLG model at $50/month is well-positioned for bottom-up adoption by graduate students and postdocs who won't go through enterprise procurement. If the product is genuinely good and spreads virally through ML Twitter and academic labs, the competitors with $300M in funding and complex organizational structures could be too slow to match the iteration speed of a two-person team that uses the product themselves. For this bull case to work, you'd need to see evidence that actual researchers are using the platform and pulling it into their workflows. And there's none of that evidence here — no user counts, no community, no social presence, no Product Hunt launch, nothing. For a product targeting ML researchers, who are among the most online and vocal communities in tech, the silence is conspicuous.

The brand confusion between InkVell and Synthetic Sciences also nags at me. The legal entity is Inkvell Inc. The LinkedIn page says InkVell. The YC listing says Synthetic Sciences. Earlier press describes a document productivity tool; the current positioning is end-to-end research automation. This feels like founders who are still searching for their exact shape, which at pre-seed is understandable, but combined with the consensus-category dynamics, it suggests they haven't yet found the specific, narrow wedge that would let them win against much larger competitors. The best startups at this stage are deliberately narrow — Facebook at Harvard, Stripe for developers only. Synthetic Sciences has five operational modes, 93 skills, and 12 integrations. That's a lot of surface area for two people, and it raises the question of whether anything is deep enough to create real user dependency.

These are talented, technical young founders who I'd be excited to back on a different problem — one where their specific knowledge led them to a schlep that nobody else wanted to touch. But this particular category is the definition of consensus hot, the competitive moat is unclear against well-capitalized rivals, and there's no evidence yet that users are pulling the product toward them. The founders' youth and energy are real assets, but assets deployed in a crowded market where the biggest players can see exactly the same opportunity.
