# Button Computer -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The AI wearable category is a $240 million graveyard, and Button Computer wants to build a cheaper headstone. Humane raised a quarter billion dollars, shipped a $499 device, and sold its carcass to HP for $116 million fourteen months ago. Limitless got swallowed by Meta. Rabbit R1 is drifting. And now two ex-Apple engineers want to enter this exact category with a clip-on button that captures your voice, routes it to an LLM API, and speaks back. The competitive landscape here isn't just crowded — it's actively consolidating into the hands of platform incumbents who own the distribution. Apple is reportedly building its own AI wearable. OpenAI is working with Jony Ive. Meta acquired Limitless specifically to absorb this functionality. When I say "the winner of the AI race depends on consumer distribution," this is precisely the category I'm describing. Button is an application sitting on top of Apple's Bluetooth stack, Apple's phone, and someone else's language model. That's three layers of platform dependency with zero structural leverage.

The founders are credible but the idea isn't non-consensus — and that's the core problem. Chris Nolet and Ryan Burgoyne both worked on Vision Pro at Apple, which gives them legitimate hardware and spatial computing chops. They've shipped real product at infrastructure scale. That's the "sane" part, and it's genuine. But the idea — a simpler, cheaper AI wearable — is about as consensus as it gets in 2026. Every hardware startup, every big tech company, and multiple open-source projects are converging on voice-first AI interaction. When I look for "sane person, insane idea," I need the idea to provoke genuine skepticism from other investors. Nobody is confused by "what if talking to AI was easier?" — they're all building it. The differentiation here is price ($79-$179 vs. competitors at $89-$499), which is a feature of execution, not a thesis. And the founder attention question nags at me: Nolet founded Vibe Code Go in YC S25 and Button Computer in YC W26 — two different companies in consecutive batches. That pattern looks less like relentless focus and more like the serial-pitch cadence I associate with founders optimizing for the fundraising cycle rather than the building cycle.

This company fails my "cherry on top" test as completely as anything I've evaluated. If AI didn't exist, what is Button Computer? A Bluetooth speaker with a push-to-talk button. There is no business without the AI layer. The AI isn't a cherry on top of an already-good business — the AI IS the entire sundae. And the dossier states it plainly: "The core technology (voice capture → LLM API call → text-to-speech response) is technically reproducible. Bluetooth-connected microphone/speaker hardware is commodity." When the technology stack is commodity and the moat is supposed to be "simplicity and price," you're one AirPods firmware update away from irrelevance. Apple doesn't even need to build a new device — they can push a software update to 300 million installed AirPods that does exactly what Button does, and it'll be better because it's already in your ear.

The bull case, which I want to take seriously, goes something like this: Humane failed because it was overengineered and overpriced. The market learned that consumers want radical simplicity, not a $499 chest projector. Button is the "right" version — cheap, focused, no screen, no camera, just press and talk. Like how the iPod Shuffle captured a huge market by stripping away everything the iPod had, maybe there's a massive market for the simplest possible AI interface at an impulse-buy price point. And the founders' Apple hardware experience means they can actually ship the thing, which is more than most two-person teams can claim. If the category works and Button ships first at scale at the lowest price, volume could create enough user interaction data to build a real flywheel. I'd need to believe three things simultaneously for this to work: (1) standalone AI wearables are a durable category that doesn't get absorbed into existing devices, (2) simplicity and price are defensible moats rather than temporary positioning advantages, and (3) a two-person pre-revenue team can win a hardware manufacturing race against funded competitors and big tech. I can't get there on any of the three, let alone all of them.

There's no primitive being created here. Button isn't establishing a new protocol layer or building infrastructure that other companies integrate with. It's a consumer electronics product that depends entirely on someone else's intelligence layer. Compare this to Venmo, which created a new payment primitive that became infrastructure for how money moves between people. Compare it to Helium, which built a decentralized wireless protocol that other IoT devices use. Button creates nothing that compounds. Every unit sold is a standalone transaction with no network effect. The narrative ceiling is "lots of people buy our button," which is a consumer electronics story, not an infinity story. Consumer electronics companies that don't become platforms get competed down to commodity margins — and Button is starting at commodity.

I'm passing. The structural logic points in exactly the wrong direction for my framework. The AI is the product, not the cherry on top. The moat is price, which isn't a moat. The category is consensus, not contrarian. And the incumbents who own distribution — Apple, Google, Meta — are all converging on this exact use case with devices that are already in hundreds of millions of pockets and ears. I'd genuinely rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company with a paint layer, and Button is the purest expression of the latter category I've seen.
