# Caretta -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Caretta is the archetype of the company I describe when people ask what I pass on. A real-time AI assistant that helps sales reps answer product questions during live calls. The technology works. The market exists. The team is competent. And I stop right there — because the question that matters most is: if Caretta succeeds perfectly, if every sales organization on earth adopts it, what changes? Sales reps fumble fewer objections. Close rates tick up a few percentage points. Onboarding gets marginally faster. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The consequence of full success is a nice SaaS company competing with Gong for enterprise seats. These founders have found a problem that's real enough to sustain a business but small enough that winning it doesn't rearrange anything. They've navigated toward safety — an existing market category, proven demand, off-the-shelf components — and in doing so, made the upside inconsequential.

The technology story reinforces this. Their public GitHub repo is a FastAPI wrapper around NVIDIA's Parakeet transcription model — zero stars, one fork. Real-time transcription plus RAG plus LLM inference is a pattern that any engineering team with access to the same APIs can assemble in weeks. This is not Juniper building TCP/IP routers when Cisco's CTO swore they'd never exist. This is not even a novel technical architecture. Gong, with $584 million in funding and $250 million in ARR, has already begun shipping real-time features. Cresta has $282 million. Balto has $52 million and $22 million in ARR specifically in live-call guidance. Caretta's differentiation — "unstructured knowledge retrieval from organizational documents" versus Balto's scripted talk tracks — is a feature difference, not a structural one. When your moat is "we do the same thing but with a slightly different knowledge retrieval approach," you're one Gong product update away from irrelevance.

I'll give the founders credit for one signal: the pivot velocity. They launched VoysAI in April 2025 with recruitment screening and call practice products, recognized it wasn't working, and reoriented to live-call intelligence within six to eight months. That willingness to abandon a thesis and move is a data point on learning rate. But learning rate in service of what? They pivoted toward the consensus, not away from it. They moved from a less crowded space (AI recruitment screening) to one of the most saturated categories in B2B SaaS (sales enablement). A founder with high learning rate and genuine contrarian courage would be running toward the problem that terrifies them and matters, not optimizing for the market that already has five well-funded competitors.

Here is the genuine bull case I've considered: the shift from post-call analytics to real-time in-call intelligence is an architectural discontinuity, not an incremental feature. Gong's infrastructure was built for recording and analyzing completed calls — pivoting to sub-second latency retrieval during live conversation requires fundamentally different systems. If real-time call intelligence becomes the dominant paradigm, there's a version of history where Caretta's head start in this specific mode matters, where the per-customer knowledge flywheel creates real switching costs, and where being first with a Slack-native workflow captures the SMB/mid-market before Gong's enterprise sales motion reaches down. The timing is genuinely favorable — LLM inference latency only crossed the real-time threshold in the past eighteen months. If I squint, there's a version of this that's a meaningful company. But "meaningful company" is not the threshold I invest against. Even the best-case scenario here is a conversation intelligence tool worth some fraction of Gong's market cap. It doesn't replace how sales works; it makes the existing model slightly more effective. That's the definition of incremental.

The team composition compounds my concern. All three founders share the same background — TU Delft Computer Science, no identified experience in B2B sales, revenue operations, or enterprise GTM. I prize outsiders, but outsiders attacking an industry-transforming problem, not outsiders entering a crowded market they don't understand from the demand side. There's no evidence of deliberate gene pool engineering — no sales leader, no domain expert who's lived the pain of managing a 200-person revenue team. Selling sales AI to sales leaders requires a kind of credibility and workflow intuition that pure CS backgrounds don't naturally provide, and nobody on this team appears to bring it.

I'll be direct: these are smart people applying their talent to a problem that's too small. The world doesn't need another conversation intelligence platform. Find a problem where the consequence of success justifies the years of your life you'll spend on it. Something where, if you succeed, the existing way of doing things becomes structurally uneconomic. That's the kind of bet I write checks for.
