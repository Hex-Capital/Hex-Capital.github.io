# SideKit -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The pricing structure here tells me everything about where this company sits in its market. The most defensible feature -- version gating, which blocks broken app releases and forces minimum versions -- is given away for free on every tier. Revenue depends on analytics signals, which is the most commoditized capability in the bundle. When a startup inverts the value-price relationship like this, giving away the thing that creates switching costs while charging for the thing that's easiest to replicate, it signals a market positioning problem that runs deeper than pricing strategy. Firebase Remote Config gives away feature flags and remote configuration as part of a free platform that already includes auth, databases, cloud functions, and hosting. SideKit is charging $42/month for analytics signals that compete with a free component of the most widely adopted mobile development platform on earth.

The structural moment question is where this falls apart for me. What has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes bundled mobile developer tooling possible now when it wasn't before? The dossier's "why now" reasons are all marked [Inferred] -- the researchers couldn't find the founders or any external source articulating a specific inflection point. The feature management market is growing at 8.6% CAGR. That's steady. It's not inflecting. Mobile analytics has been a mature category for a decade. SDK bloat is a real pain point, but it was equally real in 2020. The vibe coding argument -- that AI tools are creating new mobile developers who need simpler production infrastructure -- is the most interesting angle, but it's speculative, and those new developers are more likely to reach for Firebase's free, well-documented, Google-backed ecosystem than for a pre-seed SDK with 7 GitHub stars. This is a consensus market with well-funded incumbents and no structural change creating a new opening.

The bull case is worth engaging with honestly. Ashish Selvaraj built Not Evil Sudoku to 50,000+ installs, then built a private analytics service for it, then wrote about why existing tools failed him -- and that exact pain point became SideKit. That's a genuine founder-market fit origin story, the kind where the product emerges from a real problem rather than a market analysis slide. If the explosion of AI-assisted app builders creates a meaningful new cohort of developers who ship mobile apps without wanting to learn Firebase's ecosystem, a dead-simple single-SDK solution could capture that cohort at the moment of first need. The Gusto analogy would be: payroll isn't exciting, but every employer needs it. Similarly, every app needs version management and analytics. If SideKit becomes the default "production toolkit" for the next generation of indie mobile developers, the $42/month Growth tier multiplied across hundreds of thousands of developers starts to look like real revenue. But this bull case requires Firebase to remain perceived as too complex or too Google-dependent -- and Google has every incentive to make Firebase simpler for exactly this new developer cohort.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is structurally limited at the current price points and feature scope. Stripe's payments API worked as a distribution channel because every developer who integrated it was locked in through transaction flow -- the integration was load-bearing infrastructure. SideKit's analytics SDK can be swapped out with a few lines of code. The version gating feature is stickier, but it's free, which means it doesn't generate revenue even as it creates modest retention. For this company to follow a product-to-distribution path, it would need to expand into adjacent production infrastructure -- crash reporting, performance monitoring, push notifications, CI/CD integration -- and become the production layer for indie mobile development. The founders haven't articulated this vision publicly, and the current product (three features in a lightweight SDK) doesn't yet suggest platform ambitions.

The execution evidence is mixed. Ashish has shipped a real product to real users and written thoughtfully about the analytics problem. Ethan brings competitive programming and cross-platform SDK skills. But 11 commits and 7 GitHub stars on the iOS SDK, with 2 releases over what appears to be a few months, suggests the product is extremely early. The feature set -- analytics signals, version gating, in-app messaging -- is narrow relative to what incumbents offer. At a $42/month ceiling, customer acquisition costs need to be near zero, which means the distribution strategy has to be organic developer adoption. The dossier shows no evidence of a concrete distribution plan beyond open-source SDK availability, which is exactly the pattern I flag as "assumes the product sells itself." Every indie developer tool that's broken out -- Stripe, Figma, even PagerDuty -- was aggressive about distribution from day one.

I'm passing. This is a well-understood market without a structural inflection, facing free incumbents who could add version gating in a sprint. The bundling thesis is logical but the technical barrier to replication is low, the switching costs are minimal, and the pricing doesn't support the kind of enterprise-grade stickiness that turns developer tools into platforms. The founders have relevant experience, particularly Ashish's indie developer background, but the company needs multiple things to work simultaneously -- developer adoption against Firebase's free tier, platform expansion beyond three features, and Android/Flutter support to address the full market -- which starts to look like a multi-miracle plan. A smart SDK bundle is still just a bundle.
