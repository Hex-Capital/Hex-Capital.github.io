# Pollinate -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Two pivots in under two years -- from a nightlife app connecting partygoers with clubs, to food wholesale supply chain, to hard tech manufacturing ERP automation -- is the most revealing signal in this dossier. Pivots are normal at pre-seed. But the trajectory here tells me something specific: these founders are searching for a problem, not building from a deep well of knowledge about one. The supply chain insight came from delivering wholesale vegetables to restaurants during their food-industry phase. That's observational exposure, not the kind of understanding that takes years to accumulate and can't be replicated by a smart generalist with a few months of customer interviews. When I backed Stack Overflow, Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood had spent years immersed in developer communities, understanding the friction of knowledge transfer between programmers at an almost molecular level. Pollinate's founders discovered supply chain pain points through a pivot -- they didn't arrive with knowledge that would take a competitor years to match.

The leverage architecture concerns me more than the market opportunity. The company explicitly describes an 80/20 model: 80% platform, 20% bespoke customization per customer. That 20% is a gravity well. Each new ERP integration, each customer's idiosyncratic workflow configuration -- this is labor that scales linearly with customers. A two-person team doing custom integration work for hardware manufacturers is not a leveraged business; it's a consulting practice with a software layer on top. The platform component could eventually dominate, but right now the company is selling time alongside code. I look for businesses where one engineer's work serves millions. Here, each new customer pulls engineering hours toward customization rather than toward building something that compounds.

The competitive landscape makes the contrarian case impossible to argue. "AI agents for supply chain" is the consensus bet of 2025-2026. Levelpath has raised $100M+. Order.co is at $29M in revenue. Basware has processed 2 billion invoices. There's a direct YC-batch competitor -- Ovlo -- offering an overlapping value proposition. The three-way match problem (invoice to PO to goods receipt) is well-understood and already served by multiple AI-powered solutions. When everyone agrees the incumbents are slow and the market is ripe for AI disruption, that's not a contrarian insight -- that's a slide deck everyone has seen. The "why now" is LLMs making document extraction cheaper, but that enabling technology is equally available to every competitor, including the incumbents adding AI modules to their existing platforms.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the ontology layer -- the structured data model Pollinate builds on top of heterogeneous ERP systems -- becomes a genuine compounding asset over time. If every customer's workflow data enriches the ontology, making the next deployment faster and the agents smarter, you'd get a flywheel: more customers, richer ontology, faster deployment, more customers. That's how Alchemy built defensibility in blockchain infrastructure -- each developer integration strengthened the platform for the next one. If the 80/20 ratio flips to 95/5 as the ontology matures, the leverage problem resolves itself. And the founders' willingness to spend their life savings at 18 to fly across Australia for customer conversations, then drop out of university to pursue this -- that's real energy. But energy without specific knowledge is just hard work without direction. The pivot history suggests the energy is real but the compass is still spinning.

Corey Berther coding since age 12 and having a physics background is the one signal that holds weight in my technical-cofounder filter. He's a builder, not a hired gun. But I can't evaluate what he's built -- no public GitHub repos, no visible technical artifacts. The ontology concept is architecturally interesting but unproven, and at this stage I'm being asked to trust the concept rather than evaluate the execution. The $100k+ in purchasing volume processed is not revenue -- it's the dollar value of POs flowing through the system, which tells me very little about whether customers are paying meaningful amounts for the service.

I'd pass. The founders have energy and hustle, but their supply chain knowledge was acquired incidentally through a pivot, not through the kind of obsessive domain immersion that produces insights competitors can't replicate. The business model has a structural leverage limitation baked into its delivery model. And the market timing is consensus, not contrarian -- which means the pricing of this opportunity already reflects the optimism, even at the pre-seed stage. I want founders who know something that can't be taught, building leverage that didn't previously exist, at a moment when informed people think they're wrong. Pollinate is competent founders who learned something teachable, building automation that already exists elsewhere, at a time when everyone agrees this is the right bet.
