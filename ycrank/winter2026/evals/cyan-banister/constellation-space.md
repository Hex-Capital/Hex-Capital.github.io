# Constellation Space -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Constellation Space: the founder-market fit is technically impeccable, and that's exactly what makes this a complicated pass for me. Kamran Majid literally built the anomaly detection system for Starlink's ground network at SpaceX. Raaid Kabir wrote embedded flight software for Blue Origin's New Glenn program. These aren't adjacent credentials -- these are the people who lived inside the exact operational problem they're now trying to solve. If I evaluated companies purely on technical domain credibility, this team would be near the top of anything I've seen in space infrastructure. But I don't evaluate companies that way.

When I sit down with founders, I want to hear the story before the business -- and what I'm listening for is the hardship, the obsession, the biographical thread that makes this person incapable of doing anything other than solving this specific problem. What I see with this team is four highly credentialed engineers who all worked at Capital One before branching into their respective space and AI roles. They identified a real technical gap from their professional vantage points, and they're building a smart solution to it. That's a legitimate company-building path, but it doesn't give me the signal I rely on most heavily. There's no survival story here, no "I was told no fifty times and kept going," no personal stake that transcends career logic. When the inevitable crisis comes -- and in aerospace with 12-24 month sales cycles and a narrow customer base, that crisis will come -- I need to know what keeps these founders at the table when the rational move is to walk away. Professional expertise doesn't answer that question for me.

The other thing that concerns me is that this doesn't feel like the kind of bet I'm drawn to. Space infrastructure AI is a crowded, increasingly validated category. Aalyria spun out of Google with government contracts in hand. Cognitive Space has $11.2 million and relationships with DARPA, Space Force, and the Air Force Research Lab. Quindar raised $27 million and came through YC four years before Constellation. When I look at my best investments -- SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, Crusoe Energy when people laughed at Bitcoin mining on gas flares, Contraline when male contraception couldn't get a meeting -- the common thread is that nobody else wanted to be in the room. Here, everyone's already in the room. The prediction-specific angle is narrower than what competitors offer, but it's a feature-level differentiation, not a category-level one. Kratos or Aalyria could build a predictive link failure module in a product cycle. That's not a moat I'd stake my own money on.

To be fair, the strongest bull case deserves real consideration. If you believe that satellite constellations will grow from thousands to tens of thousands of satellites over the next five years -- and the Blue Origin TeraWave and Amazon Kuiper announcements suggest this is happening -- then the manual monitoring problem becomes genuinely untenable. Constellation's physics-informed ML approach, combining ITU atmospheric models with machine learning at 100,000 messages per second, is technically sophisticated enough that it can't be quickly replicated by a generalist AI team. The federated learning architecture is clever -- it addresses the very real concern that defense operators won't share raw telemetry with a third party, and over time it could create a cross-constellation data advantage that gets harder to replicate. If Kamran can leverage his SpaceX network to land one major defense contract, the company could establish itself as the category-defining prediction layer before incumbents pivot. That's a real path. But it requires the company to survive potentially two years of enterprise sales cycles on pre-seed funding, in a market where the two largest operators -- SpaceX and Amazon -- build their tools internally and will never be customers. That's a structural ceiling on the addressable market that most investors in this space aren't acknowledging.

On the dimensions I care about most -- creating economic access, making invisible systems visible for underserved populations -- I see a company that serves large satellite operators and defense agencies. There's a second-order argument that reliable satellite connectivity matters for underserved communities, and I buy that conceptually, but it's not what this company is building toward directly. It's an enterprise infrastructure play, and while those can be enormously valuable, they don't activate the part of my thesis about economic democratization that pulled me toward Uber or Affirm or Thumbtack.

The four-founder dynamic deserves a note. All four sharing Capital One as a common employer is actually a modest positive -- they've worked together in some capacity, which means they've had at least a baseline experience navigating organizational dynamics alongside each other. But four co-founders is a lot of voices, and I don't have any signal about how they handle real disagreement. After what happened with HQ Trivia, I always want to understand how the founding team fights before I write a check. Nothing here raises a red flag, but nothing gives me comfort either.

This is a competent team building a technically sophisticated product in a real and growing market. In another investor's framework, that might be enough. In mine, I need the biographical thread, the anti-consensus weirdness, and the real-world impact story to feel conviction. I don't find those signals here.
