# EigenPal -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is: what is the secret? What does this team know about the world that most intelligent people actively disagree with? EigenPal's implicit thesis is that LLM-powered vision models can replace template-based document processing with 99% accuracy and no pre-configuration. The problem is that this is not a secret -- it is a press release. ABBYY is incorporating LLM capabilities. Rossum launched agent-based automation. Hyperscience has $439 million in funding and is moving in the same direction. The dossier itself states it plainly: "Any team with access to commercial vision-language models can build basic document extraction." When the company's core differentiation is something that the dossier's own risk section identifies as becoming commoditized within 12-18 months, you are not looking at a contrarian truth. You are looking at a consensus observation that has already been noticed by every incumbent and every well-funded competitor in the space. This is the Girardian trap at its most transparent -- multiple players converging on the same insight, imitating each other's architectures, competing for the same enterprise budgets. The intelligent document processing market with its dozen funded players and $43.9 billion projected TAM is not a monopoly opportunity. It is an invitation to mutual destruction.

The technology question compounds the problem. EigenPal is building on foundation models it does not own -- GPT-4V, Claude Vision, Gemini. The core capability that differentiates it from legacy OCR vendors (template-free extraction) is a feature of the underlying models, not of EigenPal's proprietary technology. The workflow builder, the evaluation framework, the Grafana exports -- these are competent engineering additions, but they are orchestration layers, not proprietary technology that creates an order-of-magnitude advantage. When I backed Palantir, the insight was that PayPal's anti-fraud algorithms could be adapted for counterterrorism -- but critically, Palantir built proprietary data fusion technology that no one else had. EigenPal is assembling commercially available components into a product. A well-resourced team at any of the four competitors listed in this dossier could replicate the entire stack. This is 1-to-n work -- taking what LLM vendors have made possible and packaging it for enterprise consumption -- not 0-to-1 creation.

I will grant the strongest version of the bull case: the workflow orchestration layer plus SOC II Type 2 certification plus on-premises deployment creates genuine enterprise stickiness that pure LLM wrappers lack. Two large European banks using the product for loan automation is real signal -- banks do not engage with vendors casually, and if those integrations deepen, the switching costs accumulate. If EigenPal could dominate a narrow vertical -- say, European banking loan document processing -- and expand concentrically into insurance claims, then manufacturing compliance, the monopoly-through-small-market-dominance playbook could apply. The evaluation-first approach (testing workflows against historical documents before deployment) could become a genuine wedge with risk-averse enterprises that need provable accuracy before deployment. If Novak's serial founding experience translates into faster enterprise sales cycles and Blaszyk's Elastic and Yelp infrastructure experience produces a genuinely superior pipeline architecture, this team could potentially outexecute in a specific vertical. But "could outexecute" is not a monopoly thesis. It is a hope that operational excellence will substitute for structural advantage, and operational advantages are precisely what well-funded incumbents can replicate.

The founder profile raises additional concerns within my framework. Novak is listed as CEO of Assetario (2020-present) simultaneously with his EigenPal co-founder role -- an attention split that is difficult to reconcile with the singular conviction I look for. He is described as a "3-time B2B AI founder," which sounds like serial entrepreneurship but can also indicate serial pivoting -- the opposite of definite optimism. His intern stints at McKinsey and Accenture pattern-match to what I have called the "men in suits" problem in cleantech: founders who approach markets through consulting frameworks rather than deep technical obsession. Blaszyk's engineering depth at Elastic and Yelp is more substantive and directly relevant to document infrastructure, but I see no evidence of either founder articulating a vision of the future that goes beyond "enterprises need better document processing." That is a market observation, not a plan for the future. Where is the definite vision of what document workflows look like in ten years and why EigenPal is the only company that can build it?

I pass. The absence of a genuine secret is disqualifying. Every element of EigenPal's differentiation -- LLM-based extraction, template-free processing, workflow automation -- is either already available from incumbents or will be within eighteen months. The market has too many funded players pursuing the same thesis for any single entrant to achieve monopoly. The technology is built on foundation models the company does not control, which means the floor of competition rises every time OpenAI or Anthropic ships a better vision model. This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a competitive market -- and that is precisely the profile I avoid. The projected $43.9 billion TAM is not an opportunity; it is a warning sign. Large, visible markets with many players and no structural path to dominance produce exactly the outcome Girard would predict: rivals destroying each other's margins in pursuit of a prize that dissolves upon contact.
