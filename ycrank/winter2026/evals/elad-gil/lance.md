# Lance -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is what jumped out first. Canary Technologies has raised $180M+ at a $600M valuation and launched an AI Voice product in 2025. Duve just raised $60M. When I see a pre-seed company entering a market where a well-funded incumbent has already shipped the same capability category, I ask whether this is a "market-ending move" situation or whether the startup has a structural wedge the incumbent can't easily replicate. Lance's answer to that question is interesting but not conclusive. The Computer Use Agent approach -- navigating existing hotel software UIs directly rather than building API integrations -- is a genuine technical differentiator. Canary's AI Voice is one module in a broad platform. Lance is organized entirely around autonomous operations. That focused-versus-platform dynamic is where startups sometimes win, but it requires that the focused product deliver dramatically better outcomes on the dimension that matters most. The 30% front desk call volume reduction cited by a customer is meaningful but not the kind of 10x improvement that makes a platform incumbent irrelevant.

The structural moment question is mixed. Computer use agent technology reaching production viability in late 2024 is a real capability threshold -- this is the kind of technology inflection I track. Before Anthropic shipped Claude computer use, building an AI agent that could navigate Oracle OPERA or Cloudbeds required brittle screen scraping or expensive custom integrations. Now there's infrastructure that makes it viable. That's a genuine "why now." But the hospitality staffing shortage has been a constant since 2021, not a new inflection. And the market itself isn't non-obvious -- multiple venture firms have clearly identified hotel technology as a category worth funding. When I invested in PagerDuty, nobody else thought operations alerting was a venture-scale market. Hotel AI has attracted hundreds of millions in capital. The specific wedge -- voice-first autonomous operations using computer use agents -- has some non-obvious qualities, since most competitors default to text and messaging. Voice is harder, which keeps competition thinner. But the market overall is consensus enough that I can't classify this as the kind of overlooked opportunity where asymmetric returns live.

What I find more compelling is the product-to-distribution trajectory. Lance already has three distinct product surfaces: a Receptionist Agent for guest calls, a Sales Agent for inbound inquiries and RFPs, and Lance Pad for team operations dispatch. That's unusual multi-product thinking at pre-seed. More importantly, the hotel relationship itself becomes the distribution channel. Once Lance handles calls for a property, expanding into sales workflow and operational coordination is a natural upsell through the same customer relationship. The hotel group sales model amplifies this -- one deal with a management company puts you into dozens of properties simultaneously. The Quore partnership adds a channel dimension. This pattern -- where the initial product creates a customer relationship that distributes additional products -- is the trajectory I look for in generational companies. It's early, but the structural possibility is real.

The founder execution signal is the strongest data point in this dossier. Fifty-plus hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt branded properties at pre-seed stage is not typical. That's not a demo or a waitlist -- it's production deployment in environments with real guests and brand compliance requirements. Caleb Chan's background as founding engineer at a company with a nine-figure exit, combined with product experience building voice and AI agent technology at Google and Salesforce, gives him unusual credibility for this specific problem. Gatik Trivedi's prior exit with MedTec Innovate and agent infrastructure work at GI Partners and Knowtex (YC S22) adds technical depth. The team has clearly shipped fast and convinced real hotel operators to adopt.

The single-miracle question is where I have concerns. Lance's miracle is that computer use agents can reliably handle hotel operations at production quality across diverse PMS systems, property configurations, and brand standards. Part of that miracle is being delivered by the foundation model labs -- as Anthropic and OpenAI improve computer use capabilities, Lance benefits automatically, similar to how Harvey benefited from GPT-4's capability jump. That's a good structural position. But the UI fragility problem introduces a second challenge: every time Oracle OPERA or Mews updates their interface, Lance's agents potentially break for affected properties. That's an ongoing maintenance burden that scales with the number of software systems supported, and it creates a compounding operational cost that doesn't diminish over time. It's not quite two miracles, but it's a single miracle with a persistent tax attached that could constrain margins and engineering velocity at scale.

If I'm being honest about the bull case, it's this: hotels are exactly the "boring but critical" enterprise infrastructure market where I've historically found the best returns. Every hotel needs to answer its phone. Every hotel needs to handle guest requests. Every hotel loses revenue when calls go unanswered. If Lance's computer use agent approach matures alongside improving foundation models, and if the company can establish deep enough penetration within major hotel groups before Canary catches up on autonomous operations depth, the switching costs become substantial. A hotel group running Lance across 50+ properties for calls, sales, and operations dispatch isn't ripping that out for a marginally better alternative. The question is whether the window between now and Canary's maturation in AI Voice is wide enough for Lance to build that entrenchment. Given the execution velocity evidence, there's a credible path -- but the competitive overhang from a $600M-valued incumbent keeps me from strong conviction.
