# Protent -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Protent is that AI surveillance is not a problem hiding in plain sight. It's a problem with $300 million in competitor funding already deployed against it. Ambient.ai has $146 million and markets "proactive threat prevention." Spot AI has $93 million. Lumana has $64 million and 50,000 cameras deployed. When I evaluate a problem, I ask whether schlep blindness is keeping smart people away from it. The answer here is clearly no. The schlep of enterprise security sales, on-premise deployment, regulatory compliance, and false positive management is real, but it's visible schlep -- the kind that well-capitalized companies are already grinding through. This is the opposite of Stripe's situation, where thousands of programmers knew payments were broken but nobody wanted to walk into the banks. Plenty of people have walked into this market. They're already there with big checks and enterprise customers.

The origin of the idea gives me a mixed signal. Balaji deployed "reinforcement learning-optimized video intelligence in classified settings" at Lockheed Martin. Sharma did NLP-based threat detection research. So they encountered this problem through professional employment, which is better than brainstorming -- they actually worked on surveillance AI and presumably saw its limitations firsthand. But there's a meaningful difference between being paid to work on a problem at a defense contractor and being personally compelled by one. Drew Houston didn't build Dropbox because someone hired him to think about file sync. He built it because he kept forgetting his USB drive. The defense background gives Protent domain credibility, but it doesn't tell me these founders would have built this product regardless of whether they decided to start a company. The most earnest founders work on problems because they can't stop thinking about them. Professional exposure is a weaker signal than personal obsession.

The claimed differentiation -- detecting escalation trajectories rather than discrete objects -- is technically interesting but raises a question I can't answer from this dossier: have they actually built it? There's no working website. No GitHub repos for either founder. No prototype, no demo, no pilot customers, no users of any kind. The YC page describes the approach, and Balaji's Lockheed Martin background suggests he has the technical depth to build it, but I have zero evidence that a product exists. At pre-seed, I don't demand traction. But I want to see something built. A working prototype that processes even a single camera feed and identifies a behavioral precursor would transform my read on this company. Right now the strongest technical asset they claim -- models trained on classified defense data -- faces a direct translation problem. ITAR and classification restrictions likely prevent them from porting those models or training data to commercial use, which means they may be starting from scratch despite the impressive resume line.

The bull case is real, and I want to name it clearly. If the classified deployment experience gave these founders intuitions about what escalation patterns look like in video -- not the models themselves, but the understanding of what to look for -- that knowledge could be genuinely irreproducible. Commercial competitors training on public datasets don't have access to real escalation sequences from high-security environments. The temporal prediction angle is also legitimately harder than object detection; identifying that someone is about to do something dangerous requires sequence modeling and training data that you can't scrape from the internet. If Protent can rebuild this capability with commercial data while competitors remain stuck on reactive detection, the resulting product would be categorically different. And the defense-to-commercial path has produced massive companies when it works -- Palantir and Anduril both translated classified-environment intuitions into commercial products. But both of those companies had founders with extraordinary networks and fundraising ability to survive the long translation period. With two founders and YC funding, Protent is in a footrace against companies with 100x their capital.

I'd want to see two things before writing a check. First, a working prototype that demonstrates the escalation-prediction capability on even a single real-world camera feed -- proof that the classified-environment intuitions transfer. Second, a specific account of how they plan to acquire training data for commercial deployment given that their Lockheed Martin data almost certainly can't transfer. If the answer is compelling, the technical moat could be real. Without those answers, this looks like smart engineers who noticed a growing market and brought relevant credentials to it -- which is fine, but it's not the kind of organic, schlep-driven founding story that makes me want to invest my own money against $300 million in incumbent capital.
