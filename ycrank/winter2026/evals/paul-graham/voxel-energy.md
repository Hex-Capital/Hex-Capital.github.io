# Voxel Energy -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I want to talk about is Max Pfeiffer's Maxwell Vehicles. Before Voxel existed, Pfeiffer built a multi-million-dollar EV manufacturing business at the University of Washington specifically around second-life batteries and motors. He didn't read a report about the data center power crunch and then go looking for a battery play. He was already deep in the supply chain -- sourcing retired EV batteries, understanding their degradation characteristics, building systems around them. When the data center power bottleneck became acute, he had ten years of battery expertise looking for its highest-value application. That's the kind of organic path I look for. It's not identical to Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive, but it's the same species: a founder whose prior life made this particular problem visible to them in a way it wasn't visible to everyone else.

The schlep here is layered in a way that structurally deters competition. This isn't one hard thing -- it's five hard things stacked on top of each other. You need to procure land (thousands of acres). You need to source and characterize second-life batteries, each with different degradation profiles depending on chemistry, manufacturer, and history. You need to engineer a DC-native microgrid that actually works at the efficiencies they claim (4% loss versus 30% for traditional AC-DC conversion). You need to physically build the data centers. And you need to operate them at the 99.99% uptime data center customers demand -- off-grid, with weather-dependent generation. Each of those layers repels a different category of potential competitor. Software companies won't touch the physical infrastructure. Energy companies don't understand data center operations. Data center REITs like Equinix are fundamentally real estate operators, not vertically integrated power providers. The combination creates something like a natural moat, not because any individual piece is impossible, but because the schlep of doing all five simultaneously causes most people's unconscious to steer them away. That's what I mean by schlep blindness -- the barrier isn't intellectual, it's motivational.

The team composition reinforces this. Spencer brought 7.5 years at Tesla Autopilot and three prior hardware companies. Pfeiffer brings the battery domain expertise from Maxwell Vehicles. Schmidt contributes a decade of data center and commercial construction management. These are people who build physical things. They already have an operational prototype running off-grid compute, they've contracted thousands of acres of land, and they're accumulating battery inventory. That's not PowerPoint -- that's execution on the supply side. Hardware founders who've already built hardware companies are a different animal than software engineers who decided to do a hardware startup.

But here's what gives me pause. Crusoe has $3.9 billion and a partnership with Redwood Materials to build off-grid data centers using second-life EV batteries. That's not an adjacent competitor -- that's a direct overlap at a hundred times the capitalization. Crusoe has 86 operational sites and a 45 GW power pipeline. Voxel has a prototype. The argument that Crusoe's DNA is gas-flaring and they're pivoting toward batteries -- that Voxel's DC-native architecture is fundamentally different -- may be true, but when a $3.9B company is already occupying your exact space, the execution window narrows considerably. The data center power market is large enough for multiple winners in theory, but the supply side (land, batteries, permits) is finite, and well-capitalized competitors can lock up supply faster. This is different from software where a three-person team can out-execute a thousand-person company. In physical infrastructure, capital is oxygen.

The bull case is clear and compelling. If Voxel's DC microgrid architecture genuinely delivers 4% energy loss versus 30% conventional, that's not an incremental improvement -- it's a structural efficiency advantage that translates directly to lower cost per compute hour. If the second-life battery supply chain scales as projected (41% CAGR through 2040), and Pfeiffer's Maxwell Vehicles relationships give Voxel preferred access to battery inventory, they could build a supply-side moat that matters even against better-funded competitors. And the off-grid approach genuinely bypasses the five-year utility interconnection queue, which is the actual binding constraint on AI infrastructure deployment today. If you believe AI compute demand will continue accelerating and that grid power will remain the bottleneck for years, then the company solving "how do you power a data center without the grid" is enormously valuable. The Boom Supersonic part of my brain -- the part willing to make outsized bets on frighteningly ambitious physical infrastructure -- finds this genuinely exciting.

What holds me back is the absence of demand-side evidence. "Accepting capacity reservations" is a supply-side statement, not proof anyone has reserved anything. I don't see a named customer, a signed LOI, or revenue. At pre-seed for a hardware company, that's understandable but not reassuring. When Airbnb's founders went to NYC, they found hosts who needed the rentals to pay their rent -- real economic dependency. I want to see the equivalent here: a specific AI company that has been stuck in a utility queue for two years and is desperate enough to commit to an off-grid provider with a prototype. That signal would change my calculus significantly. Without it, I'm investing in a team and an architecture, not in demonstrated demand.

This is the kind of company I'd keep watching closely. The organic origin is genuine, the schlep is real and multi-layered, and the founders can build. But the combination of Crusoe's head start, the capital intensity of the business, and the absence of any customer evidence makes this a company where I'd want to see one more data point before writing a check.
