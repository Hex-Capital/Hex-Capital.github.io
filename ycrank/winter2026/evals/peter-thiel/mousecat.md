# MouseCat -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me everything I need to know before I examine anything else. Sardine raised $70 million in February 2025 with an explicit mandate to build "intelligent agents designed to streamline fraud and compliance operations." That is not an adjacent thesis or a distant threat -- it is MouseCat's thesis, stated verbatim, funded to the tune of nine figures, and backed by 100+ enterprise customers and 130% year-over-year ARR growth. Sift sits at a billion-dollar valuation with 34,000 sites on its platform. DataVisor pulled $31 million in revenue in 2023. Unit21 has Tiger Global's backing and its own workflow automation approach. When I see five well-capitalized companies converging on the same idea at the same time, I do not see a market -- I see a Girardian mimetic crisis. Everyone is imitating everyone else into mutual destruction. The dossier's own "why now" section frames Sardine's announcement as "validating the category timing." Validation is precisely the wrong word. When the largest incumbent publicly validates your thesis with $70 million, you do not have a secret. You have consensus.

What would the secret be here? The strongest formulation is something like: "Existing fraud platforms are structurally incapable of building investigation automation because their architectures and business models are organized around real-time transaction scoring, and the investigative workflow requires a fundamentally different product DNA." This is the innovator's dilemma argument, and it has intellectual merit. But the dossier itself undermines it -- Sardine has already announced agentic investigation features, suggesting the product-focus conflict is navigable, not structural. Moreover, MouseCat depends on these same vendors for its input signals. Sardine is listed as both an integration partner and a direct competitor, which is a relationship that resolves in exactly one direction when a startup threatens an incumbent's expansion plans.

The founders deserve genuine respect. Aldridge spent six and a half years as a Principal Engineer at AWS building the exact infrastructure -- Bedrock Agents, AgentCore, Knowledge Bases -- that powers the kind of agentic investigation workflows MouseCat deploys. McAllister spent four years at Coinbase building ML models specifically for account takeover and ACH fraud risk, then published on the engineering blog about it. He has a prior exit, albeit a small one. This is not a generic "AI plus vertical" team -- these are two people who independently built the two halves of this product at Amazon and Coinbase respectively. If I were evaluating founder-market fit in isolation, this would score well. The complementarity is precise rather than approximate. But founder-market fit is necessary, not sufficient. Plenty of deeply qualified engineers build companies in crowded markets and watch their margins erode to zero as every competitor with more capital and more customers builds the same features.

The technology itself is an application layer, not a discontinuity. MouseCat orchestrates LLMs to perform multi-step investigation workflows -- web scraping, phone calls, graph analysis -- and generates synthetic labels for fraud detection. These are real capabilities, but they are assembled from commodity components. The synthetic label generation technique is a published research area. The LLM orchestration is reproducible by any competent ML team with access to the same foundation models. The dossier's assessment that "the barrier to replication is moderate" is generous. Aldridge's MCP expertise gives him implementation speed, not structural advantage. When I backed Palantir, the technology was a genuine leap -- PayPal's anti-fraud algorithms adapted for intelligence analysis in a way that created capabilities the intelligence community literally did not have. MouseCat is automating existing workflows with off-the-shelf AI, which is useful but not a new category of capability.

The bull case, stated as honestly as I can: if the "investigation-to-production-rule pipeline" is genuinely a distinct product category that incumbents cannot serve well -- if Sardine's real-time scoring architecture truly cannot accommodate the analyst-facing investigation workflow without a ground-up rebuild -- then MouseCat could own a layer of the fraud stack that no incumbent occupies. The founders are technically the right people to build it. If they can embed their generated rules and features deeply enough in customers' Databricks and Snowflake infrastructure, switching costs develop organically. And if the "2nd highest-rated company of the YC product showcase" signal reflects genuine enterprise buyer enthusiasm, they may be further along in customer conversations than the public data suggests. For this to be a great investment, the layer thesis has to be correct, the incumbents have to be structurally unable to replicate it, and MouseCat has to reach meaningful enterprise deployments before Sardine ships its own investigation agents. Each of these conditions is possible. Together, they describe a narrow path through a minefield.

I pass. The thesis is consensus, the market is crowded with well-funded competitors pursuing identical goals, and the technology is an orchestration layer without proprietary defensibility. The founders are qualified, but qualification without a secret produces a company that will spend its life competing -- and all failed companies are the same in that respect.
