# Clam -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Clam is that it's building in a category where five well-funded competitors have already been identified, three of them acquired in the past year for between $180 million and $500 million. When Palo Alto Networks pays half a billion for Protect AI and Check Point buys Lakera and F5 acquires CalypsoAI -- all within months of each other -- that tells you the market is real. But it also tells you the market is consensus. And consensus ideas have already been priced. My observation that the most impressive YC companies lately are not working on AI applies here in a specific way: "AI agent security" is not a problem hiding in plain sight due to schlep blindness. It's a problem that every enterprise CTO, every cybersecurity vendor, and every VC already knows about. The schlep test asks whether the problem is ugly enough that smart people unconsciously look away. Nobody is looking away from AI security right now. They're writing $100 million checks toward it.

That said, I want to be fair about the organic discovery question, because Clam actually passes it better than most companies in hot categories. Anshul was the founding engineer at HappyRobot, a YC-backed AI agent company that raised a $44 million Series B. Vaibhav built agent orchestration and containerization at Augment Code, which hit a near-billion-dollar valuation. These two didn't read a TechCrunch article about AI security and decide to start a company. They were inside the agent stack, building the actual infrastructure, and saw the security gaps from the inside. They'd also been lab partners in a Berkeley computer security course. The connection between their academic training in security and their professional experience deploying agents is the kind of natural convergence that produces genuine insight rather than manufactured opportunity. If I asked "how did you find this problem?" I'd get a real answer rooted in specific technical frustrations, not a market-sizing exercise.

But organic discovery alone doesn't make an investment. Stripe didn't just emerge from the Collisons knowing payments were painful -- it emerged from the fact that fixing payments meant navigating a decade-long slog through banking regulations, fraud systems, and financial compliance that everyone else unconsciously refused to touch. The schlep was the moat. With Clam, the dossier itself says the quiet part out loud: "PII detection, prompt injection detection, and malicious code scanning are available as open-source libraries and cloud services" and "the network-level wrapping approach is architecturally straightforward for cybersecurity teams to replicate." When the building blocks are open source and the architecture is described as "straightforward to replicate," you don't have schlep blindness -- you have a race. And in a race against Palo Alto Networks, Check Point, and F5, two pre-seed founders usually lose. The defensibility argument comes down to speed and specialization in the agentic niche while incumbents focus on broader AI governance, which is plausible but thin.

Here's the bull case I have to take seriously: the three acquisitions simultaneously validated demand and removed the best-funded independent competitors. Noma is the main remaining independent player at scale, and they're building a broad governance platform, not a dedicated agent firewall. If agentic AI truly explodes -- agents that execute code, browse the web, and call hundreds of APIs autonomously -- then the security layer specifically for agent runtime environments becomes critical infrastructure. Clam's managed VM approach with network-level credential injection is architecturally clean: the agent never sees the secrets, so there's nothing to leak. If the founders can establish this as the default secure deployment layer for OpenClaw and then expand to other agentic frameworks, they'd own the chokepoint. The founders have the right backgrounds to execute on this. That's a real scenario. But it requires that the agentic deployment niche stays distinct from broad AI governance long enough for Clam to accumulate customers and data, and that OpenClaw or similar frameworks don't add native security features that commoditize the wrapper layer.

The platform dependency concern is genuine. Being tightly coupled to OpenClaw means Clam's trajectory depends partly on a platform they don't control. If OpenClaw adds built-in security features, or if a competing framework with native security wins the agent wars, Clam's positioning erodes. This is the "requires more than one miracle" pattern -- they need agentic AI to grow massively AND their specific niche to remain underserved by incumbents AND their platform dependency to not bite them. Each condition is plausible, but the conjunction gets thinner.

On the team itself: technically capable founders from strong institutions who built real things at real companies. Both are Berkeley CS, both shipped infrastructure at companies I've heard of. I don't see public GitHub repos, which makes it harder to assess whether they're the type who stay up all night finishing code or the type who manage other people's code. At pre-seed, the absence isn't damning, but I notice it. What I don't see is any evidence of the relentlessly resourceful pattern -- no story of creative problem-solving under adversity, no unscalable early tactics, no signal that these founders will find a way when the obvious path is blocked. They may well have that quality; I just can't see it yet. And with zero evidence of user pull -- no revenue, no user counts, no waitlist, no organic community -- I'm left evaluating the idea and the team in a vacuum, which at pre-seed is normal but doesn't give me conviction.
