# Travo -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Travo is what's missing from the story: the biographical thread that would tell me why four Stanford CS undergrads are building a data platform for RV parks. When I sit down with a founder, I'm not asking about the market size or the AI architecture -- I'm asking how they got here. What happened in your life that made this the problem you had to solve? And with Travo, I genuinely cannot find that thread. Clarence Chen built and sold an education company. Alexander Calafiura practiced law at Wachtell Lipton, one of the most elite firms in the country. Michael Dalva wrote code for satellites. Ashwin Sriram built backend systems at Roblox. These are impressive credentials, each one individually. But not a single one of them connects to RV parks, to real estate data fragmentation, to the specific pain of an investor trying to underwrite a niche asset and finding nothing but spreadsheets stitched together from county records. That absence of biographical connection is the loudest signal in this dossier for me.

I keep looking for the weirdness -- that quality I've learned to trust where an idea sounds ridiculous to everyone else but is grounded in something real. "AI for real estate data" in 2026 is about as consensus as it gets. Every YC batch has companies using LLMs to aggregate and structure data from fragmented sources. The RV park vertical is mildly specific, sure, but specificity isn't the same as weirdness. When I backed Crusoe, people thought mining cryptocurrency on flared gas was genuinely insane. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, private rocketry was considered delusional. Travo doesn't provoke that reaction. Nobody's going to tell these founders they're crazy -- they'll nod politely and say "interesting niche" and move on. That's the opposite of the signal I look for. The most promising companies are the ones that make people uncomfortable, and a real estate data SaaS doesn't make anyone uncomfortable.

The bull case deserves honest engagement, because there is one here. The 90% fragmentation number for RV park ownership is genuinely striking -- that's a market where data really is locked in county assessor offices and disparate listing sites, and no incumbent has any incentive to solve it. If Travo nails this vertical and then expands methodically into mobile home parks, self-storage, marinas, and other niche asset classes that CoStar and Reonomy ignore, they could become the default data layer for a growing segment of institutional capital that's migrating into alternative real estate. Calafiura's legal sophistication from Wachtell could be genuinely useful navigating the zoning and regulatory complexity embedded in this data. And Chen's prior exit, even though I can't verify the details, suggests he knows how to build and ship a product. The "why now" around AI reducing the cost of structuring unstructured public records data is real. Sometimes brilliant generalists without domain expertise learn fast enough to own a category before incumbents wake up. I can see a version of this where it works.

But here's where my framework pulls me back. When I think about the companies in my portfolio that created real impact, they made invisible systems visible for people who needed that transparency. Affirm showed consumers what they were actually paying. Carta gave employees real visibility into their equity. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities. Travo makes niche asset data visible to private equity firms. That's not the same thing. In fact, better institutional data about RV parks could accelerate a trend I've watched with real concern -- PE firms buying up affordable parks and raising lot rents on residents who have no leverage and nowhere to move their homes. I'm not saying Travo intends harm, but the impact vector runs toward institutional efficiency, not economic access for the underserved.

Four co-founders from the same Stanford undergraduate cohort is a reasonable starting signal for team cohesion -- they likely know each other well and chose to work together deliberately. But four is a lot of people to keep aligned through the crises that inevitably come, and I learned from HQ Trivia that even two co-founders can destroy a perfectly timed product if they can't resolve conflict. I'd want to understand how this group makes decisions when they disagree, who has final authority, and what happens when the company hits a wall. The overlapping edtech connections between Chen and Sriram suggest some prior working history, which is positive, but I can't confirm it from what's available.

I'm passing on this one. It's a competent team with a rational thesis, but it doesn't activate anything in my framework. No biographical conviction linking founder to problem, no genuine weirdness that would make other investors uncomfortable, no economic access story for underserved populations, and no regulatory complexity deep enough to create a real moat. This feels like smart people who identified a gap in a market and are executing against it -- and that's fine, but it's not how I invest.
