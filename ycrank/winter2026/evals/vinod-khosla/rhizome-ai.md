# Rhizome AI -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me most about Chetan Mishra: he was the sole founding product engineer at EvolutionaryScale — a company trying to decode the language of proteins, backed by Amazon and Nvidia at $142 million in seed funding, operating at the absolute frontier of biology AI. He left that to build a search tool for FDA documents. That trajectory tells me something. It might tell me he identified a near-term revenue opportunity that the broader life sciences AI ecosystem was ignoring. Or it might tell me he retreated from a civilization-scale problem into a manageable niche. The dossier gives me no evidence of a larger ambition beyond "always know what the FDA thinks." And that tagline is my answer. If Rhizome succeeds completely — captures every regulatory affairs team in pharma — the FDA still operates the same way, drugs still take a decade to approve, and patients still wait. The regulatory system isn't disrupted. It's better indexed.

The consequence of full success here is a $500 million to $1 billion vertical SaaS business. That's a fine outcome for most investors. It's not what I write checks for. A $9.5 billion market sounds large until you realize it's a compliance cost center, not a system that transforms when you displace it. Compare this to what Pat Brown was attempting — replacing the $1.7 trillion animal agriculture system, reclaiming half the planet's arable land. Or what Pradeep Sindhu was attempting with Juniper — making Cisco's entire routing architecture obsolete. The consequence of success has to justify the attempt, and making regulatory research 10x faster, while genuinely valuable to the people who do that work, doesn't change how the world operates. Nobody's disease gets treated differently.

I want to steel-man the bull case, because the founder's execution is genuinely impressive. Six figures in revenue as a solo founder selling to pharma — one of the most conservative, slow-moving buyer categories in enterprise software — is remarkable. Twenty-plus customers and 2,800 questions answered with zero reported hallucinations suggests deep product quality. The Instabase experience — employee number sixteen at a company built around large-scale document processing for banks — is almost surgically relevant to building regulatory RAG systems. If you told me Chetan's real plan is to use regulatory Q&A as a wedge into a much broader platform that eventually automates the entire regulatory submission process, changes how companies interact with health authorities globally, and compresses the drug approval timeline from years to months — that's a consequence I'd get excited about. But that story isn't in the dossier. What's in the dossier is a well-scoped, well-executed vertical search product.

The technology concerns me independently of the ambition question. Clarivate has already deployed an AI-powered Regulatory Assistant inside Cortellis — the platform already trusted by every top-twenty pharma company. When the incumbent validates your approach within months of your launch, that's not a signal I like. I look for investments where experts and incumbents dismiss the technology as impossible or irrelevant. Cisco's CTO told me they'd never do a TCP/IP router — that was my signal to double down on Juniper. Here, Clarivate looked at what Rhizome built and said, "We should do that too." The underlying data is public. The technology — retrieval-augmented generation over regulatory documents — is available to any team with ML competence and domain context. Rhizome's quality advantage (zero hallucinations, domain-tuned retrieval) is real today but not structurally defensible over a three-to-five year horizon as LLM capabilities improve across the board.

The timing is adequate but not distinctive. Yes, RAG matured in 2023-2025 to the point where regulatory-grade Q&A became feasible. But every vertical is getting its AI search tool right now — legal, financial, medical, compliance. Rhizome is riding the same LLM wave as hundreds of other vertical AI companies. This isn't skating to where the puck will be; it's skating to where a hundred other players are already converging. The rate of change in the underlying technology (LLMs) favors the application, but it also favors every competitor and every incumbent who bolts the same capabilities onto their existing distribution.

Chetan Mishra is building a real business that solves a real problem, and he's doing it with unusual efficiency as a solo founder. I respect the execution. But I invest my own money for consequences that matter at scale — problems too important not to work on, technologies that make incumbent systems structurally obsolete, founders attempting things the consensus considers impossible. Rhizome is attempting something the consensus considers sensible and achievable. That's precisely the kind of bet where you've reduced the probability of failure to the point where the consequence of success doesn't move the needle on how the world works.
