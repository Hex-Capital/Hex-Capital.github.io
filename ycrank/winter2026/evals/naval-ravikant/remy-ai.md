# Remy AI -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I see is the competitive landscape, and it tells me everything about the leverage problem. Dexterity, Nimble, RightHand Robotics, Covariant — collectively $970M+ in funding, two unicorns minted in the last year. Meanwhile, Stanford open-sourced OpenVLA, Physical Intelligence shipped π0, and Google DeepMind released Gemini Robotics. The underlying model architecture that Remy AI builds on is being commoditized from above by trillion-dollar labs and from below by open-source researchers. When the foundation is free and the application layer is dominated by players with hundred-million-dollar war chests, you need an extraordinary reason to believe a two-person team wins. That reason has to live in the founders' specific knowledge — something they understand about this problem that the well-funded competitors and the open-source community structurally cannot see.

I don't find it. Oscar Brisset spent eighteen months at BCG X advising Fortune 500 logistics companies. That's consulting — the definition of teachable, transferable knowledge. He learned the domain the way any smart generalist learns a domain: by interviewing operators, synthesizing frameworks, making slide decks. Ben Kaye has genuine technical depth — an Oxford DPhil in the Visual Geometry Group, a CVPR 2025 publication on 3D shape reconstruction. That's real. But it's academic computer vision, not warehouse manipulation. His published work is on pose estimation, not on the messy physics of picking irregularly shaped products from bins in dusty fulfillment centers. The combination — consultant who understands logistics plus researcher who understands vision — is competent, but it's a team that a recruiter could assemble. I'm looking for knowledge that emerges from years of obsessive engagement with a specific problem. Neither founder appears to have spent time inside a warehouse building or operating automation systems. The insight that 80% of warehouses are unautomated is available to anyone who reads an industry report.

The bull case deserves serious consideration: brownfield deployment to cost-sensitive mid-market 3PLs is a positioning that well-funded incumbents are structurally disincentivized to pursue. Dexterity and Nimble sell $100K+ systems through enterprise sales teams — their unit economics and org structure are optimized for large facilities. Moving downmarket would cannibalize margins and retrain their sales force. This is the classic innovator's dilemma angle, and it's real. If Remy can build a robot at 50% lower cost that drops into existing workstations without facility redesign, they could own the long tail the way Shopify owned small merchants that enterprise e-commerce platforms ignored. The VLA commoditization could even help — if foundation models become free, differentiation shifts to deployment know-how and hardware design, which is where Remy claims to compete. For this to work, three things must be true simultaneously: the training pipeline's data-efficiency claim must hold up (unvalidated), the hardware must be manufacturable at the claimed price point (no supply chain disclosed), and mid-market 3PLs must adopt without the enterprise sales machinery competitors have built. That's three simultaneous leaps of faith with no pilot deployment or customer name to anchor any of them.

The leverage architecture is my deeper concern. Physical robots in warehouses are fundamentally unleveraged at the deployment layer — each facility requires manufacturing, shipping, installation, and maintenance of physical hardware. The leverage has to come from the model layer, where one training pipeline serves all deployments. But the model layer is precisely what's being commoditized. This is the worst of both worlds: hardware drag on the delivery side, open-source erosion on the intelligence side. Compare this to my investment in Alchemy, which provides developer infrastructure for blockchain — pure software leverage, where one API call serves millions of transactions. Or Stack Overflow, where each question-and-answer pair compounds the knowledge graph for every subsequent user. Remy's potential compounding mechanism — deployment data from warehouse environments creating a data moat — requires getting robots into warehouses first, which requires solving the hardware manufacturing and sales problems that the data moat is supposed to fund. It's a chicken-and-egg that capital-intensive robotics companies have historically struggled with.

The timing isn't contrarian either. Warehouse robotics is peak consensus right now — every major VC has a thesis about automation replacing warehouse labor, two competitors reached unicorn status in the last year, and the "Why now" narrative (VLA maturity, labor shortages, declining hardware costs) is on every pitch deck in the category. The brownfield angle adds a twist, but it doesn't make the bet non-consensus. It makes it a lower-price-point entry into a consensus market. That's a strategy, not a contrarian insight. I get paid for being right when everyone else is wrong. When everyone already agrees warehouse automation is the future and the debate is just about which company captures it, the asymmetric upside has been priced into the category.

I respect the technical seriousness of the CTO — a CVPR publication from the Visual Geometry Group is not trivial, and there are no integrity red flags on either founder. But I invest in founders who possess knowledge that can't be taught, building products that create leverage that didn't previously exist, at moments when the consensus is wrong. Remy AI has a competent team applying publicly available model architectures to a consensus-hot market through a capital-intensive hardware delivery model. The brownfield positioning is smart but not sufficient to overcome the structural headwinds. Pass.
