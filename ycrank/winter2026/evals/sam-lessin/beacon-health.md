# Beacon Health -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing about Beacon Health that crystallizes my concern immediately: Elation Health already launched AI features natively inside its primary care EHR *at no additional cost to customers* in August 2025. Athelas shipped an AI-integrated EHR the month before. Innovaccer announced multiple AI co-pilots for VBC workflows with $252 million in ARR and a $3.45 billion valuation behind them. When I see a two-person pre-seed company building AI agents for the exact workflows that multiple billion-dollar incumbents are racing to automate, I don't see a contrarian opportunity -- I see a company standing directly in the path of an oncoming freight train of incumbent distribution. This is precisely the dynamic I've been screaming about on CNBC: the winner of the AI race depends on who already has distribution, and in healthcare admin, that's the EHR vendors and the established VBC enablers.

My first question with any founder-idea pairing is whether I'm looking at a sane person with an insane idea. Mark Pothen has genuine domain texture -- growing up in his mother's primary care practice, six months embedded in operations, product work at Axuall. Akahara has shipped AI systems at Conversion.ai and LinkedIn. These are competent, earnest people. But competent people pursuing a consensus idea is the combination that produces the most mediocre venture outcomes. "AI agents for healthcare admin" isn't insane -- it's on the cover of every health tech conference brochure. When AI healthcare funding hits $10.7 billion in a single year, up 24% year-over-year, you're not finding non-consensus alpha. You're buying narrative at market price alongside every other investor who thinks "healthcare + AI = opportunity." The idea provokes enthusiasm, not skepticism, and that's the worst signal in my framework.

The structural moat question is where this completely falls apart for me. My core test: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? Strip out the AI and Beacon Health has nothing -- no physical operations, no proprietary data asset, no protocol that others build on, no regulatory position. The AI *is* the product. That's the exact category I believe gets commoditized fastest. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the individual workflows (quality gap closure, risk adjustment coding, patient outreach) are well-understood processes" and "the barrier to entry for any individual workflow is moderate." When the workflows are well-understood and the barrier is moderate, you're in a race to the bottom on execution quality, and the companies with existing customer relationships and distribution -- Aledade with $1 billion in revenue, Innovaccer with its installed base -- will win that race. Beacon is building a software layer on top of someone else's platform (EHR systems), which means Epic or Oracle Health can restrict API access, change terms, or ship competing functionality at any time. This is the opposite of Craftwork, where the painting crews and scheduling operations create a moat that software cannot replicate. There's no painting crew here -- it's software all the way down.

The bull case, which I want to take seriously: independent primary care practices don't want to surrender autonomy to Aledade or agilon's full-stack networks. They want to capture VBC savings while remaining independent. Beacon could be the "Switzerland" option -- EHR-agnostic, no network lock-in, just a workflow layer that lets practices stay independent and still compete under value-based contracts. If Pothen's lived experience in his mother's practice translates into product decisions that resonate specifically with independent practices, and if deep EHR integration across multiple platforms creates genuine switching costs as workflow data accumulates, there's a version of this that works as a wedge into a massive market. The VBC transition is structural and accelerating -- 50%+ of U.S. healthcare payments now flow through these models. That tailwind is real. But even in this optimistic scenario, the company is building an application on someone else's infrastructure, not a new primitive, and the switching costs from accumulated workflow data are speculative, not demonstrated.

The narrative can theoretically expand -- "VBC workflow automation" becomes "the operating system for independent primary care" becomes "the AI layer for all healthcare administration." But that infinity story is capped by platform dependency. You can't become infrastructure for an ecosystem when the ecosystem's actual infrastructure layer (the EHR) is controlled by companies that view you as a feature to absorb. Compare this to Venmo, which established a new payment primitive that became the layer others built on, or Aleo, which created zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure that compounds as others adopt it. Beacon doesn't create compounding network effects -- it executes workflows, and workflow execution gets cheaper every quarter as models improve. That's a feature trajectory, not a company trajectory.

I pass. The founders are credible but the idea is consensus, the moat is pure software in a category I believe gets commoditized, it's an application on someone else's platform rather than a new primitive, and the competitive landscape includes multiple incumbents with massive distribution already shipping similar capabilities. If the AI component is obvious -- and "AI agents for healthcare admin" could not be more obvious -- every incumbent will have it within twelve months. I'd rather fund the primary care practice itself with a tech layer than a tech layer trying to sell to primary care practices.
