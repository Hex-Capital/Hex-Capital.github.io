# Galactic Resource Utilization Space, Inc. (GRU Space) -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that stops me cold here is the team structure. You have a 22-year-old CEO -- undeniably talented, UC Berkeley EECS, ex-Tesla, built NASA-funded hardware that actually flew to space -- paired with Dr. Kevin Cannon, who is quite possibly the single most qualified human on Earth to solve the core technical problem of this company. Cannon founded the Exolith Lab, created the Planetary Simulant Database that the entire field uses as reference material, received $2 million from NASA for aluminum extraction from lunar regolith. And yet he's listed as "Founding Member of Technical Staff," not co-founder. He previously held the CTO title at Ethos Space -- a company doing complementary lunar infrastructure work -- and then moved to GRU Space. After HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect timing and perfect product can't survive misaligned founder dynamics, I need to understand: what is the actual relationship here? What does Cannon's equity look like? How does a 22-year-old CEO and a senior academic who is the company's entire technical moat resolve disagreements about mission architecture or timeline? The career mobility -- academia to Ethos to GRU -- tells me Cannon is searching for the right vehicle for his life's work, which is admirable, but also that he could search again. This is a key-person risk wrapped inside a co-founder alignment question, and it's the first thing I'd want to probe.

Now, the weird factor here is genuinely extraordinary. "First Hotel on the Moon" -- I can feel people reading that and dismissing it. That is exactly the response I've learned to pay attention to. When I wrote my first angel check into SpaceX, private space was considered absurd by essentially everyone with a checkbook. Mining cryptocurrency on waste gas flares in North Dakota? People thought the Crusoe team had lost their minds. The most promising companies are not popular, and a lunar hotel at the pre-seed stage is about as unpopular as it gets. The ISRU approach -- turning moon dirt into construction bricks rather than shipping everything from Earth -- is grounded in real planetary science, not science fiction hand-waving. Cannon's expertise makes this surmountable technology risk rather than fantasy. If this works, the first-mover data advantages from actually performing regolith-to-brick conversion on the lunar surface would be an extraordinary moat. Nobody else is attempting commercial habitation on the Moon. Period.

But here's where my framework breaks down on this company: when I ask Skyler Chan to tell me his story -- not the business -- what do I hear? I hear a prodigy. Graduated early from Berkeley, pilot at 16, NASA hardware in orbit, Tesla on the resume. That's genuinely impressive for someone who's 22. What I don't hear is the biographical thread that connects this specific person to this specific problem through lived experience or hardship. I don't hear about the adversity that forged an unbreakable commitment to putting humans on the Moon. The founders I've backed who built category-defining companies -- Travis at Uber, the Crusoe team, Contraline's founder after years in academic wilderness -- they were solving problems that grew out of something they'd personally endured or obsessively studied for years. Chan feels like a gifted young person chasing the grandest possible ambition, which is admirable but different from the biographical inevitability I look for. Cannon has that inevitability -- his entire career has been building toward this -- but he's not in the driver's seat.

The strongest bull case is real: if you'd told me in 2002 that a South African internet entrepreneur was going to build reusable rockets, and I'd said "where's his biographical connection to rocketry?" I would have missed SpaceX. Sometimes the founder's conviction and raw capability override the need for a survival narrative. Chan has demonstrated execution against genuinely hard technical problems -- a NASA-funded 3D printer that actually flew to space is not nothing. The phased mission plan (10 kg demo in 2029, then scale) shows engineering discipline, not naive ambition. And the timing convergence -- Artemis infrastructure, declining launch costs via Starship, CLPS landing slots -- creates a genuine window that didn't exist five years ago. If Starship achieves its cost targets and Cannon's ISRU process works on actual regolith, the technical and economic assumptions cascade toward viability. I can imagine the version of this where I'm kicking myself in 2035.

But I keep coming back to two things that sit wrong with my framework. First, a $10 million per-guest lunar hotel is the furthest thing from economic access. My portfolio tells a story about companies that create opportunity for people who lack it -- Uber for drivers, Postmates for delivery workers, Affirm for people shut out of transparent credit. A billionaire playground on the Moon, however spectacular, doesn't make an invisible system visible or create economic access for underserved populations. It's luxury at the frontier. The long-term vision of lunar infrastructure and Mars habitats could theoretically seed future economies, but that's three or four leaps of faith from where we are today. Second, this isn't really an angel investment in the way I think about risk and reward. The 6+ year pre-revenue timeline, the dependency on SpaceX's Starship development staying on track, the nonexistent regulatory framework for commercial lunar habitation, the hundreds of millions in capital required across three lunar missions -- this needs multiple simultaneous external conditions to align. I'm comfortable with technology risk that isn't insurmountable, but this requires an entire ecosystem to materialize on schedule while the company burns through capital.

I'd want to sit with Skyler Chan and hear the unscripted version of how he and Cannon found each other, how they handle disagreement, and what happens when a mission fails. The technical credibility is real -- Cannon's presence makes this more than a dream. The weirdness is authentic and non-consensus in ways that genuinely resonate with how I think. But the founder story doesn't give me the jolt I need to override the structural concerns, and the absence of any economic access dimension means this company is fighting my framework on two of my top three criteria simultaneously.
