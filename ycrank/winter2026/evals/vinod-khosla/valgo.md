# Valgo -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's my problem with Valgo: these are possibly the most perfectly credentialed founders I've seen for this exact company, and that's precisely what concerns me. They wrote the textbook — literally, the MIT Press textbook on algorithmic validation. They teach the Stanford course. They built ACAS X, the FAA-certified collision avoidance system. Every credential maps perfectly to the product they're building. And when I see that kind of frictionless alignment between a founder's expertise and their startup, I don't see audacity — I see the path of least resistance. They've reduced the probability of failure to a very comfortable level. But what are the consequences of success? A better validation tool. A valuable B2B software company. Not a different world.

Let me be specific about the consequence magnitude. If Valgo succeeds completely — dominates algorithmic safety validation across aviation, defense, automotive, robotics, space — the result is that autonomous systems get validated faster and cheaper. That matters. I don't dismiss the importance of keeping autonomous aircraft from falling out of the sky. But Valgo is a tooling layer. It enables other companies to transform industries; it does not transform them itself. The TAM for AV simulation is roughly $1 billion today, growing to maybe $4 billion. Even granting a broader cross-industry opportunity, the ceiling is a well-run enterprise software business — not the kind of outcome where the world operates differently on the other side. Compare that to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, where success means we replace fossil fuel power generation entirely, or Impossible Foods, where success means we reclaim half the planet's arable land. Valgo's success means engineers run fewer simulations. Important but not civilization-scale.

The strongest bull case deserves honest engagement. If algorithmic validation becomes THE bottleneck for autonomy deployment — if the reason we don't have autonomous aircraft and surgical robots and warehouse fleets is that nobody can prove they're safe at reasonable cost — then Valgo isn't just a tool company, it's the gatekeeper for a multi-trillion-dollar autonomy transition. The black-box, simulator-agnostic design could make them the horizontal validation layer embedded in every autonomous system, the way Intel became embedded in every PC. Their Stanford course creates a generation of engineers who learn Valgo's framework in school and demand it in industry — the MATLAB adoption pattern. And the fact that they're defining a new product category ("every two or three years, we invent a category") rather than competing in an existing one has some appeal. I can see the version of this story where Valgo is to autonomous safety what Applied Intuition is to autonomous simulation — and Applied Intuition is worth $15 billion. But that version requires the founders to have ambitions far beyond what I see in the current positioning: a developer tools company for a niche within simulation.

The technology differentiation is real but vulnerable. Black-box algorithmic search for rare failure events is genuinely superior to Monte Carlo brute force — potentially orders of magnitude more efficient. That's not a 5% improvement, it's a structural change in how validation works. I respect that. But the research is published. The textbook is available in preview. The algorithms live in peer-reviewed papers at IJCAI and JAIS. Applied Intuition, sitting at $15 billion with a war chest of over a billion dollars, could recruit from the same Stanford lab and build comparable algorithmic capabilities as a feature within their existing platform. The moat here is credibility and execution speed, not proprietary technology — and credibility moats erode when incumbents start hiring your former students.

What troubles me most is the expert-insider dynamic. I've said many times that "experience is a set of biases that prevent you from making mistakes but also prevents you from inventing." Moss and Katz aren't just experienced in this field — they defined it. That's subtly different from being industry veterans, I grant that. But the result is the same: they're building exactly the company that their expertise predicts. No pivot from a wildly different domain. No outsider naivety enabling them to attempt what insiders consider impossible. Nobody is telling them this is crazy — quite the opposite, their academic community would consider this the obvious next step. When Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in public telecom was impossible, that was my signal to invest in Juniper. When everyone in aerospace told Peter Beck that a private New Zealand launch company was absurd, that was my signal for Rocket Lab. With Valgo, the consensus is: of course these two should build this company. Consensus validation makes me nervous.

The two-person team is technically excellent but homogeneous — same lab, same advisor, same research tradition. For a company that needs to sell to defense procurement offices, aviation OEMs, and automotive engineering teams simultaneously, the absence of anyone who has navigated a six-figure enterprise sale or a DoD acquisition cycle is a gap. Gene pool engineering means identifying your five biggest risks and recruiting specifically against them. Their biggest risk isn't algorithmic — it's commercial. And the team composition doesn't address it.

I'd pass on this at the current framing. These founders are too talented for a consequence-of-success this bounded. If Moss and Katz came to me and said they were using their unmatched understanding of autonomous system safety to build the autonomous certification authority — the entity that replaces human regulators with algorithmic proof of safety, fundamentally restructuring how the FAA and NHTSA operate — I'd lean in hard. That would be a consequence of success worth all this expertise. Instead, they're building developer tools. They're aiming at the target their training prepared them for, rather than the target that their knowledge uniquely qualifies them to see.
