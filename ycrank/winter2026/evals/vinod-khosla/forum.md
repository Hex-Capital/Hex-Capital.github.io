# Forum -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Forum: four competitors are already live or launching in the same conceptual space -- Noise with $7.1M from Paradigm and 1,300 beta users showing 62% retention, Polymarket partnering with Kaito to add attention contracts in March, Zora doing $200K in trading volume on day one, and Kalshi sitting on $1.7 billion in funding with a CFTC license already in hand. Forum has simulated currency, a placeholder website, and two people. The typical venture response is "the regulated path is a moat." But I've seen this pattern before, and what I actually see is a company that has chosen to make regulatory permission the prerequisite for learning. While competitors are accumulating users, iterating on index methodology, and discovering what attention trading actually looks like in practice, Forum is waiting. That's not building a moat -- that's outsourcing your timeline to a bureaucracy.

Let me start where I always start: if Forum succeeds completely, what changes? They become a regulated exchange for trading attention indices. That's a real business -- Kalshi proved you can build a multi-hundred-million-dollar revenue exchange for novel contract types. But does the world operate differently? Marketers get a new hedging instrument. Traders get a new speculative asset. Media companies get a new risk management tool. That's useful. It's not transformative. Compare this to what I look for: Impossible Foods succeeding means billions of acres of land reclaimed for the planet. Commonwealth Fusion succeeding means clean energy for civilization. Square succeeding meant millions of businesses could accept payments for the first time. Forum succeeding means there's a new thing to trade on. The digital advertising market is $650 billion, but Forum doesn't restructure it -- it adds a derivative layer on top of it. I invest in companies where success means the incumbent approach becomes obsolete. Nothing becomes obsolete if Forum works. Things get marginally more efficient.

The founder profile concerns me through my particular lens. Owen Botkin comes from Balyasny -- a $20 billion multi-strategy hedge fund. He knows exactly how exchanges work, what regulators expect, how market microstructure functions. That's precisely the kind of expertise I worry about. Industry insiders build what the industry already knows it needs, following the established playbook for launching a regulated financial product. And that's exactly what Forum is doing: simulated trading, regulatory application, institutional-grade infrastructure, eventual launch. It's the textbook approach. No one at Balyasny would call this crazy. No one at the CFTC would call it impossible. When the experts and incumbents can look at your plan and nod approvingly, you're probably not inventing a new category -- you're executing a known template in a new domain. The strongest outsider signal here would be someone from completely outside finance reimagining what attention markets could look like. Instead, we have someone from inside finance applying what they already know.

The strongest bull case is this: the CFTC opened a regulatory window in January 2026, and if Forum moves fast enough to secure DCM designation for attention contracts, they would own the only regulated venue for this asset class in the United States. Institutional capital -- hedge funds, asset managers, corporate treasuries -- cannot trade on Noise or Zora. They need a regulated exchange. That's a real structural advantage, and it's how Kalshi built to an $11 billion valuation. If attention-as-asset-class is real, and if the regulatory path succeeds, and if institutional demand materializes, Forum could be the Kalshi of cultural relevance. That's a genuine outcome worth considering. But it requires three simultaneous conditions, each uncertain: regulatory approval for a novel contract type, a market that actually wants continuous attention indices rather than discrete event contracts, and sufficient liquidity to compete with crypto platforms that already have users. When a plan requires the technology AND the market AND the regulation to all work simultaneously, I want to see evidence the founder has prioritized which risk to eliminate first. I don't see that evidence here.

The timing dimension is interesting but cuts against Forum specifically, even as it favors the category. Prediction markets grew 400% in 2025. The CFTC is signaling openness. Multiple teams simultaneously converging on "attention as tradable asset" validates the concept is real. But Forum isn't ahead of this curve -- they're behind it. Noise launched first. Zora launched first. Polymarket is adding attention contracts next month. When I backed OpenAI in 2019, I was skating to where the puck would be four years before the crowd arrived. Forum is arriving after the crowd, betting that a different venue format (regulated vs. crypto) will matter more than being first to learn. Maybe. But I've never seen the company that won by waiting while competitors iterated.

I pass on Forum. The consequence of success doesn't reach the threshold where I ignore everything else. It's a financial product, not a fundamental disruption. The founding team is competent but operating from inside the industry's playbook rather than outside it. And the regulatory-first strategy, while defensible in theory, means Forum is learning slower than every competitor in the space. These founders are smart enough to build something that matters at a larger scale. I'd want to see them aim at why attention is measured and monetized so badly in the first place -- not just create another instrument for people to trade.
