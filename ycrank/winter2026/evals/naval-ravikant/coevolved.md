# Coevolved -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The pivot tells the story. In January 2026, Coevolved archived its open-source multi-agent orchestration framework -- a general-purpose Python tool with 58 GitHub stars -- and reoriented as a mortgage origination automation company. This trajectory is the inverse of what I look for. The founders who build defining companies start with obsessive domain knowledge and discover that technology is the right medium. Coevolved started with a technology and went looking for a domain to apply it to. That's not specific knowledge -- that's market shopping. And mortgage origination is not the kind of market where you can shop your way into competence.

The specific knowledge problem is severe here. Mortgage is one of the most regulation-dense verticals in American finance -- TRID disclosure rules, state-by-state licensing, GSE requirements, ECOA fair lending compliance, CFPB oversight. This isn't knowledge you acquire from a Princeton NLP lab or a Five Rings quant internship. It's knowledge that lives in the heads of people who've spent a decade watching loan files get kicked back by underwriters for reasons no training dataset captures. Neither founder has documented experience in mortgage lending, financial services, or regulatory compliance. Athan Zhang has genuine ML talent -- NLP research under Danqi Chen, a prior medtech startup that raised $1.2M -- and Alex Li brings solid distributed systems engineering. These are real technical credentials. But technical skill applied to a domain you don't deeply understand produces a tool that looks impressive in a demo and fails in production when it encounters the seventeenth edge case in a self-employed borrower's K-1 schedule.

The leverage architecture is also underwhelming by my standards. Coevolved makes loan officers faster at document collection and verification. That's valuable -- origination costs exceed $10K per loan, and there's genuine pain to relieve. But faster is not the same as fundamentally new. Compare this to what Replit did: it didn't make existing programmers 20% more productive; it made programming accessible to an entirely new population. Coevolved isn't creating a new category of capability in mortgage -- it's optimizing an existing workflow. Software scales, so there's baseline leverage in the model. But per-loan SaaS fees on process automation is a business that grows linearly with customer count, not one where network effects or compounding data create nonlinear returns.

The timing is consensus, not contrarian. National Mortgage News is running headlines about 2026 being the year of AI adoption in mortgage. Every vertical AI company in YC W26 is making the same argument: "incumbents built their architecture pre-LLM, and agentic AI changes everything." That's not a secret -- it's a slide deck everyone has. Blend raised $685M. Tavant powers one-third of U.S. mortgages. Ocrolus raised $80M specifically for document processing in lending. Candor has patented automated underwriting. These aren't sleeping giants waiting to be disrupted by two engineers fresh from college -- they're well-funded technology companies with existing lender relationships, integration depth, and proprietary data from millions of processed loans. The "incumbents can't cannibalize their own workflow revenue" argument has some structural truth, but it underestimates how quickly an Ocrolus or a Blend can layer agentic capabilities onto their existing data advantages.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that domain expertise can be acquired fast enough through customer iteration to build a compliance-grade product, that the integrated agentic approach creates enough differentiation to outrun both incumbents and horizontal AI tools, and that small-to-mid-size lenders will trust a pre-seed startup with their compliance-critical workflows before the company has a track record. Each is possible. Together, they compound into a bet that requires multiple simultaneous breakthroughs -- which is precisely the pattern I avoid. If the founders had spent five years inside a mortgage shop and could articulate why every existing automation tool misunderstands the borrower intake process in ways only an insider would recognize, I'd think differently. That's the company I'd invest in. This isn't that company.

Athan Zhang deserves credit for the prior startup experience and the technical depth -- the trajectory from TJHSST to Princeton to founding is legitimately impressive for someone this early in their career. No integrity red flags. But I've watched too many smart young technical founders enter regulated industries assuming the hard part is the technology and discovering the hard part is the domain. The technology here -- document OCR, extraction, anomaly detection, form auto-fill -- is individually available from horizontal platforms. The defensibility question isn't whether you can build the agents; it's whether your agents understand mortgage well enough that a lender trusts them with regulatory liability. That requires the kind of specific knowledge these founders haven't yet demonstrated.
