# Patientdesk.ai -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that immediately grabs my attention here is the origin story. Öncel Özgül didn't read a blog post about AI voice agents and think "I should build one for dentists." He ran an actual call center for dental practices. He was personally on the phone, building workflows, training front-desk staff. His co-founder Fikri San Koktas was right alongside him — they built ESO Marketing Automations together, a dental marketing agency serving clinics across the UAE and Australia. These two lived inside the dental front office for years before deciding to automate it. That's the pattern I care most about: the agency operator who gets so tired of doing something manually that they build software to replace themselves. It's exactly how you'd want a startup idea to be discovered — not from the outside looking in at a market, but from the inside looking around at a mess.

The schlep here is also genuine. Integrating with fifteen different practice management systems — Dentrix, OpenDental, Eaglesoft, Curve Dental, Dentally, and more — is the kind of tedious, unglamorous engineering work that makes most founders' eyes glaze over. Nobody at a hackathon says "you know what sounds fun? Building API connectors to legacy dental software." Add real-time insurance eligibility verification during a live phone call, payment collection, and the regulatory differences between US, Australian, and UK dental systems, and you've got a problem that most smart people would unconsciously filter out. That's the schlep blindness pattern: the opportunity hides in plain sight because the work required to capture it is genuinely painful. Arini, their most direct competitor from YC W24, focuses primarily on inbound calls and appointment booking. Patientdesk has gone deeper into the ugly stuff — insurance verification, payment collection, outbound campaigns — which is exactly where the defensibility accumulates.

But here's what worries me. I don't see a hacker on this team. None of the three founders have public GitHub repos. Koktas has an ML degree from Aalto that's still in progress, which is relevant but doesn't tell me he built this product himself. Kaplaner's background is in holding companies and business operations. Özgül is a domain expert and operator, not a programmer. So who wrote the code? The best YC companies are built by founders who can make the thing themselves — the Collisons at Stripe, Drew Houston at Dropbox, Steve Huffman at Reddit. When I look at Arini, their competitor one batch ahead, I see MIT and Harvard CS graduates who were early engineers at Threads. That's the technical founder profile I'd expect for a company building voice AI with deep integrations. The absence of visible engineering DNA on Patientdesk's founding team is the single biggest gap in this company.

The bull case is that domain knowledge beats technical pedigree in vertical SaaS, especially when the schlep is in the integration layer rather than the AI model itself. These founders know which PMS system a 3-chair practice in Scottsdale uses. They know the insurance verification workflow because they've done it by hand. They know dental practice owners because they've been selling to them for years. Sixty clinics across three countries with a three-person team is real distribution, and if those clinics are paying $1,000 a month, that's meaningful revenue for a pre-seed company. The customer testimonial claiming $350K in revenue from Patientdesk bookings in a single month suggests the product actually works and delivers economic value to practices. If the transition from agency to SaaS is really working — if those are paying SaaS customers, not legacy agency accounts — then the growth trajectory could be strong. And the ADX conference invitation suggests the dental industry is paying attention.

The competitive dynamics concern me in a specific way. This isn't just a crowded category — it's a category where Weave, with 35,000 dental locations and $230 million in trailing revenue, has already announced AI receptionist features. When an incumbent with that much distribution decides to add your feature, you need to be far enough ahead on product quality and integration depth that switching costs protect you. Patientdesk's 15+ PMS integrations help, but Weave already has integrations with those same systems from the communications side. The race is between Patientdesk's depth of AI automation and Weave's breadth of distribution, and that's a race where the smaller company doesn't always win.

The geographic fragmentation also nags at me. Three people across three countries with different insurance systems, regulatory frameworks, and PMS ecosystems is spreading thin. I'd rather see them dominate one market — probably the US, where the revenue opportunity per clinic is highest — and expand from there. Facebook started at Harvard. Stripe started with developers. The instinct to go broad early usually comes from agency thinking, where more clients means more revenue, rather than product thinking, where depth in one market creates the foundation for expansion.

I'd characterize this as a company with genuinely strong organic foundations — the problem discovery is among the best I've seen — held back by the technical founder question and competitive pressure from both a YC sibling and a scaled incumbent. If Koktas turns out to be a serious engineer who built the product himself, and if the 60+ clinics represent real SaaS revenue rather than agency carryover, this moves meaningfully higher. But based on what I can see today, the gap between domain expertise and technical building capability keeps me from full conviction.
