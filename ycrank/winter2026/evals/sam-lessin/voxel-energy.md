# Voxel Energy -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the problem with Voxel Energy: the idea isn't insane enough. "Data centers need power and can't get it from the grid fast enough" is probably the single most obvious infrastructure thesis in technology right now. Crusoe has raised $3.9 billion on it. Lancium pulled $1.25 billion from Blackstone. Exowatt got $140 million from Sam Altman and Andreessen Horowitz. When I say I'm looking for a sane person with an insane idea, the "insane" part matters as much as the "sane" part — and "build off-grid power for data centers" in 2026 is about as consensus as you can get in infrastructure investing. Every VC who's watched an NVIDIA earnings call has been pitched some version of this. The specific angle — second-life EV batteries, DC-native microgrid — adds some texture, but Crusoe announced its own second-life battery approach through Redwood Materials months ago. When the well-funded incumbent is already converging on your differentiated approach, you're not non-consensus — you're just undercapitalized.

That said, the founding team is genuinely excellent, and this is where the evaluation gets interesting rather than dismissive. Max Pfeiffer didn't just work at Tesla — he built Maxwell Vehicles, a company that manufactured EVs from second-life batteries and motors. That's not "I worked on a team adjacent to batteries." That's "I literally built the business that Voxel's core thesis depends on." Casey Spencer managed Tesla Autopilot projects for seven and a half years and has founded three hardware companies. Evan Schmidt has a decade-plus of data center construction under his belt. This team has what I call "tizz" — the operational relentlessness that actually matters when you're pouring concrete, sourcing batteries, and wiring DC microgrids. If I were assembling a team to execute this specific idea from scratch, I'd probably end up with these three people. The founder-market fit is as tight as I've seen at pre-seed for an infrastructure play.

The physical moat question is where Voxel activates my framework in a way that most YC companies don't. I say all the time that I'd rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company with a paint layer. Voxel is closer to Craftwork than to a SaaS company — the value creation is fundamentally physical. Thousands of acres under contract, battery inventory being accumulated, a prototype running actual off-grid compute. You cannot replicate this with a GitHub repo and an LLM. The DC-native architecture that eliminates AC conversion losses — going from roughly 30% energy loss to 4% — is a real engineering contribution, not a software feature waiting to be copied. The question I keep coming back to: does this business survive and strengthen as AI makes software cheaper? The answer is clearly yes — AI doesn't build solar arrays or manage battery degradation curves. But does it survive as Crusoe deploys its $3.9 billion? That's the question that keeps this out of my invest range.

If I steelman the bull case hard: Crusoe built its business on flared natural gas and is pivoting to renewables — they're tourists in the second-life battery world, partnering with Redwood Materials because they don't have organic expertise. Pfeiffer's Maxwell Vehicles experience represents years of accumulated knowledge about battery degradation, sourcing, and management that a partnership can't replicate overnight. Voxel's modular, distributed approach could serve a different market segment than Crusoe's 45 GW mega-campus pipeline — the mid-tier AI company that needs 5MW next quarter, not 500MW next decade. Speed to deployment — months from vacant lot to powered compute — could be the actual product, not the power itself. And the second-life battery supply chain is about to explode as early-generation EVs retire en masse, creating a cost advantage that gets wider every year. If all of that is true, this is a Teamshares-like bet — operationally complex, physically grounded, and structurally misunderstood because it looks too hard for most investors to underwrite. That's the version I'd want to believe.

But I can't get past the capital intensity problem. Each site requires massive upfront investment in physical infrastructure before generating a dollar. Competing against players with billions while at pre-seed isn't a narrative problem — it's a physics problem. Voxel isn't establishing a new primitive that others build on; it's a vertically integrated operator competing for the same customers, the same land, and increasingly the same battery supply as companies with three orders of magnitude more capital. If the DC-native microgrid architecture were licensable infrastructure — if other data center operators were building on Voxel's power delivery layer — that would be a protocol position with compounding network effects. Instead, it's a proprietary advantage inside a single operator's stack, which caps the ceiling on what this can become.

The narrative expandability is real and worth acknowledging. "Distributed off-grid power infrastructure" can stretch from data centers to remote mining operations to disaster relief to developing-world electrification. The second-life battery recycling angle carries genuine sustainability tailwinds. The story can theoretically grow without limit — and the assets under contract provide a tangible floor. That combination of narrative magnitude plus downside cushion is exactly what I look for at seed. If this team were attacking a market where the largest competitor had $10 million instead of $3.9 billion, I'd be writing a check today.
