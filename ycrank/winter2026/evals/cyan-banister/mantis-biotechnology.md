# Mantis Biotechnology -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I'd want to know about Georgia Witchel has nothing to do with biomedical data platforms. It's this: she co-founded Louiza Labs, went through YC Summer 2025, raised over five million dollars as CTO, and then -- within the same year -- showed up at YC Winter 2026 as founder and CEO of a new company in what looks like an overlapping domain. Both companies involve digital twins and biomedical simulation. Both share the same YC partner. That's the kind of thing that either signals a founder who learned something profound at the first company and realized the bigger opportunity was in the infrastructure layer, or it signals something messier -- a co-founder split, unresolved IP questions, a pattern of starting over rather than pushing through. I don't know which it is, and I can't evaluate Mantis without understanding that transition. When I think about the HQ Trivia lesson -- the company that failed entirely because of founder conflicts, even though the timing and product were right -- this is exactly the kind of corporate history I'd need to unpack face-to-face before writing a check.

That said, Georgia's personal story has real resonance for me. She dropped out of high school and got into Harvey Mudd, which is one of the hardest schools in the country to get into. I know what it feels like to drop out and then have to prove yourself through unconventional paths -- I did it through public libraries and systems administration. She did it through elite ice climbing (eight world records, Junior Olympics, bringing the sport to an Olympic stage) and then pivoting into computer science and bioengineering. The ice climbing background isn't a resume line -- that's someone who has learned to assess mortal risk, commit fully, and perform under conditions where failure has real physical consequences. That forges something in a person. But here's where I pause: the biographical thread connects her to *sports performance* and *athletic data* much more naturally than to pharmaceutical clinical trial infrastructure. When I backed Uber, the reason I trusted Travis wasn't just his general intensity -- it was years of my husband and me discussing the taxi medallion racket, a lived frustration that made the problem personal. I'd want to hear Georgia articulate why biomedical data infrastructure is *her* problem in a way that goes beyond academic training.

The company itself occupies interesting territory -- a horizontal data layer that unifies motion capture, biometric sensors, medical imaging, and clinical systems into something biologically meaningful. I notice the "making invisible systems visible" pattern that runs through my portfolio: Carta made cap tables transparent, Affirm made interest rates honest, Flock Safety surfaced public safety data that was hidden. Mantis is trying to take fragmented biomedical data -- currently siloed across dozens of systems in formats that don't talk to each other -- and make it queryable, unified, and reusable. That's a genuine transparency play. But this isn't the kind of investment where I feel that jolt of intuitive energy. Digital twins in healthcare is a recognized and increasingly funded category. Unlearn has $135 million. Twin Health has over $300 million. Dassault's Living Heart Project has been running for eight-plus years. When I look at my best investments, they were all in categories where I was nearly alone -- private space, ride-sharing when it was illegal, mining Bitcoin on gas flares. This market already has well-capitalized believers. The consensus is forming.

The bull case is real though, and I want to articulate it honestly. If Georgia has genuinely cracked the problem of encoding biological meaning into a reusable data layer -- not just moving data around but making it semantically aware of anatomy and physiology -- that's a genuine infrastructure moat. General-purpose platforms like Snowflake can't do this. The vertical competitors (Unlearn for clinical trials, Quibim for imaging, Twin Health for metabolic health) have each built their own proprietary data layers, but nobody has built the shared infrastructure underneath all of them. That's the "Stripe for biomedical data" argument, and it's compelling in the abstract. Add to that: FDA and EMA are now qualifying digital twin methodologies, creating regulatory tailwinds that didn't exist two years ago. Georgia has the right technical background (CS plus bioengineering), operational experience from a prior YC company, and the grit of someone who broke world records in one of the most physically demanding sports on earth. If you told me this company achieves even modest traction with one pharma customer in the next year, I'd want to look again.

But from where I sit today, with my own money, I'm not there. The website is essentially empty. There's no public evidence of a working product, any customer engagement, or technical validation. The Louiza Labs overlap is unresolved and raises questions I can't answer from a dossier. The space, while genuinely complex and hard, isn't the kind of stigmatized or dismissed category where I have an edge -- it's a category where well-funded companies are already competing for the same enterprise buyers. I respect the founder's biography and I'd remember her name, but the constellation of signals I need -- biographical inevitability, non-consensus weirdness, and that visceral sense that I'm seeing something others can't see -- isn't quite here.
