# Ruma Care -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I'd want to understand is why Meng Fei Shen left a PM role at Uber -- where she'd scaled Uber One to thirteen million members -- to go work as a medical assistant at a rheumatology clinic in San Mateo. That's not a lateral move. That's someone deliberately stepping down the prestige ladder to put their hands on a problem. I respect that deeply. When I invested in Uber, it wasn't because I studied the logistics industry from a conference room -- it was because I had long conversations with my husband about the taxi medallion racket and because I knew my driver Roger. Meng Fei went and became the person doing the prior authorizations, filling out the forms across seventy portals, watching patients get denied medications they desperately needed. That kind of embodied experience is how you develop the conviction to build something that actually works. And Christina Huang brings complementary depth -- ML engineering at Apple, healthcare integrations at Medallion with United Healthcare, medical device software at NASA JPL. These two met freshman year at Yale in CS50, built something together, went separate ways through serious technical careers, and then chose each other again. That reunion-after-divergence pattern in co-founders tends to produce durable partnerships because both people made a deliberate choice rather than a convenience-based one.

Where I struggle, though, is that prior authorization automation is not an unpopular idea. It's not difficult to assess. And it doesn't make most investors uncomfortable. CoverMyMeds sold to McKesson for $1.1 billion back in 2017. Cohere Health just raised $90 million. Infinitus raised over $100 million. Waystar is a public company with a billion dollars in revenue guidance. When I see that landscape, I hear consensus, and consensus-based investing is fundamentally different from what I do. The biologics niche is a smart wedge -- buy-and-bill economics mean providers carry enormous financial risk on every denied infusion, sometimes $8,000 per denial, and the domain complexity of payer-specific criteria for each medication-diagnosis combination creates real specialization barriers. But a smart wedge in a consensus category is not the same as a non-obvious insight that others have dismissed. Nobody is dismissing PA automation. The CMS rule that took effect in January 2026 has made this a regulatory tailwind that every healthcare investor in the country can see clearly.

What I do find genuinely compelling -- and what a generic analyst might underweight -- is the "invisible systems made visible" pattern here. This maps directly to something I've invested in repeatedly without explicitly naming it as a thesis. Carta took cap tables out of opaque spreadsheets. Affirm replaced hidden credit card fees with transparent interest rates. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that had none. Ruma Care is doing something structurally similar: payer criteria for biologic approvals are buried across dozens of portals, each with different requirements, and the Formulary Navigator tool literally makes those invisible rules visible and searchable for free. When I see a company taking an opaque power structure -- in this case, the insurer's ability to deny expensive treatments through bureaucratic complexity -- and making it transparent, that activates something in me. The 50% reduction in denial rates they're reporting, if real, means patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic conditions are actually getting the medications they need. That's not abstract economic impact. Those are real people whose lives change when prior authorization goes from denied to approved.

If I'm being honest about the bull case: biologics are a $129 billion market growing rapidly, the buy-and-bill financial exposure creates genuine willingness to pay among providers, the data flywheel from accumulated denial patterns could become a real moat over time, and the CMS regulatory shift is creating a window where clinics urgently need solutions. Meng Fei's clinical experience gives her distribution access that a pure-tech founder wouldn't have -- she knows the rheumatologists personally. If Ruma Care can establish itself as the default platform for infusion clinics before incumbents build deep biologics-specific functionality, the switching costs from integrated workflows and accumulated payer data could be meaningful. The niche-then-expand playbook has worked before.

But I keep coming back to the core question I ask myself: is this the kind of bet where I feel that jolt of intuitive energy, where I'm daydreaming about what this could become and it genuinely surprises me? And the honest answer is no. The founders are capable and credentialed -- Yale-educated, strong technical and product backgrounds -- but they're not the outsider misfits I gravitate toward. The problem is real and important but it's recognized, not hidden. The competitive landscape is full of well-capitalized players who could extend into biologics-specific PA without extraordinary effort. The core technology -- LLM-based form extraction and criteria matching -- is technically reproducible. I don't see the kind of defensibility moat or the kind of founder-forged-through-adversity signal that would make me write a check from my own money at this stage. This is a solid company for investors who optimize for market size and execution quality in recognized categories. I optimize for something different.
