# MochaCare -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about MochaCare is the business model choice, and it tells me everything about the ambition calibration. They've built a managed-services layer — human coordinators doing scheduling and hiring for home care agencies, augmented by AI tools. This is not a technology company attempting to fundamentally restructure how elderly care works in America. This is an outsourced operations desk with a software dashboard. The dossier itself flags that the managed-services model implies 20-40% margins versus 70-80% for SaaS. When I hear "human-in-the-loop" at this stage, I'm not hearing a wedge toward automation — I'm hearing a services business that attached the letters "AI" to its pitch deck because it's 2026 and that's what you do.

Let me be direct about the consequence of success. The aging population crisis is real — it is genuinely one of those problems too important not to work on. Caregiver shortages at 59% of agencies, 75% turnover, scheduling as the number-one operational pain point. This is a sector screaming for transformation. But MochaCare's answer to this crisis is to help agencies fill shifts slightly faster and process job applications with less manual labor. If they succeed completely — capture every private-duty agency in the country — the world still has the same caregiver shortage, the same broken care delivery model, the same fundamental mismatch between aging demographics and available human labor. The problem is civilization-scale. The solution is an incremental workflow optimization. When I backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems after losing $160 million on KiOR, it was because fusion addresses energy at the physics level — it doesn't make coal plants schedule their workers more efficiently. MochaCare is making a scheduling spreadsheet smarter. That's not the same category of ambition.

The technology here compounds my concern. The dossier explicitly states that "AI-powered scheduling and ATS components are increasingly commoditized — general-purpose AI recruiting tools and scheduling optimizers exist across industries." The vertical specialization in home care credentials and caregiver matching is real but narrow. WellSky already serves 4,000 agencies with 600,000 caregivers. AlayaCare has raised $294 million. HHAeXchange did $38 million in revenue in 2021 and acquired four companies in 2024. These incumbents are not asleep. The "complement, don't replace" integration strategy — plugging into WellSky and AxisCare rather than displacing them — is a revealing choice. It means MochaCare is building a feature, not a platform. The incumbents can restrict API access tomorrow and this company has no product. When Juniper went after Cisco, it didn't build a plugin for Cisco's routers. It built a fundamentally superior architecture that made Cisco's approach obsolete. MochaCare is building a plugin.

The strongest bull case I can construct: the managed-services layer is a Trojan horse. You get inside agency operations, accumulate proprietary workflow data across hundreds of agencies, and the AI gradually replaces the human coordinators. Over three to five years, the human layer thins, margins approach SaaS territory, and MochaCare owns the operational brain of the home care industry. The data moat — knowing which caregivers work best with which clients, optimal scheduling patterns, retention predictors — becomes impossible to replicate without doing the operational work first. In this scenario, the services model is not the product; it is the training data pipeline. If I squint hard enough, I can see a version where LLM-powered agents handle 90% of scheduling calls and hiring screens within two years, and the managed-services customers never notice the transition from human to AI. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders are articulating this trajectory. There is no evidence they view the human layer as temporary scaffolding rather than the core offering. And two CS founders from Stanford and UIUC — technically strong but with no visible home care operations experience, no outsider's audacity, no signal that they're attempting something the industry considers insane — do not give me confidence that they're building toward the radical version rather than the incremental one.

Nick Walker's personal motivation — raised by grandparents, driven to serve the aging population — is genuine, and I respect it. But motivation to serve a population is different from the kind of contrarian conviction that produced Rocket Lab or Impossible Foods. Peter Beck didn't just care about space; he believed he could build commercial launch vehicles from New Zealand when the entire aerospace establishment said it was ridiculous. Pat Brown didn't just care about the environment; he believed a biochemistry lab could replace a trillion-dollar livestock industry. Walker cares about elderly care, and his response is to build a scheduling tool. The ambition doesn't match the scale of what he cares about. Two technical co-founders with big-tech backgrounds executing a playbook that industry incumbents can absorb is the opposite of the outsider pattern I invest in. I would tell these founders: you clearly care about this population. Go find the version of this problem that terrifies every expert in the field and attempt that instead.
