# Moda -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me everything I need to know about whether this is a non-obvious market. Braintrust just raised $80M at an $800M valuation with Notion, Replit, and Cloudflare as customers. Arize has $131M in total funding. Langfuse was acquired by ClickHouse in January 2026. Datadog ships an LLM Observability module integrated into its existing APM suite used by thousands of engineering teams. When I see $200M+ in venture capital already deployed against a market, with a company valued at nearly a billion dollars and an incumbent expanding in from an adjacent position, that is the definition of a consensus hot market. LLM observability is not "too boring," "too niche," or "too personally unfamiliar" to anyone -- it is the exact opposite. Every developer tools investor I know has already evaluated this space and written at least one check. The structural inflection is real -- agentic AI deployment is genuinely creating new failure modes that traditional APM wasn't designed to detect -- but "real inflection" and "non-obvious inflection" are completely different things. When the inflection is obvious to everyone, the returns accrue to whoever already has distribution, not to whoever enters last with the lightest product.

The "Sentry for AI" positioning is the most thoughtful element here. Sentry built a $3B+ company by being the error-detection-first developer tool while New Relic and AppDynamics owned broader APM. The parallel would be: Moda owns behavioral failure detection while Datadog and Arize own full-stack AI observability. That's a legitimate wedge strategy -- in theory. But Sentry succeeded in a mature market where APM tools had calcified around ops-team buyers, leaving a clear gap for developer-first error tracking. Moda is entering a nascent market where every competitor is already developer-first and the category boundaries haven't stabilized. In nascent markets, broader platforms tend to win because they capture more of the workflow before anyone knows which slice matters most. Narrow wedges work better when the market has matured enough that the broad players stop innovating on specific dimensions. We're not there yet in AI observability.

The commoditization risk is my biggest concern beyond competition. The plain-language custom signal creation -- Moda's primary differentiator -- relies on LLM capabilities available to every company on earth. Any engineering team deploying AI agents can build an LLM-as-judge pipeline that scans conversations for behavioral failures. The evaluation is: "Did the agent claim to call an API without actually calling it?" That's a prompt, not a product. Langfuse and Arize Phoenix are open-source. This is the pattern I describe as software-aware rather than software-driven -- the LLM is performing the core detection, and Moda is providing the wrapper, alerting, and dashboard around it. When the core competitive capability is accessible to every customer and every competitor, the product needs extraordinary distribution or data network effects to survive. I see neither here.

For the bull case: Mohammed Al-Rasheed's prior startup, HookedIn.ca, reaching $125K+ MRR with 6,000 users across 28 cities is a genuinely strong execution signal -- that's uncommon for a pre-seed founder and demonstrates he can build, ship, and scale. If I were to get excited about this deal, the argument would be that behavioral failure detection for AI agents is a new category that will eventually separate from general LLM observability the way Sentry separated from APM -- and that a fast-executing team with this specific domain experience (Pranav's LLM observability work at Cerebral Valley) can capture the narrow wedge before broader platforms realize it matters. The bull case requires that behavioral monitoring becomes a distinct budget line item for AI teams, not a feature checkbox within existing tools. If that category separation happens, Moda's early positioning and purpose-built architecture could compound. But that's asking me to bet that a feature becomes a market -- and that a two-person team can outrun $200M+ in incumbent capital to capture it. Those are two miracles, not one.

The founders have relevant backgrounds and a tested working relationship -- Waterloo classmates, both ex-Shopify. The co-founder dynamics risk is lower than average. The pivot from a prior YC application to AI agent monitoring is not alarming on its own, but combined with private beta and no traction signals, it suggests they're still in the market-searching phase. My framework requires founders to be aggressive about distribution from their earliest days, and I see no evidence of distribution thinking beyond the two-line SDK and the implicit hope that developers will find them. In a space with this much competition, "build it and they will come" is a death sentence.

This is a pass. The structural moment is real but consensus, the product is reproducible, the competitive field is heavily funded, and the path to winning requires outrunning both well-capitalized startups and platform incumbents on distribution -- which is the hardest miracle to pull off for a two-person pre-seed team. Mohammed's execution track record is notable and I'd be interested in what he builds next, particularly if he identifies a market that other investors are dismissing rather than one they're all funding.
