# Zatanna -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Zatanna is that it doesn't look unpopular. Dental AI administration is a space where Trust AI has already raised $6.5 million and put 8,000 dentists on its platform, where DentalRobot has been grinding on this exact problem for five years, and where Overjet sits at a $550 million valuation with the resources to expand from clinical AI into billing whenever it chooses. When I look at a space and see that much capital already deployed and that many players already building, my instinct isn't excitement -- it's wariness. The best investments I've made were in categories that other people thought were crazy. Uber when ride-sharing was illegal. SpaceX when private rockets were a punchline. The signal I trust most is when smart people think an idea is ridiculous, and dental billing automation is the opposite of ridiculous right now. Everyone can see the opportunity. That means the pricing and competitive dynamics are already working against a pre-seed entrant.

When I try to understand the founders -- their story, not their business -- I come up mostly empty. Rithvik Vanga graduated from Michigan in 2025 with internships at Coinbase, John Deere, and Hamming AI. Tarun Vedula is still finishing his data science degree at Wisconsin with Amazon and AT&T on his resume. Alex Blackwell came from Pikkit, a sports betting analytics platform. These are technically capable young people, and the IEEE publication on AI bias shows genuine intellectual depth. But I can't find the biographical thread that connects any of them to dental billing. Nobody grew up in a dental office watching their parent fight insurance companies. Nobody spent years as a billing specialist accumulating the exact tribal knowledge they're trying to codify. The problem they're solving is real -- dental practices are drowning in administrative friction -- but the founders appear to have arrived at it through market analysis rather than lived pain. That's a fundamentally different kind of commitment, and in my experience, it's the difference between founders who persist through the inevitable crisis and founders who pivot when the next interesting market appears.

The strongest bull case I can construct is this: if Zatanna's 30,000+ EOB dataset compounds with every practice onboarded, they could build a genuine data moat that makes their system meaningfully better at predicting claim outcomes and catching underpayments than any competitor. The narrow focus on the billing layer -- rather than trying to replace the entire practice management system like Trust AI -- could be a smarter wedge that lets them integrate with existing tools instead of asking practices to rip and replace. And the dental-to-medical expansion path, if the underlying AI architecture generalizes, opens an enormous market. Healthcare billing is genuinely complex, HIPAA compliance creates real barriers, and the staffing shortage for experienced billing staff is structural. If these founders have the right instincts for navigating healthcare's regulatory maze, there's a real business here. But I don't have evidence of those instincts -- no healthcare background, no regulatory experience, nothing that tells me they understand the specific labyrinth they're walking into.

What I uniquely look for in companies -- whether they create economic access for people who currently lack it, whether they make invisible power structures transparent -- doesn't map cleanly onto Zatanna. This is a tool that saves money for dental practice owners by automating insurance friction. That's valuable, but it's operational efficiency for small business owners, not poverty alleviation or economic access creation. It doesn't put income in the hands of people who had none, like Uber did for drivers. It doesn't make opaque pricing transparent to consumers, like Affirm did for credit. The tribal knowledge angle has a whisper of the "making invisible systems visible" pattern I'm drawn to -- codifying knowledge that only exists in experienced billing staff's heads is a form of transparency. But it's transparency for business operations, not for the people being squeezed by the system.

The three-founder dynamic gives me pause as well. I don't see evidence of a shared history between these cofounders -- different universities, no obvious prior collaboration, no documented stress-tested relationship. After what happened with HQ Trivia, I take cofounder alignment seriously. A perfect product at the perfect time still failed because the people building it couldn't hold together through conflict. With three young founders entering a complex, regulated space against well-capitalized competitors, they're going to face real pressure, and I have no data on whether this team can absorb it. That's not a dealbreaker at pre-seed -- many great teams form at this stage -- but combined with the absence of domain expertise and the crowded competitive landscape, it adds to my uncertainty rather than alleviating it.

I'm passing on this one. The problem is real, the market exists, and the approach is sensible. But sensible isn't what I invest in. I invest in things that look weird, in founders whose personal stories make them uniquely suited to endure years of pain in pursuit of something most people think is impossible. Zatanna looks like a competent team chasing a recognized opportunity in a category that already has consensus. That's the opposite of what gets me out of my chair.
