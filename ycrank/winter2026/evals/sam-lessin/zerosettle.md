# ZeroSettle -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The most striking thing about ZeroSettle isn't the founders or the product -- it's that the company's entire existence is a bet on a judge's ruling staying intact. The Epic v. Apple injunction in April 2025 created this market. A December 2025 appeals court ruling that Apple should be able to charge a "reasonable commission" on external purchases could destroy it. And the March 2026 compliance deadline means the regulatory ground is literally shifting underneath ZeroSettle's feet as I write this. I don't invest in regulatory arbitrage windows. I invest in structural positions. There's a fundamental difference between "this business exists because a new primitive emerged" (Venmo, Solana) and "this business exists because a court told Apple to stop doing something Apple is actively fighting to keep doing." ZeroSettle is the latter. Remove the injunction and there is no product. That's not a business -- that's a trade.

Now, the founders pass the "sane" filter. Two ex-Apple systems engineers who worked on operating systems, battery life, and thermals -- they understand Apple's platform at a level most SDK builders never will. Ryan Elliott has a patent from Apple. This is genuine insider knowledge applied to a real pain point. But here's my problem: the idea is not insane. It's the most consensus opportunity in payments right now. Paddle ($293M raised, $1.4B valuation) and RevenueCat ($119M raised) announced their joint iOS external payment solution in June 2025. Appcharge closed a $58M Series B in August 2025 and is already processing $500M+ in annual DTC transactions. Neon raised $14M from Thrive Capital and a16z Speedrun. Stripe released iOS payment processing documentation. Every serious payments company on Earth looked at the Epic ruling and saw the same thing ZeroSettle saw. When the idea is obvious enough that five well-capitalized incumbents are already executing on it, you're not finding a sane person with an insane idea -- you're finding a sane person with a sane idea, and the returns for that pairing are already priced into the market.

What I'd want to see to get excited is a new primitive emerging here -- some protocol-layer position where ZeroSettle becomes infrastructure that other businesses build on, creating compounding network effects. That's not what I see. ZeroSettle is an application-layer compliance wrapper around existing payment rails. Stripe processes the payments. Apple Pay provides the checkout experience. ZeroSettle's contribution is the MoR layer -- tax compliance across 190+ countries, chargeback management, jurisdiction-specific checkout logic. That's operationally complex, sure, but it's not a new primitive. Paddle already operates an MoR business for digital products. FastSpring does too. Lemon Squeezy does too. Compare this to my early bet on Venmo, which created an entirely new behavioral primitive for peer-to-peer payments that didn't exist before. ZeroSettle isn't creating new payment behavior -- it's routing existing payment behavior around a platform tax. The compounding dynamics are completely different.

The strongest bull case goes something like this: ZeroSettle's single-SDK integration versus Paddle+RevenueCat's two-vendor solution creates a meaningful developer experience advantage. The "Founding Partner Program" seeds adoption with free access for two years, building switching costs as developers migrate subscribers onto ZeroSettle's infrastructure. The MoR compliance layer hardens over time as they accumulate jurisdiction-specific edge cases. And the Apple insider knowledge gives them a technical edge in navigating StoreKit changes and App Review guidelines that outside competitors can't match. If the regulatory landscape stabilizes in developers' favor and ZeroSettle moves fastest among the smaller players, they could carve out a meaningful position serving the long tail of iOS subscription apps that Appcharge (gaming-focused) and Paddle (enterprise-focused) ignore. There's a version of this story where they become the Stripe of App Store alternative billing -- the default SDK that every indie developer drops in. I see the shape of that outcome. I just don't believe the structural logic supports it.

Here's why. My "AI kill test" asks whether this business gets stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper. ZeroSettle's SDK is admittedly reproducible -- the dossier states this directly. The MoR compliance layer is harder to replicate, but it's operational complexity, not a structural moat. There are no network effects. No proprietary data that compounds. No physical-world operations that software can't replace. This is a software tool whose value proposition narrows or disappears if Apple successfully negotiates the commission structure back upward, and whose competitive position erodes as better-funded incumbents build equivalent products. The mysterious crypto/escrow angle (ZeroSettleEscrowKit containing "all escrow and crypto sources") hints at potential differentiation but is completely unexplained and, frankly, introduces regulatory complexity that a two-person team shouldn't be inviting. The narrative ceiling is visible: "help iOS developers pay less to Apple" doesn't expand into an infinity story. It's bounded by a single platform, a single regulatory window, and a single competitive dynamic. I'd rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company racing five better-funded competitors through a regulatory gap that might close.
