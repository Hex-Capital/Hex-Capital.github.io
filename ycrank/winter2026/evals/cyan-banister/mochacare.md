# MochaCare -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I want to understand about any founder is how they arrived at this specific problem -- not the business case, not the market size, but the biographical thread that makes them the person who *has* to solve it. Nick Walker was raised by his grandparents, and that's what draws him to the aging population. I respect that. It's real, and it's personal. But when I compare it to the kind of forged-in-hardship connection I look for -- the founder who lived inside the broken system, who was the caregiver working those overnight shifts with no scheduling support, who watched their grandmother's care fall apart because of operational dysfunction -- the thread here feels present but thin. Nick's path through Stanford, Spotify, AWS, and Microsoft is an excellent technical pedigree, and his AI coursework is directly relevant. But it's a traditional Silicon Valley trajectory, not the outsider founder story that makes me lean forward in my chair. I don't feel the biographical inevitability of this pairing -- why is this specific person going to endure the grinding SMB sales cycles, the managed-services operational headaches, and the caregiver turnover crisis for the next decade?

The business model is where things get genuinely interesting, and it's what I'd want to probe most deeply. Wrapping managed services around software -- having humans actually *do* the scheduling and hiring for agencies -- is a bold structural choice that most YC companies wouldn't make. It creates real switching costs and it exploits a genuine business model conflict: incumbents like WellSky and AlayaCare sell high-margin software and would destroy their own economics by adding a labor-intensive services layer. I've seen this pattern work -- the "do the work for them" approach creates dependency in a way that SaaS dashboards never will. But here's my concern: this is also the classic services-business trap. If the AI doesn't progressively replace the human operators, MochaCare is building a low-margin staffing company with a tech wrapper. And no evidence exists yet on the ratio of AI automation to human labor. That's the central bet, and I can't evaluate it from the outside.

What I uniquely notice is the *caregiver* story buried underneath the B2B framing. Seventy-five percent turnover. Fifty-nine percent of agencies reporting shortages. These aren't abstract statistics -- they represent a workforce of predominantly low-income women, many immigrants, many people of color, who are being chewed up by a system that treats them as interchangeable labor units. Better scheduling and matching could be genuinely transformative for these workers -- more predictable shifts, better utilization, less burnout, more stable income. This is the Uber-for-drivers angle that I always look for: does this company create economic access for people who currently lack it? The potential is absolutely there. But MochaCare's entire positioning is about giving *agencies* their time back, not about empowering *caregivers*. I'd want to ask Nick directly: do you see the caregiver as the ultimate beneficiary, or as labor inventory to be optimized? That answer would significantly shift my conviction.

Now let me make the strongest bull case, because I owe that intellectual honesty. Home care is genuinely an unsexy, overlooked vertical -- it's not the hot AI category du jour, and the agencies being served are small, unsophisticated operations that struggle with basic technology adoption. The "do it for them" model might be the *only* approach that actually works at this layer of the market. If MochaCare can get into 50 agencies, accumulate operational data across all of them, and use that data to build increasingly accurate AI models for shift matching and demand forecasting, the margins could improve dramatically while the switching costs remain high. The timing tailwind is real -- the $2M HHS AI initiative, EVV mandates accelerating digital adoption, and the demographic tsunami of an aging population that needs more care than the workforce can provide. And the incumbents are genuinely structurally inhibited from replicating this approach. A version of this company that nails the managed-services-to-AI-automation transition could become the essential operating system for home care in America.

But I keep coming back to what's missing. The co-founder dynamics are a black box -- Pranav Uppiliappan has almost no visible public footprint, no evident shared history with Nick, and no apparent domain expertise in home care operations. After HQ Trivia, this is something I probe relentlessly, and here I have nothing to evaluate. Two CS graduates with no visible home care industry experience, no evidence of being repeatedly rejected by investors and persisting anyway, no evidence of the kind of authentic obsession that makes a founder survive the inevitable crises. The AI scheduling and ATS components are increasingly commoditized -- what's not commoditized is the domain knowledge and operational playbook for home care, and I don't see evidence that this team has that yet. The idea isn't unpopular enough to trigger my anti-consensus signal; it's sensible and well-timed, which in my experience means the price of being right is already getting bid up.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a market with genuine structural tailwinds. But "reasonable" and "competent" aren't the words that precede my best investments. I'm looking for the magically strange, the deeply personal, the company that other investors are too uncomfortable to touch. MochaCare doesn't activate that instinct for me. I'd take the meeting, I'd ask Nick to tell me the real story about his grandparents, and I'd listen hard for what I might be missing. But based on what's visible today, this is a pass.
