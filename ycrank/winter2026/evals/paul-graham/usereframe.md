# Reframe -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the schlep. Coordinating overseas hardware procurement -- managing BOMs across a dozen suppliers in Shenzhen, chasing down delayed components via WeChat at 2 AM, rebuilding a build schedule because one capacitor has a 12-week lead time instead of 6 -- this is exactly the kind of ugly, multi-dimensional problem that makes smart founders unconsciously look away. Every hardware startup founder I know complains about this. They're stitching together spreadsheets, Slack threads, WhatsApp groups, and email chains to manage interdependent supply chains spanning three continents. The problem has been hiding in plain sight for years. That's the signature of schlep blindness -- the problem is obvious, everyone who encounters it hates it, and yet the solution requires wading into a swamp of logistics, cultural translation, and manufacturing domain knowledge that most AI founders would rather avoid in favor of building another developer tool.

The question I always ask first: how did these founders find this problem? Bryan Zin spent roughly four years as a Product Design Engineer on the iPhone at Apple. He was inside one of the most sophisticated hardware supply chains on Earth. That's not nothing -- he would have seen firsthand how BOM changes cascade through supplier networks, how specification mismatches cause build delays, how enormous the coordination overhead is even at a company with Apple's resources. But there's a gap in my conviction. A Product Design Engineer designs the physical product. They interact with procurement, but they're not the ones running supplier negotiations or rebuilding waterfall schedules at 3 AM. The organic discovery here feels adjacent rather than direct -- he saw the problem across the hallway, not from inside the fire. Contrast this with someone like Tony Xu at DoorDash, who personally delivered food for months to understand the logistics viscerally. I'd want to hear Bryan describe the specific moment this problem became personal enough that he couldn't not solve it.

Eric Wiener brings the technical complement: ML engineering at DoorDash Labs and Zoox, 59 GitHub repos, real work on point cloud denoising and computer vision. He's clearly a builder. The pairing makes structural sense -- one founder who understands BOMs and tolerances, another who can build the AI agents to reason about them. This maps to a pattern I like: a picks-and-shovels play that serves other builders, similar to how Stripe serves developers or Replit serves programmers. Hardware companies are builders, and Reframe would automate their most painful coordination work. The technical architecture required here is genuinely hard -- parsing BOMs, maintaining stateful supplier conversations across languages, dynamically replanning build schedules when constraints change. That's not something you assemble from off-the-shelf LLM wrappers.

The bull case that would make this a great investment goes something like this: the schlep is so severe and so domain-specific that once Reframe gets its agents working reliably for a few hardware companies, the switching costs are enormous -- your entire build schedule, supplier history, and pricing data lives in their system. They accumulate supplier performance data across customers, creating a data moat that improves negotiation and lead-time prediction for everyone on the platform. Tariff uncertainty and supply chain fragmentation are driving hardware companies to seek exactly this kind of responsive, automated coordination. And the Apple pedigree gives them instant credibility with the hardware founders who are their target customers. If all that's true, the $37M that Didero raised is market validation, not a death sentence -- Didero is going broad across enterprise procurement while Reframe stays focused on the hardware build matrix problem.

But I can't get past two things. First, the total absence of any evidence that they've started doing this for even one company. At YC, the founders I get most excited about are already in the trenches -- manually coordinating procurement for a friend's hardware startup, learning which parts of the workflow are truly automatable versus which require human judgment. There's no signal of that. No customers, no waitlist, no prototype demo, no Product Hunt launch. The website says essentially nothing. Second, Didero has $37M and is building directly overlapping AI procurement agents with backing from Microsoft's M12. That's not just a competitor -- it's a competitor with enough capital to saturate the market while Reframe is still finding its first ten customers. When a well-funded company is already occupying your exact problem space, you need a specific, defensible wedge. Reframe's potential wedge -- deep focus on hardware build schedules rather than general enterprise procurement -- is plausible but unproven. The best pre-seed companies I fund have usually found their wedge through doing unscalable things with real users, and I see no evidence of that here.

The founders have the right ingredients for this particular schlep. The idea didn't come from a brainstorming session -- it grew from real experience inside Apple's hardware ecosystem. But ingredients aren't yet a meal. I'd want to see them spending three months manually coordinating procurement for five hardware startups before I'd know whether the organic connection is deep enough to sustain years of painful execution against a competitor with 18x their capital.
