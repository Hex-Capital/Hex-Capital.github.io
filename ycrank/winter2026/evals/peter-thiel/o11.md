# o11 -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything I need to know before I examine the product, the team, or the technology. Hebbia has raised $161 million. Rogo has raised $165 million and counts J.P. Morgan among its investors. AlphaSense has accumulated $1.39 billion in funding. And behind all of them stands Microsoft itself, which has deployed Copilot across the entire M365 suite and reports that financial services firms are its most enthusiastic AI adopters. o11 is entering this arena with a four-person team and YC-level funding. The question is not whether the founders are talented -- the question is whether there is a secret here that all these well-capitalized players have missed. I cannot identify one. "Financial professionals want AI tools that work inside the applications they already use" is not a contrarian insight. It is the most obvious observation anyone could make about the market, and every major player is already acting on it. When your thesis is indistinguishable from Microsoft's product roadmap, you do not have a secret -- you have a timing arbitrage at best, and timing arbitrages do not create monopolies.

The Girardian dynamics are particularly vicious in this market. Hebbia, Rogo, and o11 are all building AI for the same financial professionals, all claiming to automate the same workflows -- pitch decks, financial models, due diligence, client deliverables. The companies look increasingly alike, which means they will compete increasingly on price and features, destroying margins for all of them. Worse, o11 has chosen to build as an add-in on the platform of its most dangerous competitor. Microsoft controls the APIs, the distribution channel, and the underlying infrastructure. A single deprecation notice, a fee change, or a strategic decision to integrate PitchBook and Capital IQ connectors into Copilot directly -- and o11's differentiation evaporates overnight. Building a company whose survival depends on the forbearance of the entity most incentivized to destroy it is not a strategy. It is a prayer.

The founders are 19 and roughly 20 years old, which in isolation I do not penalize -- Zuckerberg was 19 when I wrote him the check. But Zuckerberg was building a product for people exactly like himself. He understood Harvard social dynamics from the inside. These founders have no documented experience in investment banking, private equity, or wealth management. They are building automation for DCF models and LBO analyses without having sat in the seat of the analyst who builds them manually at 2 AM. Ajay Misra's work at Cal AI demonstrates genuine AI product capability -- scaling to 10 million users and $40 million ARR is not trivial -- but calorie tracking and financial modeling for capital markets are categorically different domains. The domain expertise gap matters because the target users are among the most demanding professionals in any industry. A banker who finds an error in a model generated by your tool will never use it again, and will tell every banker they know.

The strongest bull case would require the following to be true simultaneously: that Microsoft's horizontal Copilot structurally cannot serve capital markets, that Hebbia and Rogo's standalone platform approach is wrong and embedded M365 add-ins are the correct form factor, that o11 can acquire deep financial domain expertise fast enough to build credible products, and that Microsoft will tolerate a vertical competitor thriving on its platform indefinitely. This is the Veeva analogy -- Veeva built a $40 billion company by verticalizing Salesforce for pharmaceutical companies. But Veeva had Peter Gassner, who had deep enterprise software experience and pharma industry contacts, and Veeva faced no other venture-backed competitor in its niche. o11 faces at least three well-funded competitors in the same vertical and has no documented domain expertise. The Veeva playbook requires being the only player who deeply understands a specific vertical -- and o11 is neither the only player nor the most knowledgeable one.

The technology itself is integration engineering, not a discontinuity. M365 add-ins that wrap LLM capabilities with financial data connectors are useful but replicable. "Zero context limits" is a marketing claim about their RAG implementation, not a proprietary breakthrough. The financial data connectors -- PitchBook, Capital IQ, FactSet -- require API agreements but are available to any company willing to negotiate them. Nothing here represents a 0-to-1 advance. This is a better wrapper around existing capabilities -- a 2x improvement at most, in a market where three competitors with hundred-million-dollar war chests are building their own wrappers. The technology will not create the kind of structural barrier that compounds over time. This is the definition of a 1-to-n business dressed in AI-era clothing.
