# Aemon -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Aemon is how it was born. The founders were Founders in Residence at Afore Capital -- which is essentially an incubation program where your explicit job is to find a startup idea. Google DeepMind released AlphaEvolve in May 2025. A few months later, here's a company whose pitch is "AlphaEvolve, but as a product." The timeline tells you the origin story: this idea was identified through gap analysis, not discovered through lived experience. Nobody on this team was struggling with an optimization problem for years before deciding they had to build a solution. They spotted a market opening and moved toward it. That's the pattern I described years ago in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas" -- brilliant people generating ideas from a brainstorming exercise rather than from genuine need.

The schlep test is where Aemon falls apart for me. Stripe worked because the schlep was enormous -- banks, fraud, PCI compliance, money transmission licenses across fifty states. Nobody wanted to do that work, so anyone who did had a structural advantage. What's the schlep in building an evolutionary LLM search product? The core technique is published in academic papers. Multiple open-source implementations already exist -- OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve -- and they've reproduced comparable results on the same benchmarks Aemon touts. The circle packing leaderboard that Aemon claims as a world record has been beaten by multiple independent teams using similar approaches. When your core technique can be replicated by a motivated graduate student over a weekend, the schlep is absent. And without schlep, there's no structural barrier to competition.

Now, the bull case. These founders are genuinely exceptional young researchers. Twin brothers who both published at ICLR and EMNLP before turning twenty, with international mathematics and robotics medals -- that's the kind of precocious technical talent I look for. The co-founder relationship is the strongest possible: they've known each other their entire lives. And the legal retrieval case study -- improving recall@10 from 0.540 to 0.912 -- demonstrates real engineering capability, not just benchmark gaming. If Aemon can turn this raw research talent into a product that makes evolutionary optimization accessible to every engineering team, the way Stripe made payment processing accessible to every developer, the outcome could be very large. The research backgrounds map directly to what they're building. These are hackers who can build the product themselves, and that counts for something.

But I keep running into the same wall: this is a hot category with open-source alternatives and a sleeping giant. Google could commercialize AlphaEvolve tomorrow if this market proves real. Sakana AI has already raised $479 million in the adjacent space. The underlying evolutionary search paradigm is well-documented and freely available. When I invested in Stripe, there was no open-source implementation of "dealing with banks" -- the pain itself was the moat. Here, the pain is just product engineering, which is work that any well-funded competitor can do. The competitive dynamics remind me of AI copilot companies where twenty teams are all building roughly the same thing on top of the same published techniques, and the market hasn't yet demonstrated that a standalone product company can win against incumbents who offer it as a feature.

What would change my mind? If I learned that these founders had been working on evolutionary optimization approaches before AlphaEvolve was released -- that they'd independently arrived at this technique through their own research and Google merely validated their direction. Or if I saw evidence that their specific algorithmic approach produces genuinely different results from the open-source alternatives, not just marginally better scores on the same leaderboard. Or most importantly, if they had three enterprise customers who were building their R&D workflows around Aemon because nothing else could solve their specific problems. Any of those would flip my assessment. But right now, this looks like talented founders who chose a problem rather than discovering one, in a space where the technique is commoditized and the biggest potential competitor has unlimited resources.

The founders are strong enough that I wouldn't be surprised if they succeed -- but if they do, I suspect it will be with a different product than the one they're building now. Ideas can morph. Justin.tv became Twitch. The Collisons' first company wasn't Stripe. If Ray and Richard find their organic problem -- the one they can't stop working on because it genuinely bothers them -- they'll be formidable. This version feels like the warmup.
