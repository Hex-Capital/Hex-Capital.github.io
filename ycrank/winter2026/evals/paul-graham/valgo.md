# Valgo -- Paul Graham Evaluation

These founders wrote the textbook. Literally. The MIT Press textbook on algorithmic safety validation. They also built the system -- ACAS X, the next-generation aircraft collision avoidance system that became an international standard in 2018. When I talk about organic problem discovery, I usually mean something like Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive. But there's a B2B version of organic discovery that looks different: spending a decade inside a problem so deeply that you become one of the few people on earth who truly understands it. Moss and Katz didn't sit down and brainstorm "what's a good startup idea in autonomy." They've been doing this work since MIT Lincoln Lab, through Stanford PhDs under the same advisor, through NASA and Reliable Robotics and Johns Hopkins APL. The idea didn't come from a whiteboard. It grew out of their entire professional lives.

The schlep here is real and structural. Validating safety-critical autonomous systems across regulated domains means dealing with FAA certification processes, defense procurement timelines, integration with dozens of different simulators, and selling to engineering organizations whose primary concern is not breaking things that could kill people. This is precisely the kind of ugly, multi-layered complexity that causes schlep blindness. Thousands of engineers at autonomous vehicle companies know their validation workflows are slow and expensive. They know brute-force Monte Carlo simulation is wasteful. But actually building the tools to fix it requires navigating regulatory frameworks, understanding certification requirements from the inside, and earning the trust of organizations where a software bug isn't a 404 page -- it's a crash. Applied Intuition has $15B in valuation and $1.2B raised, but they're structurally unable to offer a model-agnostic validation layer that works with their competitors' simulators. That's channel conflict acting as a moat, which is one of the underappreciated dynamics in enterprise software.

The co-founder relationship is exactly what I want to see. Moss and Katz worked together at Lincoln Lab, both did PhDs under the same advisor, and co-authored a textbook. This isn't a co-founder matching event. This is a working relationship forged over years of shared technical work on the same hard problems. And the technical depth is genuine -- Moss has 104 repos on GitHub with BeautifulAlgorithms.jl at 1.4k stars, which tells me he's a real hacker, not just an academic who happens to code. Katz was valedictorian at WashU and worked at Reliable Robotics, so she's seen the industry side of autonomous aviation, not just the research side.

Here's where I hesitate. There is no visible product. The GitHub organization has zero public repos. The website is a landing page with a mission statement. There are no customers, no revenue, no waitlist, no screenshots. For a pre-seed W26 company, I don't penalize the absence of scale. But I do want to see something built. The textbook is published. The algorithms are open. If the moat is purely "we understand this better than anyone," that's a moat that erodes as soon as Applied Intuition hires three Stanford PhDs from the same research group. Productization -- turning published algorithms into production-grade tooling that integrates with real simulators and meets certification requirements -- is where the value gets created. I believe these founders can do it. But I haven't seen evidence that they've started.

The bull case is compelling: if Valgo becomes the standard algorithmic validation layer for autonomous systems across aviation, defense, robotics, and automotive, the market is enormous and the switching costs are high. Regulated industries reward incumbency and credibility, and no other startup has founders who literally built the FAA-certified system that proved this approach works. The "why now" is also strong -- autonomous systems are expanding into aviation and defense where formal validation is mandatory, and the simulation-at-scale bottleneck is getting worse as systems grow more complex. If they can land one major defense or aviation customer, the reference value in those procurement-heavy markets could be extraordinary. This is the kind of company that either builds a category-defining product or remains an academic exercise, and the gap between those outcomes is where the investment risk lives.

I'd watch this company closely through the YC batch. If they emerge with a working product, one or two design partners in aviation or defense, and evidence that the black-box integration approach actually works with real customer simulators, I'd move fast. Right now, the founder-problem fit is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed, but I need to see the transition from research to product before I write a check. The schlep is real, the founders are credible, and the competitive dynamics favor a specialist. What's missing is the proof that they've started building.
