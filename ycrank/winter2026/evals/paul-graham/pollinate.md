# Pollinate -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The origin story here has a shape I've seen before and have mixed feelings about. Pollinate didn't start as a supply chain company. It started as a hospitality app connecting partygoers with clubs. That failed. The founders pivoted to food wholesale, then pivoted again to hard tech manufacturing ERP automation. Two major domain shifts in under two years. Now, I've funded companies that pivoted brilliantly -- Justin.tv started as a lifecasting webcam before becoming Twitch. But there's a difference between a company that pivots within a problem space it understands deeply and one that's still searching for a problem to match its ambition. The question with Pollinate is which kind of pivot this is.

The answer is more nuanced than it first appears. The supply chain problem wasn't brainstormed -- it was stumbled into. Adeep and Corey were physically delivering wholesale vegetables to restaurants and shadowing manufacturers on facility floors. That's how they saw the ERP mess up close: invoices stuck in email inboxes, purchase orders matched by hand in spreadsheets, procurement teams wasting hours on work their systems should handle. This is genuine organic discovery, and it happened through exactly the kind of unglamorous, ground-level exposure that produces real insight. The schlep here is also authentic. ERP integration across heterogeneous systems -- SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, each with its own data model and API quirks -- is the kind of tedious, painful complexity that makes smart engineers look the other way. Everyone in supply chain knows ERPs are broken. Almost nobody wants to wade into the actual integration work. That's textbook schlep blindness.

What gives me pause is the framing. "AI agents for the supply chain" is a hot category right now. There's a version of this company where the founders genuinely discovered a painful problem through lived experience, and there's a version where they discovered a painful problem and then dressed it up in the trendiest possible language to raise money. I can't tell which version this is from the outside. Having a direct YC-batch competitor (Ovlo) doing essentially the same thing -- AI agents automating supply chain workflows including invoice reconciliation -- is a signal that this isn't contrarian. When two companies in the same YC batch are attacking the same problem with similar positioning, you're in a crowded space, not a hidden one. And the broader competitive landscape includes Levelpath with $100M+ raised, Order.co at $29M revenue, and Basware with 6,500 customers and forty years of history. That's a lot of well-funded incumbents for a two-person team to outmaneuver.

The founders themselves show real determination. At eighteen, they spent their life savings to fly across Australia to talk to customers. That's a concrete act of commitment, not an abstract claim. They're high school friends who both code -- the co-founder relationship predates the startup by years, which is exactly the pattern I've seen work. They've each run small businesses to five figures monthly, which demonstrates basic entrepreneurial capability. Corey has been coding since age twelve and dropped out of a physics degree to build Pollinate's technology. These aren't MBA founders hiring engineers -- they're builders. But I couldn't find any public GitHub repos or technical artifacts from either founder, which leaves the "hacker" signal partially unverified. I want to see the code, not just hear that they write it.

The bull case for Pollinate is that the 80/20 model -- 80% platform, 20% bespoke customization per customer -- could actually work as a wedge into mid-market hardware manufacturers who are too small for Basware and too complex for generic tools. If the ontology layer accumulates structured supply chain data across customers, that becomes a compounding advantage that's hard to replicate. The ERP integration switching costs would lock customers in. And the timing is right: LLMs now make unstructured document extraction reliable enough that a two-person team can build what would have required twenty engineers three years ago. If these founders have genuinely internalized the supply chain domain from their months on factory floors, they could build something with real staying power. The first paying customer since June 2025 and $100K+ in purchasing volume flowing through the system are thin but real signals of product-market contact.

But "thin but real" is where my conviction stalls. One paying customer, no visible revenue data, no organic growth signal, no evidence of users pulling the product toward them. The purchasing volume metric -- $100K+ -- describes what flows through their system, not what they earn. The pivot history, while containing an organic discovery, also suggests the founders haven't yet found the stable footing that precedes real traction. I'm not seeing the intensity of user need that would make me write a personal check. When Airbnb's founders visited NYC, they found hosts who needed those rentals to pay their rent. I don't see that level of economic dependency from Pollinate's users yet. The schlep is real. The founders are determined. But the competitive landscape is crowded, the framing is trendy, and the evidence of genuine user pull is still too thin for my money at this valuation.
