# Visibl Semiconductors -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the story before the founders do. ChipAgents has $74M deployed across 80 semiconductor companies with 140x year-over-year ARR growth. Cognichip raised $33M on a physics-informed foundational model. Synopsys.ai has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. Cadence shipped ChipStack AI Agent last month. When I invested in Uber in 2010, ride-sharing was illegal and the smart money thought it was crazy. When I invested in Bitcoin in 2014, it was dismissed as nerd money. "AI will transform chip design" is not a contrarian thesis -- it is a consensus thesis with over $100M in startup capital already deployed, plus billions from incumbents. You don't get paid for being right fourth. You get paid for being right first. This space has already been priced by the crowd, and Visibl is entering with $500K against competitors who have 150x their capital and production deployments.

The CTO, Jordon Kashanchi, has genuine specific knowledge -- the kind you can't train into someone. Azure Maia is Microsoft's custom AI accelerator, which means Kashanchi didn't just study chip design; he lived inside the exact coordination nightmare that Visibl targets. ARM RTL design, Intel graphics hardware, BS plus MS in integrated circuits from UT Austin, published in PNAS and IEEE. This is someone who has spent years navigating the ambiguous tool outputs and verification cycles that consume half a chip's development timeline. That experience produces non-obvious intuitions about where existing EDA workflows actually break -- intuitions a generalist AI team would need years to develop. I take this seriously.

But the CEO gap is structural, not cosmetic. Bryce Neil's background is Deloitte OmniaAI -- enterprise AI consulting in healthcare and public sector. No semiconductor experience. In chip design, you're selling to teams where the junior engineer has a decade of domain specialization. The person leading enterprise conversations needs to demonstrate that they've felt the pain, not just analyzed it. Kashanchi has the specific knowledge; Neil brings software engineering capability. That's a reasonable division of labor for building the product. It's a harder division for selling it. Semiconductor procurement teams read credentials before they read pitch decks.

The strongest bull case runs through my infrastructure lens. Visibl's "AI-native IDE" positioning -- rather than wrapping existing Cadence and Synopsys tools -- is architecturally the more ambitious and potentially more defensible bet. ChipAgents integrates with the legacy toolchain, which gives it faster adoption but also chains it to the incumbents' paradigm. If EDA tools are fundamentally the wrong abstraction for AI-native chip design -- if the right architecture ingests full design context and reasons across the entire workflow rather than optimizing individual tool interactions -- then Visibl's approach could create the kind of compounding technology moat that integration layers never achieve. This mirrors how Notion didn't build plugins for Word and Excel but replaced the entire document paradigm. The on-prem deployment model is also correctly calibrated for semiconductor IP sensitivity, which most AI startups miscalculate by defaulting to cloud. If Kashanchi's specific knowledge from Maia gives him a genuine architectural insight about why the tool-integration approach has a ceiling -- if he knows something about the failure modes of existing EDA workflows that ChipAgents' integration layer can't address -- that would be the foundation for a real company.

But that "if" carries enormous weight. There's no evidence yet that the product exists beyond a concept. No traction signals, no revenue, no named customers, no LOIs. The architectural bet -- standalone IDE versus integration layer -- is higher risk, harder to sell, and takes longer to validate with chip companies whose procurement cycles already stretch months. ChipAgents chose the faster path and has 80 customers to show for it. The leverage potential in this category is real -- automating verification cycles and design iteration could turn one engineer into five -- but that leverage accrues to whichever company wins the category, not uniquely to Visibl. The technology they're building, context ingestion across design artifacts, is a reasonable approach but not a proprietary breakthrough. Any well-resourced team with EDA domain experts could pursue the same architecture.

I keep coming back to the timing problem. My best investments were bets against a gloomy crowd. Here the crowd is euphoric. The EDA-meets-AI thesis is fully formed, heavily capitalized, and being pursued simultaneously by startups and incumbents. Visibl's specific contrarian angle -- that the ground-up IDE approach is superior to tool integration -- is an architectural opinion, not a market insight. It might be correct, but it's the kind of bet that needs either extraordinary capital to outlast the integration-first competitors, or a radically faster path to demonstrating superiority. A two-person team with YC funding has neither. This is the technology business, and Kashanchi is a real technologist -- but being a real technologist in a consensus market with a capital disadvantage is not the same as having asymmetric upside.
