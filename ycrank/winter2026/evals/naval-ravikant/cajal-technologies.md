# Cajal -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I look at is what the founders know that nobody could teach them. Formal verification is one of the deepest, most culturally specific domains in computer science -- dependent type theory, proof tactics, the subtle art of formalizing mathematical intuitions into machine-checkable statements. It's a field with its own decades-deep intellectual lineage running from Curry-Howard through Martin-Löf to the modern Lean ecosystem. What I see in this team's public record is two capable ML engineers -- one from neuroscience research, one from computer vision and a biotech startup about aptamers -- who appear to have pivoted into formal verification recently. Pedro Nobre's GitHub shows paper plane optimization and vehicle detection projects, not proof assistants. Luke Johnston's documented expertise is ML and neuroscience across Oxford, Cambridge, and UCL -- impressive institutions, but in the wrong domain. Neither founder has visible publications, open-source contributions, or prior work in theorem proving or formal methods. The specific knowledge required to build an autonomous mathematical proof discovery system isn't ML engineering -- it's the deep understanding of what makes a proof strategy productive, how to formalize applied mathematics in a way that's computationally tractable, and how to navigate the design space of the Lean kernel. That knowledge lives in a handful of researchers worldwide, and I don't see evidence it lives on this team.

The leverage architecture is the one dimension where Cajal's concept genuinely excites me. A multi-agent system that autonomously discovers and formally verifies mathematical results -- if it works -- is pure code leverage. One system replacing thousands of hours of manual proof writing across quantum computing, finance, and aerospace. The infrastructure positioning is even more interesting: datasets, benchmarks, and RL environments are picks-and-shovels for the entire AI-for-formal-reasoning ecosystem. Stack Overflow became a $1.8B company by building developer knowledge infrastructure that compounded with every question asked. Cajal's verified training corpora could compound similarly -- every formalized result makes the next one easier. This is the kind of platform-layer play my portfolio naturally gravitates toward. But Stack Overflow was built by Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, who had spent their careers understanding how developers share and consume knowledge. The infrastructure play demands *more* specific knowledge than the application play, not less.

The contrarian test fails decisively. Over $460 million has flowed into AI-for-mathematical-reasoning in the past year -- Harmonic at $1.45B valuation, Axiom at $300M, DeepMind's AlphaProof making headlines, DeepSeek releasing open-source Lean4 provers. The dossier's own "why now" section reads like a consensus pitch: the technology is ready, the ecosystem is maturing, investment is flooding in. When every smart person in the room agrees the moment has arrived, the asymmetric upside has already been priced away. Cajal's "applied scientific domains" angle provides some differentiation from Harmonic's competition-math focus, but this is adjacent positioning within a hot category, not a contrarian thesis. I invested in Bitcoin in 2014 when people called it nerd money. I invested in Uber when ride-sharing was illegal. Those were bets against a gloomy crowd. This is a bet alongside a very optimistic crowd -- a crowd that includes companies with two orders of magnitude more capital.

The strongest bull case: perhaps the founders possess deep formal methods knowledge that simply isn't documented publicly. Perhaps Luke Johnston's Cambridge research touched on formal reasoning in ways the dossier couldn't surface. Perhaps the applied-science niche is genuinely defensible because Harmonic and Axiom won't care about quantum computing correctness proofs. And perhaps in the AI era, the breakthrough layer is ML engineering -- training agents to discover proofs -- rather than classical formal methods expertise, making their backgrounds more relevant than they appear. If all three of these are true, Cajal could build domain-specific formalization libraries that serve as genuine moats in high-stakes verticals where correctness isn't optional. Quantum computing alone, if it matures, creates enormous demand for formally verified algorithms. The infrastructure products create optionality across the entire formal verification ecosystem regardless of which application domain wins. That's a real case.

But I invest in what I can verify, not what I must assume. The Entrepreneurs First origin -- a program that matches strangers to co-found companies -- is the opposite of the long-term convergence I look for in founding teams. Pedro Nobre's prior company Vertebra lasted two years before he pivoted from biotech AI to mathematical proof systems, which pattern-matches to founders who are passionate about founding rather than about the problem. The open-source Lean ecosystem, free LeanDojo toolkits, and DeepSeek's open-source provers create real commoditization risk at the infrastructure layer -- exactly where Cajal wants to play. Defensibility would need to come from proprietary domain-specific libraries, but building those requires the kind of deep applied mathematics expertise I can't find evidence of on this team. This is a bet where the technology thesis is sound but the founder-problem fit doesn't clear my bar.
