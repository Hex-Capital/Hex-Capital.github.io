# Hlabs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what immediately catches my eye: a solo founder is trying to build an entire industrial supply chain for robotics components in the United States. That's not a software project. That's physical manufacturing -- PCB design, supplier relationships, quality control, inventory management, shipping logistics. Craftwork (one of our portfolio companies that paints houses) is operationally complex with a full team. HLabs is attempting something at least as operationally dense with a team of one. Paul Hetherington's engineering credentials are relevant -- MEng in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, embedded systems research, hands-on PCB design he's demonstrating publicly -- but his last company, Mystic AI, ran for six years through YC W21 and appears to have wound down without a clear outcome. That's not disqualifying, but it doesn't scream "sane person" in the way that Anatoly Yakovenko's Qualcomm systems engineering pedigree screamed it when we backed Solana. The competence is present; the overwhelming credibility isn't.

The harder question is whether the idea is actually insane. "Build US-made robotics components because tariffs make Chinese imports expensive" is... logical. It's the kind of thesis that every defense-tech-focused fund and reshoring-oriented investor is already nodding along to. When I say I want "sane person, insane idea," the key word is *insane* -- the idea should make most investors uncomfortable, confused, or dismissive. This one doesn't. Tariffs at 145%, robotics funding at $2.26 billion in Q1 2026, CHIPS Act incentives -- the macro tailwinds are obvious. That's a problem for me. Obvious tailwinds attract obvious competition, and the returns get priced in by consensus. If I'm being honest, this reads more like a sane person with a sane idea, which is the investment category that produces solid outcomes but rarely produces venture-scale returns.

Where HLabs does light up my framework is on the AI-resistance dimension. This is a physical-world business where software is the cherry on top, not the sundae. You cannot download an actuator control board. You cannot prompt an LLM into producing a manufacturing supply chain with quality assurance and ITAR-compliant provenance. As AI commoditizes software moats, companies rooted in physical operations get structurally stronger -- AI drives demand for robotics components (more robots being built) while being unable to replicate the supply chain that produces them. That's the exact dynamic I look for. The 145% tariff on Chinese components creates an additional cost moat, and defense customers face regulatory barriers that lock out foreign suppliers entirely. If I squint, this has shades of Metropolis (parking infrastructure with installed hardware) -- ugly, operational, hard to replicate.

But here's where the Birchbox lesson haunts me: the open-source firmware strategy, while smart for developer acquisition, means the software layer is freely replicable. The hardware itself -- BLDC motor control boards -- is technically well-understood. ODrive, moteus, and Chinese manufacturers like RobStride already compete here. HLabs is betting that assembling a *full stack* of integrated US-manufactured components creates an ecosystem moat, but that full stack is aspirational (the roadmap lists Nvidia Jetson main boards, cameras, and wireless modules for Q1 2026, none of which are shipping yet). The moat today is a $35 control board. That's a thin moat, and the "we'll be a platform" story requires execution that a solo founder building hardware has not yet demonstrated. The tariff moat is also structurally fragile -- it's a policy decision, not an economic primitive. I held through crypto winters because the underlying protocol value was structural. A tariff can be reversed with a single executive order.

The bull case I have to take seriously: if HLabs becomes the standard development kit for US robotics startups -- the way Arduino became the standard prototyping platform -- then the open-source strategy creates de facto standardization, and every robotics company that builds on HLabs firmware creates switching costs. Forty-plus companies ordering in four months is a real signal of developer pull. If the product line expands successfully, the integrated ecosystem becomes genuinely hard to replicate (no competitor offers US-made control boards + main boards + cameras + wireless designed to work together). Defense procurement, once you're in, creates multi-year sticky revenue. And the "picks and shovels" play in a robotics gold rush is historically how the real money gets made. That narrative can expand from "actuator boards" to "the domestic industrial supply chain for American robotics" -- which is a legitimately large story.

Ultimately, I see a company with strong AI-resistance characteristics and genuine physical-world moat potential, but insufficient non-consensus signal and meaningful execution risk from the solo-founder-with-wound-down-prior-company profile. The idea isn't weird enough, the founder isn't proven enough, and the tariff-dependent moat isn't structural enough for me to get truly excited. I'd watch this closely -- if Hetherington hires a manufacturing-focused co-founder, ships the full product line, and the tariff environment holds, this could become something. But right now I'm not writing a check.
