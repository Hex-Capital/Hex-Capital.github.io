## The Idea

**Problem:** Go-to-market (GTM) teams — sales reps, SDRs, and account executives — need to identify when target accounts are exhibiting buying signals (hiring for certain roles, making tech stack changes, publishing relevant blog posts, pushing code commits, announcing funding, etc.). Today this monitoring is done manually via LinkedIn, Twitter, Google Alerts, or through expensive enterprise intent-data vendors like 6sense ($50,000–$150,000+/year) and Bombora ($25,000–$75,000+/year) (Salesmotion, 2026 via search snippet). These enterprise platforms aggregate third-party cooperative intent data at the topic level, but often lack the real-time, granular, source-specific signals that smaller and mid-market teams need.

**Approach:** Autumn AI monitors public sources — social media posts, GitHub commits, blog posts, company announcements — in real time and surfaces buying signals the moment they appear. Users define their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and the specific signal types that matter to them, and the platform delivers a condensed, real-time feed filtered by intent. Notifications are delivered via email or Slack (YC company page). Example use cases include tracking startup incorporations, monitoring enterprise departments for signals, and prioritizing conference outreach (YC company page).

**Differentiation:** Compared to enterprise intent-data platforms (6sense, Bombora, Demandbase), Autumn AI focuses on first-party public web signals (posts, commits, blogs) rather than cooperative third-party browsing data. Compared to Clay ($204M raised, $3.1B valuation), which is a GTM development environment for data enrichment and workflow automation (TechCrunch, Aug 2025), Autumn AI focuses specifically on real-time signal detection rather than enrichment pipelines. Compared to Common Room (~$105M raised), which unifies community, product usage, and web signals into a "customer journey graph" (Common Room website), Autumn AI appears to target a narrower, more accessible entry point focused on public signal monitoring.

**Business Model:** No public pricing page was found on autumnai.com. The website features a "Book A Call" CTA linking to Calendly, suggesting a sales-led motion. [Inferred]: Most likely monetization path is a SaaS subscription model, potentially tiered by number of monitored accounts, signal sources, or seats, given the B2B GTM tooling category norms.

**TAM/SAM:** The global sales intelligence market was valued at approximately $4.5B in 2025 and is projected to reach approximately $10B by the early 2030s at an ~11.3% CAGR (Fortune Business Insights, 2025 via search snippet; Precedence Research, 2025 via search snippet). GTM intelligence platforms specifically grew at a 40% CAGR between 2023–2025 (Bloomberry via search snippet). No SAM estimate specific to the real-time signal monitoring sub-segment was found.

**GTM / Distribution:** The "Book A Call" CTA suggests a founder-led sales motion at this stage. The platform supports Slack and email notifications as delivery channels (autumnai.com). [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct outreach to SMB and mid-market sales teams, potentially leveraging the YC network for initial customers and expanding via product-led virality as SDRs share signal feeds within organizations.

## Defensibility

No defensibility signals found in public sources at this stage.

[Inferred]: Potential moat could develop via data network effects — as more users define ICPs and signal preferences, the platform could develop proprietary signal-scoring models that improve with usage. A signal index built across many public sources could create switching costs if users build workflows around it. However, this is unproven at this stage.

**Market structure:** The enterprise incumbents (6sense, Demandbase, ZoomInfo) are built on third-party cooperative intent data and sell at $25,000–$150,000+/year price points to enterprise ABM teams. Their business models depend on maintaining data cooperative relationships and serving large enterprise contracts. A lightweight, real-time public-signal monitoring tool at a lower price point may not be attractive for incumbents to pursue due to potential channel conflict with their existing high-ACV enterprise sales motion and cannibalization of premium intent data pricing. However, no structural barrier was identified that would prevent these incumbents from adding similar features as an up-market bundle.

**Commoditization risk:** The core capability — monitoring public web sources for changes and filtering by intent — is technically reproducible. Multiple startups (Unify, Common Room, Clay) already incorporate signal detection in their platforms. The barrier to entry for building a basic signal monitor is low; differentiation would depend on breadth of sources monitored, quality of signal filtering/scoring, and speed of delivery.

2. **Competitive landscape:**

   | Competitor | Funding | Revenue/ARR | Key Differentiator vs. Autumn AI |
   |-----------|---------|-------------|----------------------------------|
   | **Clay** | $204M raised, $3.1B valuation (TechCrunch, Aug 2025) | Expects $100M revenue (TechCrunch, Aug 2025) | Full GTM workflow automation and data enrichment platform; Autumn AI is narrower, focused on real-time signal detection |
   | **6sense** | $526M raised, $5.2B valuation (Sacra via search snippet) | >$200M ARR (Sacra via search snippet) | Enterprise predictive ABM with cooperative third-party intent data; Autumn AI monitors first-party public signals at potentially lower price point |
   | **Common Room** | ~$105M raised (Tracxn via search snippet) | $15M revenue as of June 2024 (Latka via search snippet) | Unifies community, product, and web signals into customer journey graph; Autumn AI focuses specifically on public web signal monitoring |
   | **Unify** | ~$59M raised, $260M valuation (BusinessWire, Jul 2025) | Revenue not disclosed; 8x YoY growth, 17% MoM growth (BusinessWire, Jul 2025) | Signal-based warm outbound with 25+ signal types plus built-in sequencing; Autumn AI focuses on the signal detection layer |
   | **ZoomInfo** | Publicly traded | Multi-billion revenue | Comprehensive B2B data platform with Streaming Intent; Autumn AI targets a lighter-weight, real-time alternative |

3. **Why now:** [Inferred]: Several catalysts appear relevant: (a) the rapid expansion of public digital signals as companies and individuals increase their online footprint via social media, GitHub, blogs, and corporate announcements; (b) LLM capabilities enabling automated parsing, summarization, and intent classification of unstructured web content at a cost and quality threshold that was not feasible before 2023–2024; (c) GTM teams increasingly adopting "signal-based selling" workflows, a term popularized by Common Room and others in 2024–2025, creating a recognized category and buyer demand.

His ML engineering background at Modulus provides relevant technical experience for building AI-powered signal processing. Shiv's AI research credentials (SandboxAQ, NeurIPS) and CS training provide the technical foundation for the platform's signal intelligence capabilities. YC Primary Partner is Ankit Gupta (YC company page).

## Key Risks

**Brand and domain confusion:** Multiple companies share the "Autumn" or "Autumn AI" name: a separate YC S25 company called "Autumn" (Stripe billing for AI startups) operates at useautumn.com; a prior "Autumn AI" based in Germany occupied the autumnai.com domain for an open-source ML framework (LinkedIn); and another "Autumn AI" based in Toronto was acquired by Qualtrics in March 2023 for employee wellbeing (Crunchbase via search snippet). This creates SEO competition and potential buyer confusion.

**Well-funded competitive convergence:** Clay ($204M raised), Unify ($59M raised), Common Room ($105M raised), and 6sense ($526M raised) are all building or have built signal detection as part of broader GTM platforms. These companies have the resources and existing customer bases to add real-time public-signal monitoring features, potentially commoditizing Autumn AI's core offering.

**Narrow product surface area:** The current product focuses on signal detection and feed delivery. Competitors like Clay and Unify bundle signal detection with enrichment, sequencing, and outreach execution. Autumn AI may face pressure to expand its feature set to retain customers who want an end-to-end workflow, which would stretch the two-person team.

**Founder availability timing:** Both founders appear to be current Columbia University students (Shiv's expected graduation is 2026 per LinkedIn). Running a startup full-time while completing undergraduate studies could constrain execution capacity.
