# ZeroSettle -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about ZeroSettle is that this is not a problem hiding in plain sight. It's a problem standing in broad daylight with a spotlight on it. The App Store's 30% commission has been the subject of the most publicized antitrust lawsuit in tech history, EU legislation, congressional hearings, and thousands of developer blog posts. Epic spent hundreds of millions of dollars litigating it. Every iOS developer on earth knows about this problem. That's the opposite of schlep blindness. When the problem is this visible and the regulatory door just opened, the question isn't "why didn't someone do this already?" -- it's "how many well-funded companies are already doing it?" The answer, unfortunately, is quite a few: Paddle and RevenueCat announced their joint solution in June 2025, Appcharge has raised $89 million and processes $500 million annually, Neon has $14 million from Thrive and a16z, and Stripe is providing raw infrastructure. This is a race, not a discovery.

The origin of this idea concerns me. Both founders are ex-Apple systems software engineers -- battery life, thermals, operating systems. That's impressive work, but it's platform-side engineering, not the experience of being an indie developer watching 30% of your revenue disappear every month. The domain knowledge is real: understanding StoreKit internals, Apple's review guidelines, and iOS platform architecture from the inside is genuinely valuable for building a compliant SDK. But knowing how a lock works is different from having been locked out. I don't see evidence that these founders were personally bleeding from the App Store tax. The more likely story is that they watched the Epic v. Apple ruling land in April 2025, recognized the opportunity through their Apple-insider lens, and built toward the newly opened market. That's a smart, timely bet. But it's the kind of idea that emerges from reading the news carefully, not from lived frustration.

The strongest thing ZeroSettle has going for it is the technical founder fit. Two ex-Apple systems engineers building iOS SDKs is about as precise a match between builder and product as you'll find at pre-seed. Ryan Elliott has a patent from Apple. They've shipped four public repos across Swift, React Native, Flutter, and whatever the escrow kit is -- 65 commits, 16 releases on the main SDK. They clearly build. If I were scoring solely on "can these founders make this specific product," they'd score near the top. This is where I'd compare them to the early days of Stripe -- the Collisons' technical ability was the reason they could tackle payment infrastructure that others couldn't. But the Collisons also had a different relationship to the problem. They were personally trying to accept payments online and couldn't believe how hard it was. That organic frustration drove them through years of bank negotiations and regulatory compliance. I worry that ZeroSettle's founders are building a technically excellent product toward a market window rather than toward a personal itch they can't stop scratching.

For the bull case to work, you'd need to believe three things simultaneously. First, the regulatory landscape remains favorable -- that courts don't let Apple claw back meaningful commissions on external transactions. Second, that developer adoption happens fast enough for a 2-person team to build market position before Paddle, RevenueCat, and Appcharge lock it down. Third, that the integrated single-SDK approach (versus Paddle + RevenueCat requiring two vendor integrations) creates enough switching cost to hold developers once larger competitors match the feature. Each of these is plausible. All three together starts to look like multiple miracles. The December 2025 appeals court ruling that Apple should be able to charge a "reasonable commission" on external purchases is particularly worrying -- if "reasonable" lands anywhere near 20%, the savings proposition narrows dramatically, and developers won't bother migrating off StoreKit for marginal savings through an unproven vendor.

The Merchant of Record schlep is real but not unique. Handling tax compliance across 190 countries, chargebacks, fraud -- that's genuine operational complexity. But Paddle has been doing exactly this for years. FastSpring does it. Lemon Squeezy does it. The schlep of MoR is well-mapped territory. What's new is applying it to iOS alternative billing specifically, but that's a feature extension for existing MoR companies, not a category-creating insight. Meanwhile, the "Founding Partner Program" offering free access for two years means ZeroSettle is deliberately delaying revenue from its earliest customers -- the opposite of getting to ramen profitable. At a time when you're racing against companies with hundreds of millions in funding, giving away your product for two years feels like bringing a knife to a gunfight and then offering to sharpen everyone else's swords first.

I keep coming back to the competitive dynamics. One of my strongest avoidance patterns is companies in hot, crowded categories where the idea is consensus. The iOS alternative billing market in 2025-2026 is exactly that. The regulatory door opened, and a dozen well-funded companies sprinted through it simultaneously. ZeroSettle may build the best SDK, but with 8 GitHub stars and no visible user traction against competitors already processing hundreds of millions in transactions, the window for a 2-person team to establish a defensible position is narrow. The technical founders are genuinely strong. The idea is genuinely not theirs to own.
