# Forum -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Forum is the competitive landscape, and it tells me almost everything I need to know about where this market sits. Noise.xyz raised $7.1M from Paradigm. Polymarket -- with $200M+ in funding and $21.5B in 2025 trading volume -- announced attention market contracts via Kaito launching March 2026. Zora shipped attention markets on Solana in mid-February 2026. When three well-capitalized teams all launch the same category of product within a few months of each other, you're not looking at a non-obvious market. You're looking at a consensus bet. My best investments -- PagerDuty, Gusto, Coinbase at the early stages -- were all in markets that triggered dismissive reactions from other investors. "Operations alerting? Boring." "Payroll for SMBs? Commoditized." "Crypto exchange? Speculative nonsense." Nobody is dismissing attention trading right now. Everybody is funding it. That's the opposite of the signal I look for.

The regulated exchange angle is the strongest structural argument here, and I want to engage with it seriously because regulatory moats are something I genuinely value. I backed Coinbase when financial regulation scared away most software investors. I backed Anduril when ITAR compliance created a structural vacancy. So Forum's thesis -- that a CFTC-registered Designated Contract Market for attention indices would create a barrier crypto-native competitors can't replicate -- is the right kind of thinking. The January 2026 CFTC announcement from Chairman Selig, signaling a more permissive stance on event contracts, is a legitimate structural moment. But there's a critical difference between Forum's position and Coinbase's in 2012: Coinbase had no well-capitalized regulated competitor in crypto exchange infrastructure. Forum faces Kalshi, which already holds DCM status, has $1.7B in total funding, generates $260M in annual revenue, and could add continuous attention-based contracts with incremental effort. Kalshi's current focus on sports betting doesn't make attention contracts structurally incompatible with their platform -- it makes them a roadmap expansion. The regulatory moat theory works when you're building the first regulated infrastructure in a category. It's much weaker when an incumbent already holds the regulatory credential you're pursuing.

This plan requires multiple miracles, and that's where I fundamentally struggle. Forum needs to: (1) obtain CFTC DCM designation -- a process that took Kalshi years and millions in legal costs; (2) build attention indices resistant to manipulation from bots, coordinated social media campaigns, and SEO gaming, using publicly available data sources; (3) bootstrap exchange liquidity from zero against competitors who already have live users and trading volume; and (4) prove that continuous attention indices are something people will trade with real money at scale, which remains entirely unvalidated. Each of these is a low-probability achievement individually. Together they compound into territory I explicitly avoid. When a founder tells me their one miracle is obtaining regulatory approval, that's interesting. When the actual execution path requires four sequential breakthroughs, it's a different conversation entirely.

The bull case would require believing that attention trading follows the prediction market adoption curve -- which genuinely exploded from $15B to $60B in trading volume during 2025 -- and that the regulated U.S. path is the only version that unlocks institutional capital and mainstream retail participation. If that's true, and if crypto-native platforms like Noise and Zora get blocked from U.S. retail users by regulatory enforcement, Forum could become the Coinbase equivalent: the boring, compliant version that captures the real market while the crypto experiments get shut down or stay niche. Owen Botkin's Balyasny background gives him legitimate market microstructure expertise, and the finance-plus-engineering co-founder combination covers the two core competencies. If the CFTC moves quickly, if Kalshi stays focused on sports, and if attention as an asset class proves to be more than a crypto speculation toy, there's a path. But that's a lot of "ifs" strung together, and I don't invest in chains of conditional probabilities.

The product-to-distribution question is theoretically interesting -- exchanges can expand across contract types, proprietary indices can be licensed, and exchange infrastructure naturally distributes additional products through the same regulatory and liquidity infrastructure. That's the CME model: start with one category, expand to many. But at two people, pre-revenue, with a placeholder website and simulated-currency-only product, there's no evidence of execution velocity or distribution thinking. I can't evaluate a distribution trajectory when there's nothing shipped to distribute. The underlying data sources for Forum's attention indices -- Google Trends, social media APIs, streaming metrics -- are publicly available, which means the indices themselves don't constitute a durable data moat unless they become standard benchmarks over time, analogous to S&P indices. That outcome is possible but requires the kind of market dominance that's extremely difficult to achieve when you're the smallest player in a category with Paradigm-backed and Founders Fund-backed competitors already live.

I'm passing. The market is consensus, not non-obvious. The plan requires multiple miracles. The competitive landscape is brutal for a two-person pre-seed team. Owen's finance background is relevant and the regulatory moat thesis shows structural thinking, but the gap between where Forum is today and where it needs to be is too wide, with too many well-funded competitors already further along the path.
