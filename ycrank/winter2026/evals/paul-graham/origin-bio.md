# Origin -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Origin is the trajectory from NFT marketplace to gene therapy AI. Yash Rathod founded Diginoor, "India's first NFT marketplace," during the peak of the NFT cycle, raised a million dollars, and sold it. Now he's building an AI model for regulatory DNA design in cell and gene therapies. Malhar Bhide has a somewhat more coherent thread — disease modeling research published in Nature Scientific Reports while in high school, healthcare ML work at Wadhwani AI, a grant for schizophrenia detection. But regulatory genomics is a very specific subfield, and neither founder appears to have been working inside a gene therapy lab, frustrated with the limited toolkit of natural promoters and brute-force screening. When I ask my first question — how did they find this problem? — the answer seems to be that two talented ML engineers at UIUC identified an opportunity where AI could be applied to an important biological problem, recruited heavyweight advisors (Kellis at MIT/Broad, Paulk at UCSF), and built a model. That's not organic discovery. That's the startup idea machine.

The schlep here is real, and it's actually what concerns me most. Designing synthetic regulatory DNA elements that work in actual cell therapies requires navigating an enormous validation gap: in silico predictions must be confirmed through wet-lab experiments, then animal models, then clinical trials conducted by pharma partners over many years. The founders claim Axis "outperforms Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome at predicting regulatory element activity," but this hasn't been independently verified, and there's no published wet-lab experimental data. The hard part of this problem isn't building a better ML model — it's proving that your computationally designed sequences actually control gene expression with the specificity and safety you predicted. The founders appear to be staying on the computational side of the schlep rather than walking into the biological one. That's a pattern I've seen before: founders who tackle the part of the problem they already know how to solve while outsourcing the part that actually matters to advisors and future partners.

I want to be fair about the bull case, because there is one. If Origin's model genuinely produces regulatory elements that outperform what exists — not just computationally but experimentally — this becomes a genuine enabling technology for a $55 billion market. The narrow focus on regulatory DNA, rather than trying to be a full-stack synthetic biology platform like Asimov, is the kind of "start with a contained fire" approach I usually like. The advisory board is strong enough to provide real scientific validation infrastructure. And Malhar's biomedical thread, while thin, is not zero. There's a version of this story where two young ML researchers happen to be the right people at the right moment because transformer architectures finally made de novo regulatory element design feasible, and their lack of biology orthodoxy lets them approach the problem without the assumptions that constrain academic groups. That's a real possibility. But it requires the model performance claims to hold up under wet-lab scrutiny, and right now that's unverified.

These are clearly capable young people. Yash's prior exit — however small and however much it followed the NFT trend — demonstrates he can build something, raise money, and sell. Malhar publishing in Nature Scientific Reports in high school is genuinely unusual. They're technical, they can code, they've built a working system. The question isn't whether they're talented; it's whether this specific problem chose them or they chose it. When Drew Houston built Dropbox, the idea emerged because he kept forgetting his USB drive — the problem was already living inside him. When the Collisons built Stripe, they'd been writing code and hitting the payment processing wall for years. I don't see that kind of founder-problem entanglement here. I see smart engineers who correctly identified that AI + gene therapy is an important frontier and applied their skills to it. That's admirable, but it's a different kind of motivation, and in my experience it produces a different level of persistence when things get hard — which in biotech, they always do.

The competitive landscape amplifies my concern. Asimov has raised $205 million and already offers tissue-specific promoter design. Dyno Therapeutics has $109 million and Roche partnerships. Academic groups are publishing open-source models for exactly this capability. Origin's moat depends on building a proprietary dataset of experimentally validated sequences that nobody else has — but they haven't demonstrated experimental validation yet. They're in a race against well-funded competitors and academic labs, and their primary asset is an unverified computational benchmark. At pre-seed I don't expect revenue, but I do expect evidence that at least one pharma team has looked at what they've built and said "we need this." The dossier shows "seeking partnerships" — they're looking, not finding.

I'll pass. The founders are talented and the problem matters, but the idea origin reads as manufactured rather than discovered, and the hardest part of the schlep — wet-lab validation and pharma adoption — remains entirely ahead of them with no evidence yet that it's achievable.
