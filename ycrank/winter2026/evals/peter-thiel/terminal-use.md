# Terminal Use -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The defining feature of Terminal Use is what I would call the Girardian signature of the entire agent infrastructure category. Count the competitors: E2B with $21 million raised and claims of 88% Fortune 100 sign-ups. Daytona with $31 million and $1 million ARR inside three months. Modal Labs at $1.1 billion valuation with $111 million in capital. Blaxel with First Round Capital backing. And then Vercel itself -- the company Terminal Use explicitly names in its own tagline -- expanding into agent hosting with Fluid compute and an established developer distribution channel that dwarfs anything a pre-seed startup can build. Five well-funded players, all converging on the same thesis: AI agents need purpose-built infrastructure. When I see five companies racing toward the same insight, I do not see an opportunity. I see the absence of a secret. The thesis that agents require different infrastructure than web applications is not contrarian -- it is the consensus view of every developer tools investor in San Francisco right now. And consensus, by definition, cannot create monopoly.

The tagline itself reveals the problem. "Vercel for background agents" is a 1-to-n formulation. It takes an existing category -- Vercel for web deployment -- and transposes it to a new domain. The next Vercel will not be built by copying Vercel's model for a different workload type, just as the next Google was not built by making a better search engine. When a company defines itself as "X for Y," it has already conceded that the fundamental insight belongs to someone else. The company is not creating a new category; it is entering an existing race. And entering a race where the original "X" -- Vercel -- is actively expanding into the exact "Y" you claim as your territory is particularly dangerous. You are not just competing with startups; you are competing with the company whose brand you have borrowed to explain your own existence.

I should note that these founders are from Palantir -- a company I co-founded and know intimately. I have enormous respect for the engineering culture there, and the specific credential that Vivek Raja led the technical delivery of one of the largest agent use cases across US hospitals is genuinely meaningful. These are not "men in suits." They understand production-grade agent deployment at a scale that most of their competitors do not. The shared history -- Edinburgh together, then Palantir together -- suggests the kind of deep relational trust that I have seen produce exceptional teams. If I were evaluating the team in isolation, I would be interested. But the PayPal Mafia succeeded not because the people were talented -- they were -- but because each one identified a genuinely new category to dominate. Reid Hoffman did not build a better job board; he created professional identity networking. Max Levchin did not build better lending; he created honest finance through Affirm. The Palantir pedigree here is being applied to a competitive infrastructure market rather than to a category-creating opportunity, and that is the fundamental mismatch.

The bull case requires you to believe three things simultaneously. First, that filesystem-heavy background agents represent the dominant paradigm for AI compute -- not stateless API-based architectures, not ephemeral sandboxes, but persistent filesystem-bound processes. Second, that an opinionated developer experience for this specific pattern creates sufficient switching costs to resist both well-funded startups and platform expansion from Vercel and the hyperscalers. Third, that Terminal Use can achieve critical adoption in this niche before the window closes -- before E2B's network effects, Daytona's traction, or Vercel's distribution make the category impenetrable. If all three are true, this could be the definitive platform for agent deployment, analogous to how Vercel became definitive for Next.js. But each of these beliefs is independently uncertain, and the conjunction is fragile. The filesystem-specific wedge is a legitimate architectural bet, but it is also a bet that the agent ecosystem evolves in one particular direction -- and if coding agents move toward stateless or ephemeral patterns, the core value proposition narrows to irrelevance. I have seen too many infrastructure companies tie their thesis to a specific architectural moment that the industry outgrows.

The technology itself does not clear my threshold. Container orchestration, filesystem isolation, CLI tooling -- these are described even in the company's own framing as well-understood infrastructure patterns. The differentiation is in the "opinionated combination" and lifecycle integration, which is execution, not invention. Execution advantages are real but they are not proprietary technology in any structural sense. A well-resourced competitor -- and several exist -- can replicate an opinionated CLI and lifecycle pipeline. The GitHub organization has three repositories with zero to one stars, which at pre-seed is not damning in itself, but it means there is no open-source community flywheel, no organic developer enthusiasm creating a moat. Compare this to Stripe, which created a developer-first payments API that was an order of magnitude simpler than anything available -- developers experienced the 10x improvement the first time they wrote seven lines of code instead of seven hundred. I see no evidence of that kind of discontinuity here.

I pass. The founders have the right background and the right instincts about where technology is heading, but they have entered a market that violates the most fundamental principle of my investment framework: they are competing, and competition destroys value. A market with five well-funded players sharing the same thesis has no secret left to exploit, no monopoly path to walk, and no power-law outcome to justify the risk.
