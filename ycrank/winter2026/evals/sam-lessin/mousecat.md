# MouseCat -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Sardine raised $70 million in February 2025 and announced — in their press release, not in some quiet product roadmap — "a suite of intelligent agents designed to streamline fraud and compliance operations." That is, word for word, what MouseCat is building. And Sardine isn't some distant incumbent: they're listed on MouseCat's own website as an *integration partner*. One of the data sources MouseCat depends on for its investigation workflows is simultaneously its best-funded, most directly overlapping competitor, with 100+ customers already deployed. When your integration partner is also your existential threat, you don't have a strategic position — you have a dependency masquerading as a partnership.

The founders, I'll say clearly, are the right people for this exact problem. Nicholas Aldridge spent 6.5 years as a principal engineer at AWS AI, where he built the literal infrastructure — Bedrock Agents, Knowledge Bases, AgentCore — that powers agentic AI workflows everywhere. He's described as a core maintainer of MCP. Joseph McAllister spent four years at Coinbase building ML models for ATO and ACH fraud, then has a prior exit with Roo Storage. If you were casting the ideal two-person team to build AI-powered fraud investigation tools, you'd cast these two. The "sane" part of my framework is fully satisfied — these are credentialed operators with verifiable, directly relevant experience. The problem is that the idea isn't remotely insane. "AI agents for fraud investigation" is the single most obvious application of LLM-powered agentic workflows in all of fintech. Every incumbent with a competent ML team is building toward this. When the idea is this consensus, founder quality gets you a head start measured in months, not years.

This company fails my most important structural test: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. Without AI, there is no MouseCat — the entire value proposition is AI orchestration of investigation workflows. That's the opposite of "cherry on top." The AI isn't enhancing an already-defensible business; it IS the business. And when AI is the business, you're competing against every platform that has distribution and can bolt on equivalent AI capabilities. Sardine, Sift, DataVisor, Unit21 — they all have customers, data, and engineering teams. MouseCat's investigation-to-production-rule pipeline is genuinely clever, but it's a workflow innovation, not a structural moat. The dossier itself notes that "no single component appears uniquely defensible," and the on-premises deployment model — while necessary for enterprise compliance — actively prevents MouseCat from building cross-customer data network effects that could create compounding advantages over time.

The architectural position here is application layer through and through. MouseCat sits on top of other people's primitives at every level: LLMs provide the intelligence, Middesk and Socure and LexisNexis provide the data signals, Databricks and Snowflake provide the data infrastructure, and the customer's own rule engine provides the deployment target. MouseCat is orchestrating an ecosystem of existing tools. That's valuable work, but it's not creating a new primitive. No one is going to build their product on top of MouseCat the way developers build on Solana or businesses build on Venmo's payment rails. The compounding network dynamics I look for in my best investments simply aren't present here.

If I force myself to construct the bull case: the investigation-to-production-rule pipeline is a genuine workflow gap. Incumbents focus on real-time scoring and transaction decisioning. The analyst workflow — investigating fraud cases, synthesizing signals from multiple vendors, generating hypotheses, backtesting rules, deploying to production — is genuinely manual and painful. If MouseCat can land a few enterprise customers before Sardine ships its agent suite, the switching costs from embedded production rules could create real lock-in. The "2nd highest-rated company of the YC product showcase" suggests the demo converts. And enterprise fraud teams are desperate — fraud losses exceeded $1 trillion globally in 2025. The founders' specific credibility could compress enterprise sales cycles that would be impossible for a less credentialed team. For this to work, MouseCat needs to be in production at three to five enterprise customers within the next twelve months, generating enough embedded switching costs that Sardine's inevitable feature launch becomes irrelevant. That's a narrow window, and two people have to thread it while simultaneously building product.

I keep returning to the structural logic. I'd rather fund a company that uses AI to make a painting business 30% more efficient than a company whose entire existence depends on AI remaining a difficult capability to deploy. Software is a business tool, not a business model — and MouseCat is a software business through and through, in a market where the biggest players have already announced they're building the same software.
