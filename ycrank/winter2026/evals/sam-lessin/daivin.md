# DAIVIN! -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The most interesting thing about DAIVIN! is that it's attempting to do something that literally nobody has done before -- replace a century of pressurized gas diving with on-demand electrolysis that splits seawater into breathable oxygen. That's not an incremental improvement. That's not an AI wrapper. That's a physics bet. And my first instinct when I see a physics bet is to check whether the person making it has any business making it, because the distance between "insane idea from a sane person" and "insane idea from someone who doesn't understand why it hasn't been done" is the entire difference between Coinbase and a science fair project.

Leo Kankkunen has a genuine claim to the "sane" side of the equation -- youngest person in Finland to earn the highest national electrical certification, seven years in the electrical industry, M.Sc. in engineering, military veteran, certified diver. He frames oxygen supply as "fundamentally an energy problem," which is exactly the kind of reframing I gravitate toward -- it's the conceptual move that turns a logistics business into a technology primitive. But here's where my calibration gets cautious: the problem isn't just electrical engineering. It's electrochemistry at extreme pressures, membrane science, gas dynamics, hydrogen safety management, and life-support system certification -- simultaneously. A solo founder spanning all of those disciplines at pre-seed is a bet I've seen go wrong more often than right. The "sane" credential is real but narrower than the challenge demands.

Where DAIVIN! lights up my framework is on AI resistance. This is maximally un-commoditizable by software. AI cannot generate oxygen molecules underwater. No LLM integration, no incumbent feature launch, no SaaS competitor can replicate what this company is building. This is the extreme expression of my thesis that the best investments are in businesses where the moat lives in atoms, not bits -- Craftwork paints houses, Metropolis installs parking hardware, and DAIVIN! electrolyzes water. The operational complexity and safety engineering required to build life-support equipment is exactly the kind of "ugly" barrier that keeps software-native competitors out. If I'm looking for businesses that get stronger as AI makes software cheaper, a portable electrolyzer vest is about as far from the blast radius of model commoditization as you can get.

The narrative elasticity here is genuinely compelling -- "Sea, Land & Space" isn't just marketing copy, it's a credible expansion story. If portable electrolysis-based breathing works underwater at 200 meters, the same primitive applies to firefighting, mining, hazmat, submarine operations, and eventually aerospace life support. Each new environment is a legitimate narrative expansion, not a pivot. Defense procurement alone -- if you can provide special operations divers with untethered deep-water breathing -- could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity. The "infinity story" is real: breath autonomy as a platform technology for human operation in hostile environments has a theoretically unlimited ceiling.

But I've been burned by this exact pattern before. MakerBot's vision of "democratized manufacturing" sounded like a new manufacturing primitive -- it was actually a consumer hardware product with no network effects and limited compounding dynamics. The question I have to ask about DAIVIN! is whether "breath autonomy" is a genuine new primitive that other products and applications build on, or whether it's a hardware product that will always be sold one unit at a time. There's no network effect in electrolysis. There's no data flywheel. Every vest sold doesn't make the next vest more valuable. The company creates a product, not a protocol -- and my largest returns (Solana, Venmo, Helium) have all come from investments that established layers other people build on top of. DAIVIN! might be a fantastic hardware company. But "fantastic hardware company" and "venture-scale compounder" are different categories.

The technical risk here is the elephant in the room. Generating sufficient oxygen flow rate for human respiration at 200 meters via portable electrolysis -- while safely venting hydrogen gas near an oxygen-breathing diver -- is an extraordinary engineering claim. No third-party testing, no certifications, no independent validation. The regulatory pathway for novel life-support equipment has no precedent for electrolysis-based systems, which means custom certification that could take years. And there's zero revenue, zero customers, zero LOIs -- the entire investment case rests on the founder's technical conviction and a prototype whose performance characteristics are unverified publicly. At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of traction, but I do note that a single defense LOI or a validated depth test would dramatically change my conviction level.

The bull case is real and I want to be honest about it: if Leo Kankkunen can actually deliver a working electrolysis breathing system at depth, he's sitting on a genuine category-creating technology with defense applications that could generate enormous revenue before recreational markets even open. The "why now" -- battery density improvements, PEM cost declines, helium price spikes -- is structurally sound, not just narrative convenience. And the fact that every other VC will dismiss this as physically implausible is exactly the market condition that produces my best returns. Helium took seven years from seed to unicorn and most VCs wrote it off the entire time. If I imagine a world where DAIVIN! actually works, the returns are asymmetric in exactly the way seed investing should be. But unlike Helium, which had deployed hardware generating real network data within a few years, DAIVIN! faces a validation timeline that could consume enormous capital before producing any signal. I'd want to see a verified depth test and at least preliminary engagement with a defense buyer before committing capital. Today, it's a compelling thesis attached to an unproven physics bet from a solo founder -- which keeps me in "watching closely" territory rather than "writing a check."
