# Tepali -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Boulevard raised $80M in July 2025 explicitly to push into medspas with AI features. Zenoti has $331M and $174M in revenue serving enterprise wellness. AestheticsPro is an established medspa-specific incumbent. This is not a market where a 2-person pre-launch team is arriving with a non-consensus insight -- this is a market where the consensus has already formed, the capital has already arrived, and the pricing already reflects the optimism. When TechCrunch is writing about "the Botox and GLP-1 surge" as a demand driver in the context of an $80M Series D, the window for being right first has closed. You're competing for being right better, which is a different and much harder game for a pre-seed company with no customers.

The specific knowledge question is where this falls apart for me. Chrisvin Jabamani has a strong generalist profile -- NYU Stern, PJT Partners investment banking, ops at Rilla. The Rilla experience is the most relevant signal because it exposed him to selling AI vertical SaaS into fragmented SMB markets. But that's transferable operational knowledge -- the kind of pattern recognition you get from working at one vertical SaaS company and applying it to another. What I don't see is anyone on this team who has run a medspa, worked in a medspa, treated patients in a medspa, or spent years obsessing over the specific operational dysfunction of medical aesthetics businesses. The second co-founder, Vishnu Pathmanaban, is essentially invisible in public sources -- no LinkedIn profile I can evaluate, no GitHub, no background data. For a 2-person team, having zero readable signal on 50% of the founding team is a problem. I cannot assess what non-teachable knowledge this team possesses about their domain, because the evidence suggests the domain was selected rather than lived.

The architecture here is vertical SaaS consolidation -- six existing software categories (scheduling, CRM, charting, inventory, marketing analytics, payroll) combined into one platform with an AI query layer on top. This is not leverage creation. This is bundling. The individual components are well-understood, the AI layer is an LLM interface that is becoming table stakes across every vertical, and the core value proposition -- "one tool instead of six" -- is the same pitch every vertical SaaS company makes. Each new medspa customer requires founder-led sales, onboarding, data migration, and HIPAA compliance support. Revenue scales linearly with sales effort. There is no marketplace dynamic, no network effect, no protocol that makes the hundredth customer qualitatively different from the first. The dossier infers potential data network effects from aggregated marketing performance benchmarks, but that requires scale Tepali hasn't achieved and may never achieve against funded incumbents.

The strongest bull case would require several things to be true simultaneously: that AestheticsPro is technically dated enough to lose customers to a modern alternative, that Boulevard's expansion into medspas from premium salons creates a gap in the mid-market, that HIPAA compliance requirements are high enough to deter casual entrants but manageable enough for a 2-person team, and that closed-loop marketing attribution (ad spend to patient LTV) is genuinely differentiated enough to win deals. If all of those hold, Tepali could build a $20-50M ARR business serving independent medspa operators. That's a reasonable outcome -- but it's a 3-5x return in a good scenario, not the asymmetric upside I need from a pre-seed check. The HIPAA compliance burden alone is a significant ongoing cost for two people. And the naming confusion -- the email domain is uselotus.ai, the GitHub repo is lotus-mcp, but the product is Tepali -- suggests the company is still in the identity-formation stage of its existence.

I keep coming back to my test: what does this founder know that can't be taught? I see a smart, energetic person who identified a market gap through research and professional pattern-matching. That's a fine way to start a company. But it's not the signal I invest behind. The medspas-are-underserved insight is available to anyone who spends a month talking to medspa owners. The "AI-native" positioning is available to anyone who has used an LLM API. The consolidation thesis is the default playbook. None of this is wrong -- it's just not proprietary. And in a market where Boulevard is spending $80M to build the same thing, proprietary knowledge is the only advantage that matters.
