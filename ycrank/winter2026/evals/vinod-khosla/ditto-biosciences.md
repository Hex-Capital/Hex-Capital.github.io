# Ditto Biosciences -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Nature has been running the largest drug discovery program in history for a billion years, and nobody thought to check the results. That's the core insight here, and it's genuinely compelling. Parasites -- viruses, ticks, helminths -- have evolved proteins exquisitely tuned to manipulate the human immune system. They had to, or they'd be destroyed by the host. Ditto Bio is proposing to systematically mine this evolutionary library using computational genomics and turn what parasites learned about us into therapeutics for autoimmune disease. The pharma establishment designs molecules from scratch, spending $15-20 million and 3-5 years on pre-clinical work alone, when evolution has already optimized millions of immunomodulatory proteins through natural selection. That's the kind of fundamental reframing I pay attention to -- not incremental improvement, but a categorically different source of drug candidates.

But here's where I need to be honest about what success actually looks like. If Ditto Bio's platform works perfectly -- if parasite-derived proteins produce superior autoimmune therapeutics with fewer side effects -- the result is better drugs sold through the same pharma distribution system, prescribed by the same doctors, approved through the same FDA pathways. The autoimmune market is enormous, $80-116 billion depending on who's counting, and the current standard of care -- broad immunosuppression -- is genuinely terrible for patients. Making that better matters. But it doesn't make the incumbent system obsolete. Merck, Pfizer, Regeneron -- they don't get displaced by this approach. They acquire it. Pandion Therapeutics proved this exactly: novel protein therapeutics for autoimmune disease, acquired by Merck for $1.9 billion. That's a very good outcome for investors but it's a transaction within the existing order, not a transformation of it. The consequence of success here is a multibillion-dollar acquisition or a specialty biotech company, not a fundamental restructuring of how medicine works.

The team is scientifically impeccable and that's both the strength and the concern. Three PhDs from UCSF, Berkeley, and UCSD. Fifty-plus publications. A Miller Fellowship. An NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. An anti-CRISPR patent. Three years of prior collaboration at Arcadia Science, which was explicitly focused on non-model organism biology -- the exact intellectual precursor to mining parasites for therapeutics. This is about as deep a founder-market fit as you'll find in biotech. But they're insiders to their own field, not outsiders bringing irreverent naivety to an industry that needs disruption. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, the aerospace establishment couldn't imagine a New Zealander with no pedigree building launch vehicles. When I backed Pat Brown at Impossible Foods, the food industry laughed at a biochemist making burgers. Ditto's founders aren't making anyone laugh -- parasitologists mining parasites for immunomodulatory proteins is exactly what you'd expect parasitologists to do. It's brilliant science applied through the standard biotech playbook. What's missing is someone on this team who has navigated an IND filing, structured a pharma licensing deal, or raised a $100 million Series B -- all of which are on the critical path for a company that needs hundreds of millions to reach the clinic.

The timing argument is the strongest bull case. AlphaFold and the computational genomics revolution have made it possible to screen a million parasite proteins for therapeutic potential -- a task that was prohibitively expensive even five years ago. The academic literature on helminth-derived immunomodulation has been building (eBioMedicine/The Lancet, 2023), providing scientific grounding. Over 98% of viral and parasite proteins remain uncharacterized, which means Ditto is genuinely at the leading edge of an exponential screening capability. They've already found candidates with 1-2 nanomolar binding affinities, which is legitimately strong. If the computational tools keep improving at their current rate, the cost to screen and characterize new candidates drops every quarter. That's the rate-of-change signal I track. The question is whether this timing advantage translates into durable competitive advantage or whether well-funded competitors -- Seismic ($222M), Anokion ($225M), Sonoma ($335M) -- absorb the same computational tools and arrive at the same evolutionary biology insight with 500x more capital.

What I keep circling back to is the gap between the profundity of the biological insight and the constraints of the business model that delivers it. Drug development is the most capital-intensive, time-intensive, and failure-prone business model in technology. A $500K pre-seed is essentially a research grant in biotech -- you can screen proteins and publish papers, but you're a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars from a commercial product. The tissue biobank for immunogenicity mapping is smart -- it addresses a real risk of parasite-derived proteins triggering immune rejection -- but building and validating that biobank requires resources far beyond what's currently available. I've seen this pattern before. The science is beautiful, the problem matters, the founders are capable. But the path from here to economic impact requires surviving a capital gauntlet that destroys most biotech companies, and it requires the technology to achieve not just biological activity but unit economics that justify displacing established therapies. KiOR taught me that technology achievement without economic viability is a trap. The binding affinities are promising; the question is whether the full development cost of a parasite-derived biologic ultimately produces a therapy that payers will cover at a price that justifies the R&D.

I respect the ambition and I respect the insight. Evolution as a drug discovery platform is the kind of reframing that could matter enormously. But at this stage, with this team composition, this capital requirement, and this competitive landscape, the probability-adjusted path to a transformational outcome doesn't clear my bar. The consequence of success is important but bounded -- better drugs, not a new system. The founders are experts, not outsiders. The business model requires a capital stack they don't have and can't easily acquire against competitors with $200M+ head starts. I'd want to see evidence that the platform can be monetized short of full clinical development -- perhaps through pharma partnerships or licensing of the protein database itself -- before committing capital. The science deserves funding; the venture structure doesn't yet match the ambition.
