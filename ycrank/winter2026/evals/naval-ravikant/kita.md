# Kita -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing that catches my attention is the infrastructure architecture. Kita isn't a lender -- it's the tooling layer that lenders plug into. That's a picks-and-shovels play, and my portfolio tells you I systematically back those: Alchemy for blockchain developers, Stack Overflow for developer knowledge, AngelList for funding infrastructure. When you build the infrastructure layer, you don't need to pick the winning lender -- you win when any of them win. Kita processing documents for every lending institution in the Philippines is structurally analogous to Alchemy processing transactions for every DeFi protocol. The question is whether the infrastructure is differentiated enough to hold its position.

On specific knowledge, the picture is mixed in a way that matters. Carmel Limcaoco grew up in Manila -- she knows the e-wallet landscape, the document formats, the cultural texture of Philippine financial life. That's geographic-cultural knowledge that a Stanford MBA parachuting into Manila wouldn't have. Real, but partial. She didn't spend a decade inside a Philippine lending institution watching underwriting decisions get made. Her professional experience is at Apple in audio and music product -- smart person, strong executor, but not someone whose career has been an obsessive deep-dive into credit risk in emerging markets. Rhea Malhotra is genuinely exceptional -- winning the Firestone Medal for best CS thesis at Stanford is a signal that's hard to fake, and her publications at ICRA, RSS, and Humanoids demonstrate first-rate computer vision research. But her specific knowledge lives in robotics and manipulation, not in document intelligence for lending. Applying VLMs to document extraction is a reasonable lateral move from her skill set, not the inevitable application of years of domain obsession. The specific knowledge here is the combination of "grew up in Manila" plus "world-class CV researcher" -- which is valuable but compositional rather than deep.

The leverage question is where I need to be precise. There's a difference between automation leverage and creation leverage. Uber didn't make existing taxi dispatch faster -- it turned every car owner into a potential driver, creating a new category of economic participant. Kita at its best doesn't just make credit analysts faster -- it makes lending feasible to the 50% of Filipinos who are currently unbanked because their financial history lives in unstructured e-wallet records that no human team could review at scale. If that's what's actually happening, the leverage ratio is transformative: one API call replaces hours of manual document review, and the output is a lending decision that couldn't have been made at all without the technology. The six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage suggests real pain, not speculative demand. But I need to be honest -- most of the value right now is automating existing manual processes for existing lenders, not enabling entirely new lending categories. The creation leverage is potential, not proven.

The contrarian timing dimension is where this evaluation softens. "AI for document processing" is about the most consensus application of language models you can name in 2026. Every enterprise AI pitch deck has a slide about unstructured-to-structured data transformation. The emerging-market geographic focus adds some non-consensus flavor -- most AI companies optimize for US and European markets first, and the specific document types in the Philippines and Indonesia are genuinely underserved. But the underlying technology bet -- VLMs can parse documents -- is shared by hundreds of companies. The real contrarian bet would be that emerging-market lending infrastructure is a bigger opportunity than developed-market lending infrastructure. That's potentially true and potentially underpriced, but it's not a truth that most smart people actively dismiss. It's more of a neglected truth than a contrarian one.

The strongest bull case: this is the Ocrolus of Southeast Asia, built by someone who grew up in the market, with a CTO who has genuinely elite computer vision credentials, and they've already got paying customers and 30% month-over-month growth. The feedback loop linking document signals to repayment outcomes is the right architecture for compounding -- each loan that gets repaid or defaults trains the model to better predict the next one. If they accumulate enough lending-outcome data across multiple markets before VLM commoditization erodes their extraction advantage, they could build a data moat that's genuinely defensible. The TAM is real -- trillions of dollars in emerging-market lending needs infrastructure. And the picks-and-shovels positioning means they don't need to pick winners among lenders. For this to be a great investment, VLM commoditization has to be slower than outcome-data accumulation, and the founders have to navigate multi-market regulatory complexity with a two-person team. Both are plausible but uncertain.

What holds me back from writing a check is the absence of the kind of specific knowledge that can't be taught. Carmel knows Manila, Rhea knows computer vision -- and together they're building document processing for Philippine lenders. It's a sensible intersection, not an inevitable one. Compare this to Amjad Masad at Replit, who had been building coding tools for years before starting the company, or the Stack Overflow founders who had been living inside developer knowledge exchange for a decade. The founder-problem bond here is constructed from complementary strengths rather than forged through obsessive domain immersion. Smart people solving a real problem -- but the specific knowledge test asks whether these particular founders know something about emerging-market lending that couldn't be replicated by another talented pair with similar credentials and six months of research. I'm not convinced the answer is yes.
