# MouseCat -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what catches my eye first, and it's not a good sign for how I invest: Sardine raised $70 million in February 2025 and announced -- in a press release -- that they're building "a suite of intelligent agents designed to streamline fraud and compliance operations." That's almost verbatim what MouseCat is building. Sift has $162 million and a billion-dollar valuation. DataVisor, Unit21, Flagright -- they're all in this orbit. When I look at a company, one of the first things I ask myself is whether it's unpopular, whether other investors think it's strange or impossible. MouseCat is the opposite of that. AI agents for fraud detection is a category that well-funded incumbents are already racing into. The fact that MouseCat was the "2nd highest-rated company at the YC product showcase" reinforces this -- it's popular, which in my experience means the pricing power and the surprise factor have already started to erode.

I never got to hear these founders' stories -- how they got here, what drives them, what broke them and rebuilt them. All I can see is professional credentials, and I'll be honest, the credentials are impressive. Nicholas Aldridge spent six and a half years as a Principal Engineer at AWS building the very AI agent infrastructure -- Bedrock Agents, AgentCore, Knowledge Bases -- that this company's technology stack rests on. He's described as a core maintainer of MCP. Joseph McAllister built fraud ML models at Coinbase for four years, specifically for account takeover and ACH risk, and he has a prior exit from Roo Storage. These two people have probably the most precise skill convergence you could design for this exact product. But that's a competence case, not a conviction case. When I backed Uber, it wasn't because Travis had an impressive resume in transportation logistics -- it was because I could feel the years of frustration he'd lived through, the gravitas that comes from trying to change something that personally offended you. I don't see what personally offends these founders about fraud investigation workflows. They worked at companies that dealt with fraud, and they're clearly talented at building AI systems. But "I was good at this at my last job" is a very different signal than "I can't sleep until this problem is solved."

The bull case is real, and I want to honor it: if you're a Paul Graham-style investor evaluating technical founder-market fit, this is close to ideal. Aldridge didn't just use AI agents -- he built the infrastructure layer that other companies' AI agents run on. McAllister didn't just study fraud -- he built the streaming systems and ML models that Coinbase used to detect it in real time. The specific insight that the investigation-to-production pipeline is a different layer than real-time scoring is genuinely interesting, and it's the kind of positioning that comes from having worked inside the problem deeply enough to see the gap. If MouseCat can land a few enterprise customers and embed their generated rules into production fraud stacks on Databricks and Snowflake, the switching costs could become meaningful. McAllister's prior exit, even a small acquisition, tells me he knows what it feels like to build something from nothing and navigate the emotional terrain of a startup. These are the founders that a16z would fund at pre-seed without blinking.

But I'm not a16z, and I'm investing my own money based on how I've learned to read the world. This company doesn't create economic access for anyone who currently lacks it. It makes fraud analysts at banks more efficient -- a worthy goal, but not one that gives a driver a new income stream or makes opaque credit terms transparent to a borrower. There's an indirect argument that better fraud detection protects consumers, but that's two steps removed from the kind of impact I feel in my bones when I evaluate a company. The integration dependency on Sardine -- listed as both partner and competitor -- is the kind of structural tension that can turn existential quickly when a $145 million incumbent decides you're in their lane. And the enterprise sales motion this product requires, with on-premises deployment and compliance audit trails, is a brutal path for a two-person team that isn't even hiring.

I also can't assess the one thing that's become non-negotiable for me since HQ Trivia: how these co-founders handle conflict. No shared employer, no shared university, no public data on how they met or what their dynamic looks like under pressure. That's not a red flag -- it's just a blank space where I need signal. At the earliest stages, when I'm writing a check before the data exists, the co-founder relationship is one of the few things I can actually evaluate. Here, I can't.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a crowded, consensus category. That's exactly the kind of bet I've trained myself not to make. The best investments I've ever written checks for -- SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe -- were the ones where everybody told me I was crazy. Nobody's going to tell you you're crazy for backing AI fraud tools in 2026.
