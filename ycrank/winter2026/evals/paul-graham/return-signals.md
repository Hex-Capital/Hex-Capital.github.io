# Return Signals -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Return Signals is that the technical founder's entire career has been in healthcare AI. Ilya Valmianski built SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente -- processing 25 million primary care encounters -- then built conversational patient intake at Curai, then founded MDandMe, an AI symptom checker that raised $2M in mid-2023. Somewhere between then and now, he landed on e-commerce returns. The capability is real. SmartTriage at Kaiser-scale is not resume padding; that's a production system handling nuanced, high-stakes conversations with millions of real patients. But when I ask my first question -- "How did they find this problem?" -- the answer appears to be: a talented conversational AI builder surveyed the landscape for a new domain to apply his skills. That's capability-first, not problem-first. And in my experience, the difference matters enormously over the years of painful execution required to win a market.

The e-commerce returns problem is real -- $850 billion in US returns, 15.8% of online sales -- and the proactive-versus-reactive distinction is genuinely interesting. Every incumbent in this space (Loop, Narvar, AfterShip) built reactive portals: the customer decides to return, then the software processes it. Return Signals contacts the customer before they've initiated a return and steers them toward an exchange. That's a different product. And there's a structural conflict that works in their favor: incumbents make money processing returns, so a tool that prevents returns from entering the pipeline could cannibalize their core revenue. That's the kind of business model moat that most people miss. But here's the thing -- this observation doesn't require lived experience with the returns problem. It requires reading about Loop's business model and recognizing the misalignment. The insight is clever. Clever is not the same as organic.

Neither founder has documented e-commerce or retail experience. Ilya's background is healthcare AI in San Francisco and San Diego. Alejandro's is business development at proptech companies (Nestpick, Blueground) in New York. There's no visible shared history between them -- no overlapping employer, university, or even city. This pattern -- co-founders from unrelated domains who connected specifically to start a company -- is one I've watched fail repeatedly. In one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they didn't know well, and all nine fell apart within a year. I don't know that's what happened here, but the absence of any backstory about their relationship is itself a data point.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If the 70% exchange conversion rate is real production data and not a demo mockup, that's extraordinary. If Ilya's skill at building empathetic conversational AI -- honed on millions of sensitive patient interactions -- transfers directly to the post-purchase moment of customer dissatisfaction, then Return Signals has a technical founder who has already solved the hardest version of this problem (health, where the stakes are life and death) and is now applying it to an easier version (retail, where the stakes are a pair of jeans). The conversational AI that can triage chest pain symptoms should be able to handle "these shoes don't fit." And the fact that they already have SOC 2 certification at pre-seed suggests operational seriousness. If the incumbents' business model truly conflicts with return prevention, and if this team can land a handful of mid-market DTC brands that see 5-10% margin improvement, the word-of-mouth could be rapid.

But I keep coming back to the origin. MDandMe raised $2M in June 2023 and appears to have been wound down or deprioritized before Return Signals emerged. When a founder's previous company in their domain of expertise (healthcare) doesn't work out, and their next company is in an entirely different domain (e-commerce), the question isn't whether they're smart enough to build it -- they clearly are. The question is whether they'll persist through the unglamorous years of learning a new industry's peculiarities. Drew Houston didn't need to learn the file storage industry because the problem grew from his own daily frustration. The Collison brothers didn't need to learn payment processing because they'd been building software that needed payments for years. Here, both founders need to learn e-commerce from scratch while simultaneously building and selling a product. The technical capability transfers. The domain knowledge doesn't. And the schlep in e-commerce returns -- while real -- is moderate. It's not Stripe-level regulatory complexity; it's Shopify integrations and SMS compliance. Any well-funded incumbent with an engineering team could add proactive outbound SMS as a feature in a quarter.

Ilya is a legitimate technical builder, and that's the company's clearest strength. A PhD physicist with 836 citations who shipped ML systems processing tens of millions of interactions at Kaiser -- that's not someone who outsources the hard work. But the strongest signal in my framework is the conjunction of organic problem discovery and genuine schlep willingness, and I don't see it here. This looks like a smart solution searching for its ideal problem rather than a painful problem that finally found its builder.
