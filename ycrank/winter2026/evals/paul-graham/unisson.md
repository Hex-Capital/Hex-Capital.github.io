# Unisson -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is that this is an "AI agent for X" company in one of the most crowded subcategories of the most crowded category in tech right now. Customer success platforms are racing to add AI. Gainsight acquired an AI company. ChurnZero launched AI agents. Vitally built a copilot. Coworker.ai raised $16.5 million for general-purpose enterprise agents. When I look at a space and count five funded competitors doing adjacent work, plus incumbents with tens of thousands of existing customers bolting on the same capability, that's the opposite of schlep blindness. That's consensus. The worst startup ideas aren't bad ideas -- they're ideas that are obviously good to everyone simultaneously, which means the returns have already been competed away before you start.

How did these founders find this problem? Varun built AI agent products at Ambient.ai. Tom built perception systems at Chef Robotics. Neither appears to have been a technical CSM, an implementation engineer, or a sales engineer. There's no visible moment where one of them was drowning in product questions at 2am trying to onboard an enterprise customer and thought "this is insane, there has to be a better way." The problem they're describing is real -- customer-facing teams do get bottlenecked by product knowledge -- but it reads like something identified through market mapping rather than personal frustration. When I ask "would these founders have built this if they hadn't decided to start a startup?" I can't answer yes. That's the test. Drew Houston built Dropbox because he kept forgetting his USB drive. The Collisons built Stripe because they were programmers who hated integrating payments. The organic connection between founder and problem is what sustains you through years of grinding execution. I don't see it here.

The strongest thing Unisson has going for it is the technical capability of the founding team. Varun didn't just dabble in AI -- he spent years at Ambient.ai progressing from software engineer to leading product, engineering, and VLM research for agent products at a company that raised over $72 million. Tom led the perception team at Chef Robotics managing production robot deployments, which means he knows what it takes to make AI systems work in the real world rather than in demos. Both founders have shipped production AI at serious companies. If I were evaluating purely on whether these two can build what they're describing, the answer is probably yes. The "learn any product in 15-20 minutes" claim is ambitious, and they have the backgrounds to potentially deliver on it.

But technical ability to build is necessary and not sufficient. The bull case would require that Unisson's product-learning mechanism is so dramatically better than what incumbents can bolt on that enterprise customers switch from their existing CS platforms. It would require that the positioning as "internal teammate" rather than "customer-facing chatbot" creates a genuinely different product category that incumbents can't copy within their existing architecture. And it would require that the founders develop deep customer empathy for technical CS teams through intense, unscalable engagement -- the way Tony Xu at DoorDash personally delivered food to understand logistics he'd never experienced as a consumer. If Varun and Tom go sit with implementation engineers for months, absorb their workflows, and build something that captures institutional knowledge in a way that general-purpose agent frameworks can't replicate, there's a real company here. The enterprise data moat -- where each deployment accumulates customer-specific context that makes switching costly -- is a defensible position if you get there first. But "if you get there first" is doing a lot of work in that sentence when five competitors with more money are running the same race.

The absence of any traction signal compounds the concern. No users, no revenue, no waitlist, no customer logos, no organic sharing. At pre-seed this isn't damning by itself -- many great companies had nothing to show at this stage. But combined with the manufactured-idea concern and the crowded competitive landscape, it means I'm being asked to bet on execution in a race where the founders don't have the organic advantage that would make them the natural favorites. Smart engineers applying AI to a real market is not a terrible bet, but it's not my kind of bet. The companies I back tend to be working on problems that nobody else wants to touch. Everyone wants to touch this one.
