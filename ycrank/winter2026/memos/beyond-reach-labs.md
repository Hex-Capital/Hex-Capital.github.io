## The Idea

**Problem:** Satellites and in-space infrastructure are fundamentally power-constrained. Current satellites collectively use ~20 MW, but projected demand reaches 10 GW+ by 2030 — a 500x increase — driven by orbital datacenters, commercial space stations, and lunar outposts (company website). SpaceX filed with the FCC for a million-satellite orbital AI datacenter megaconstellation (Data Center Dynamics, Jan 2026); Starcloud proposed 88,000 orbital datacenter satellites requiring 5 GW by 2035 (FCC filing, Feb 2026); and Google announced Project Suncatcher for solar-powered AI satellite constellations (Google Research blog). The only way to get more power in orbit today is to launch larger solar panels, which become fragile or impractically expensive as they scale. Specifically, as arrays expand, the first bending mode frequency drops, causing vibration interference with spacecraft attitude control systems (company website). Power constraints currently determine whether entire missions or industries can exist at all.

**Approach:** Beyond Reach Labs has developed two patent-pending deployable structure architectures — Pop-Up Extending Trusses (PETS) and Hierarchical Extending and Reorienting Deployable Structures (HERDS) — that change geometry after deployment in space (company website; beyondreachlabs.io/about via search snippet). These designs break the traditional tradeoff between size, mass, stiffness, and cost by achieving a 20:1 extension ratio. A sample array stows in 1.25 m³, extends to 25 m, and produces 12.5 kW of power (company website). The technology originated from Mitchell Fogelson's CMU PhD research conducted under a NASA NIAC grant on kilometer-scale deployable space structures (UPenn alumni blog; beyondreachlabs.io/about via search snippet). First in-space demonstration is targeted for Q2 2027 (YC page).

**Differentiation:** Existing deployable solar arrays from incumbents like Redwire (Roll-Out Solar Arrays / ROSA, used on ISS and by Axiom Space) achieve deployability but sacrifice structural rigidity at extreme lengths. Beyond Reach Labs claims 10x more usable power without increasing launch mass or volume compared to current solutions, while maintaining structural rigidity (company website). The company's metamaterial-based mechanical approach differs from Redwire's roll-out blanket architecture and from Astradyne's ultralight foldable panel approach. Competitor Astrix (New Zealand) uses inflatable rigidizing arrays, a different deployment mechanism. Beyond Reach Labs' scissor-based truss architecture has been validated in NASA zero-gravity parabolic flight experiments (UPenn alumni blog).

**Business Model:** No pricing page or revenue model is publicly disclosed. [Inferred]: The most likely monetization path is B2B hardware sales and/or power-as-a-service contracts with satellite operators, space station builders, and government agencies, given the capital-goods nature of the product and the $175M+ in LOIs the company reports.

**TAM/SAM:** The global space-based solar power market was estimated at $634.9M in 2024, projected to reach $1.05B by 2030 at 8.5% CAGR (Grand View Research, 2025). The space solar panel and array market specifically is projected to reach $236.9M in 2025, growing at 18.1% CAGR to exceed $3B by 2033 (Global Growth Insights, 2025 via search snippet). The broader space-based solar power market is estimated at $4.7B in 2030, projected to reach $6.8B by 2040 at 3.3% CAGR (MarketsandMarkets via search snippet). Note: these estimates cover varied market definitions; Beyond Reach Labs' serviceable segment is the deployable solar array hardware subsystem for satellites and space stations. No company-specific SAM estimate found.

**GTM / Distribution:** [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct sales to satellite manufacturers, space station developers (e.g., Axiom Space), and government agencies (NASA, DoD). The company reports multiple LOIs totaling $175M+ (YC page), and lists NASA, NSF, Carnegie Mellon University, Innovation Works, and Robotics Factory as backers/partners (company website). Advisory relationships with AFRL veterans and MIT faculty suggest a government-first pathway.

## Defensibility

**IP:** Two patent-pending designs (PETS and HERDS) covering the deployable truss architecture (company website; beyondreachlabs.io/about via search snippet). Technology originated from NASA NIAC-funded PhD research, suggesting IP assignment from Carnegie Mellon to the company or exclusive licensing.

**Technical complexity:** The core innovation sits at the intersection of mechanical metamaterials, deployable mechanisms, and spacecraft structural dynamics — a narrow domain requiring expertise in both aerospace engineering and mechanism design/optimization. Mitchell Fogelson's PhD specifically focused on co-design of controls and mechanical systems for deployable space structures (UPenn alumni blog).

**Switching costs:** Once a satellite or space station is designed around a specific solar array form factor, switching to an alternative array architecture mid-program would require redesigning the spacecraft bus, power distribution, and attitude control systems.

**Regulatory/certification:** Space hardware requires extensive qualification testing (thermal vacuum, vibration, radiation) and mission heritage. Achieving flight heritage through the Q2 2027 demonstration would create a qualification barrier for later entrants.

**Market structure:** Incumbent Redwire (publicly traded, $304M revenue in 2024) has invested heavily in ROSA roll-out blanket architecture. Transitioning to a fundamentally different scissor-truss geometry would require Redwire to cannibalize its existing ROSA product line and retool manufacturing — a classic innovator's dilemma. Northrop Grumman and L3Harris have similar legacy array programs. These incumbents are optimized for their existing architectures and supply chain relationships.

**Commoditization risk:** The patent-pending status provides some protection, but the underlying principles of scissor mechanisms and deployable trusses are known in academic literature. A well-funded competitor with materials science and aerospace expertise could potentially develop alternative deployable geometries. However, the specific optimization of PETS/HERDS for the stiffness-to-mass ratio at scale appears to be a non-trivial engineering achievement tied to years of Fogelson's PhD research.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **Redwire (RDW)** — Publicly traded; $304.1M revenue in FY2024, up 24.7% YoY (Redwire IR, Mar 2025). Acquired Deployable Space Systems (ROSA technology) in 2021. Estimated ~60% market share in space-qualified deployable structures (MatrixBCG via search snippet). Secured ROSA orders from Thales Alenia Space and Axiom Space in 2025 (Redwire IR). Key differentiator vs. Beyond Reach Labs: established flight heritage and manufacturing scale, but uses roll-out blanket architecture which trades off structural rigidity at extreme lengths.

2. **Astradyne** — Italian startup; €2M seed round closed September 2025, led by Primo Capital's Primo Space fund (European Spaceflight, Sep 2025). Developing Solar-Z ultralight foldable solar panels for small satellites. Key differentiator vs. Beyond Reach Labs: focused on lightweight panels for smallsats rather than large-scale deployable trusses for high-power applications.

3. **Aetherflux** — Founded by Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt; $60M total funding including $50M Series A led by Index Ventures (TechCrunch, Apr 2025; SpaceNews). Building space-based solar power beamed to Earth via laser. Key differentiator vs. Beyond Reach Labs: focused on Earth-directed power transmission, not satellite power subsystems; different end market.

4. **Solestial** — $30.1M raised (energystartups.org via search snippet). Developing radiation-hardened solar cells for long-duration space missions. Key differentiator vs. Beyond Reach Labs: focused on cell-level innovation (radiation tolerance) rather than deployable structural architecture.

5. **Astrix (New Zealand)** — Developing Copia, an inflatable rigidizing solar array for higher packing density (search snippet). Funding details not found. Key differentiator vs. Beyond Reach Labs: uses inflatable deployment mechanism rather than scissor-truss mechanical deployment.

**Why now:** Several specific catalysts have converged in 2024-2026: (1) SpaceX filed for a million-satellite orbital AI datacenter constellation with the FCC in January 2026 (Data Center Dynamics); Starcloud filed for 88,000 orbital datacenter satellites in February 2026; and Google announced Project Suncatcher for solar-powered AI satellites — collectively creating unprecedented projected demand for in-space power. (2) Axiom Space's commercial space station modules are under active development, requiring 75-90 kW baseline power capacity (company website). (3) NASA's Artemis program is driving lunar outpost power requirements. (4) Launch costs continue declining via SpaceX reusability, making larger satellite constellations economically viable and increasing the addressable market for high-power solar arrays. [Inferred]: The orbital datacenter wave specifically is the primary "why now" catalyst — these applications require orders of magnitude more power than traditional satellites, creating demand that legacy solar array architectures cannot serve.

**Co-founder relationship:** Collins and Fogelson met 13 years ago as freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania studying mechanical engineering (company description). Both hold UPenn mechanical engineering degrees and UPenn robotics master's degrees. They have known each other since ~2013.

**Founder-market fit:** Fogelson's PhD is directly in the core technology — mechanical metamaterials and deployable structures for space — conducted under a NASA NIAC grant with zero-gravity flight experiments validating the specific scissor-truss architecture that Beyond Reach Labs commercializes. Collins brings 7 years of hands-on SpaceX flight hardware experience, including leading production engineering for human-rated parachute systems — directly relevant to qualifying deployable mechanical systems for space. Collins also has experience at Commonwealth Fusion Systems, another hard-tech hardware company. Their advisory board includes Tom Cooley (25 years at AFRL, former Chief Scientist of Space Vehicles Directorate) and Zac Manchester (MIT professor, Fogelson's PhD co-advisor).

## Key Risks

**Pre-flight-heritage technology risk:** The PETS/HERDS deployable architecture has been tested in zero-gravity parabolic flights but has not yet been demonstrated in orbit. The Q2 2027 in-space demonstration is a critical de-risking milestone. Failure or delays in this demonstration would undermine the $175M+ LOI pipeline. Mitigation: NASA NIAC funding and parabolic flight testing provide partial validation; advisor Tom Cooley's AFRL background may support government-funded test opportunities.

**LOI-to-contract conversion risk:** The reported $175M+ in LOIs are non-binding expressions of interest, not firm contracts. Satellite programs have long procurement cycles and can shift suppliers during development. The actual conversion rate from LOIs to binding purchase orders is unknown. No signed contracts have been publicly disclosed.

**Long sales cycle and capital intensity:** Space hardware requires extensive qualification testing (thermal vacuum, vibration, radiation hardening, electromagnetic compatibility) before flight acceptance. This creates a multi-year timeline from prototype to revenue-generating production. As a 2-person team with pre-seed funding, the company will need significant additional capital to reach production scale. Manufacturing deployable space structures requires specialized facilities and processes.

**Orbital datacenter demand uncertainty:** A significant portion of the projected 10 GW demand by 2030 is attributed to orbital datacenters. While SpaceX, Starcloud, and Google have announced ambitious plans, none of these orbital datacenter constellations are operational. If orbital datacenter timelines slip or economics prove unfavorable, the near-term addressable market may be substantially smaller than projected.

**Concentration risk in customer pipeline:** The $175M+ LOI figure comes from "multiple" space companies, but the exact number and distribution are undisclosed. If the LOI pipeline is concentrated in 1-2 customers or dependent on a single program (e.g., one space station), customer-specific delays or cancellations could disproportionately impact the business.
