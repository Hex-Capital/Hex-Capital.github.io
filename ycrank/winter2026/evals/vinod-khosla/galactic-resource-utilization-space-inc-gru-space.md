# Galactic Resource Utilization Space, Inc. (GRU Space) -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about GRU Space is not the audacity of building a hotel on the Moon -- audacity is cheap. It's that Dr. Kevin Cannon, arguably the world's foremost authority on lunar regolith processing, left his position as CTO at Ethos Space and his professorship at Colorado School of Mines to join a 22-year-old's venture as employee number one. When the person who literally founded the Exolith Lab, created the Planetary Simulant Database, and secured $2 million from NASA for aluminum extraction from regolith chooses to follow a young founder's vision, that's a signal worth paying attention to. It reminds me of the six months I spent in weekly meetings with Pradeep Sindhu before Juniper existed -- a world-class scientist choosing to build something specific with someone specific, before there was a company to join.

The consequence of success here is genuinely civilization-scale, and I don't use that word lightly. If GRU demonstrates commercial ISRU construction on the lunar surface, the hotel is almost incidental -- what you've actually proven is that humans can build permanent infrastructure on another world using local materials. That's a platform technology for the entire lunar economy: roads, warehouses, propellant depots, mass drivers. The company's own long-term plan acknowledges this -- they want to own property and infrastructure on the Moon and Mars as those economies develop. If the ISRU technology works at operational scale, the company that demonstrated it first owns the construction playbook for every structure on the lunar surface. That's not a 20% improvement to an existing workflow. But here's where my expensive education with KiOR forces me to pump the brakes: the technology working and the economics working are two very different things. KiOR produced biofuel. It just cost $5-10 per gallon when oil was under $3. GRU is planning to charge $10 million per guest for four guests at a time -- $40 million per mission cycle against what will likely be billions in cumulative development and launch costs. The unit economics at scale are not just uncertain; they're unknowable at this stage and entirely dependent on assumptions about future launch costs that could be as wrong as my assumption that oil would reach $150 per barrel.

What concerns me most is the dependency chain. My framework explicitly flags companies whose plans require "the technology AND the market AND the regulation AND the team to all work simultaneously." GRU needs: (1) SpaceX Starship or equivalent to achieve reliable, affordable lunar delivery -- a timeline entirely outside their control; (2) ISRU regolith-to-brick conversion to work on the actual lunar surface, which has never been demonstrated; (3) inflatable habitats to survive micrometeoroid impacts, radiation, and thermal cycling in lunar pits; (4) a regulatory framework for commercial lunar habitation that does not currently exist and may conflict with the Outer Space Treaty; and (5) ultra-high-net-worth customers willing to commit $10 million for a five-night lunar stay. That's five simultaneous low-probability requirements. Compare this to Impossible Foods, where the core risk was singular: can you make heme from plants? Or Juniper, where the question was: can you build a TCP/IP router that outperforms Cisco? GRU doesn't have one core risk to de-risk first -- it has five, and several of them are controlled by SpaceX, NASA, and the FAA rather than by GRU itself.

The bull case demands honest engagement. Chan at 22 has already built NASA-funded hardware that flew to space on Virgin Galactic, graduated early from Berkeley EECS, trained as a pilot at 16, and convinced the world's leading regolith scientist to join him. That trajectory suggests a learning rate that is extraordinary, even if the dossier doesn't show me the iterated hypotheses and abandoned assumptions I look for. The phased mission architecture -- 10 kg demo payload in 2029, larger habitat in 2031, full deployment in 2032 -- shows sophisticated staged de-risking, exactly the option-value approach I favor. And the timing on enabling infrastructure is undeniably favorable: Starship is progressing, Artemis is creating supporting systems, CLPS enables private lunar delivery slots. If Starship achieves even a fraction of its projected cost reduction, the entire economic equation for lunar operations transforms. There's a world where this company, with Cannon's ISRU expertise and first-mover demonstration data from the 2029 mission, becomes the default construction partner for every entity operating on the lunar surface. That world is plausible. It's just not probable enough, given the dependency chain, for me to write a check from my own account today.

Where GRU ultimately falls short of my threshold is on the "too important not to work on" test. I backed Impossible Foods because animal agriculture was destroying the planet. I backed Commonwealth Fusion because the world needs clean energy. Lunar tourism for billionaires doesn't carry that same moral urgency. Yes, ISRU technology advancement matters for humanity's multi-planetary future -- but the chosen first application is luxury hospitality, not survival infrastructure. The problem being solved is that wealthy people want novel experiences, not that civilization faces an existential challenge. That's a meaningful distinction in my framework. If Chan had framed this as "building the construction technology platform for permanent human presence on the Moon" with tourism as a funding mechanism rather than the primary product, I'd be leaning differently. The ISRU technology itself is fascinating and Dr. Cannon's involvement is a genuine moat -- but the 6+ year pre-revenue timeline, the multi-dependency execution chain, and the absence of civilizational urgency in the first application keep this in my "watch closely, don't write the check yet" category.
