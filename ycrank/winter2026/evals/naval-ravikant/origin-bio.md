# Origin -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first question I always ask is what the founders know that can't be taught. With Origin, I see two sharp CS undergrads from UIUC who built an NFT marketplace and won a computer vision competition -- and then pivoted into regulatory genomics. That's not specific knowledge in the domain they're attacking. That's general-purpose ML talent pointed at a trending target. Malhar's high school publication in disease modeling and his time at Wadhwani AI show genuine biomedical curiosity, which is more than most CS-to-bio pivots can claim. But regulatory genomics -- understanding how enhancers and promoters control gene expression across cell states, why certain transcription factor binding motifs matter, how in silico predictions fail when they hit the wet lab -- that's a domain where the knowledge compounds over decades. The advisory board is genuinely world-class (Kellis at the Broad Institute is one of the top regulatory genomics researchers alive), but advisors provide air cover, not specific knowledge. The founders still need to bridge the gap between "I can build a model" and "I understand why this biological system behaves the way it does." ML skills are exactly what I'd call teachable knowledge -- powerful, valuable, but replicable. The biology underneath is where the non-transferable insight has to live.

The leverage architecture is where Origin gets more interesting. Axis as a platform for generating synthetic regulatory DNA has the structural shape of infrastructure I've historically backed -- picks and shovels for gene therapy, the way Alchemy is picks and shovels for blockchain development. If the proprietary dataset strategy works, each pharma partnership generates validated sequences that improve the model, which attracts the next partner. That's a compounding data flywheel. One engineer's model serves dozens of pharma programs simultaneously. The leverage ratio is real in theory. But there's a physics constraint embedded in this business that software alone can't solve: synthetic regulatory elements must be validated in wet-lab experiments and ultimately in vivo. Every prediction Axis generates is a hypothesis until a cell proves it right. That validation bottleneck makes this a hybrid business -- software leverage on the generation side, biological labor on the validation side. It's not pure code leverage. It's closer to the Opendoor pattern: algorithmic core wrapped in operational complexity.

The timing isn't contrarian. AI for drug discovery is one of the most consensus categories in technology right now. Gene therapy is a recognized growth market with $55 billion projected by 2034. The competitive landscape confirms consensus pricing: Asimov has raised $205 million, Tessera over $580 million, Dyno $109 million. Origin is bringing a pre-seed check to a domain where incumbents have war chests three orders of magnitude larger. The narrow focus on regulatory DNA rather than full-stack synthetic biology is a defensible niche strategy, but narrowness isn't the same as contrarianism. Nobody smart is arguing that better regulatory elements don't matter -- they're arguing about whether a four-person startup can outcompete both well-funded companies and DeepMind's open research. The Nature Genetics 2025 paper on generative AI for synthetic regulatory DNA means the core methodology is moving toward the academic commons. When the science becomes a published paper, the window for proprietary advantage narrows fast.

The bull case worth taking seriously: if Axis genuinely outperforms AlphaGenome and Origin can build the largest validated dataset of synthetic regulatory sequences before Asimov deepens its own regulatory DNA capabilities, they'd own a critical layer of the gene therapy stack. Pharma companies don't want to build this internally -- it sits outside their core competency. The market is real, growing at 20% annually, and the regulatory DNA layer is genuinely under-tooled. Malhar's trajectory -- Nature publication in high school, healthcare ML at Wadhwani AI, YC experience at Automorphic -- suggests someone who's been gravitating toward this intersection for years, not months. If the advisory board is actively involved (not just lending names), Origin could accumulate biological judgment faster than most ML-first teams. And infrastructure plays in biology can generate enormous value when they work -- look at what Illumina did for sequencing. But that's a lot of "ifs" stacked on unverified performance claims and a dataset that's "being built" rather than built.

I keep coming back to the founder-domain gap. Yash's prior exit was Diginoor, an NFT marketplace -- a hot-market play he surfed and sold. That pattern of riding trends concerns me more than it excites me. The transition from NFTs to regulatory genomics doesn't signal obsessive domain focus; it signals a talented builder scanning for the next wave. I want founders who'd be working on this problem even if nobody was funding it, because their understanding of the domain is so deep that the opportunity is obvious to them in ways it isn't to outsiders. The strongest gene therapy companies I've seen were founded by people who spent years in the lab frustrated by exactly the limitations Origin describes. Origin's founders identified the problem from the outside, through the lens of ML capability, and worked backward to the biology. That's a valid approach -- but it's not the pattern that produces the deepest moats.
