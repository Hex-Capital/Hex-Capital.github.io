# General Legal -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I see here is a team that built and exited the most important legal AI company to date -- Casetext, acquired by Thomson Reuters for $650 million in cash -- and is now coming back to take a fundamentally different shot at the same market. Ryan Walker was CTO through the exit. J.P. Mohler and Javed Qadrud-Din were senior ML researchers there. Two of the three founders have Harvard Law JDs and practiced at exactly the right firms -- Cooley and Fenwick & West, the two firms that represent the most venture-backed startups in the world. This is founder-market fit of the kind I almost never see at pre-seed: they've built the technology, practiced the law, served the customer, and exited the company. If I were constructing the ideal team to build an AI-native law firm for growth-stage startups in a lab, it would look almost exactly like this.

But the structural moment question gives me pause. Legal AI is not a non-obvious market in February 2026. Harvey is at $190 million ARR and an $8-11 billion valuation. Lawhive just raised $60 million and is entering the U.S. Legal tech funding hit $6 billion in 2025. There are two other AI-native law firms in this exact YC batch. When I backed Harvey in 2022, legal AI felt impossible to most investors -- LLMs hallucinated too much for work product that mattered. That structural gap between investor perception and reality is where the asymmetric returns lived. Today, that gap has closed. Everyone sees that AI transforms legal work. The specific angle General Legal is taking -- being the law firm rather than selling tools to law firms -- has some non-obvious elements. BigLaw genuinely cannot match $500 flat-fee contract reviews without cannibalizing their hourly billing model, which creates a structural opening. But the model itself is being replicated simultaneously by multiple well-funded competitors, which tells me this is becoming consensus.

The question I keep coming back to is whether this is software-driven or software-aware. A law firm that uses AI to make attorneys 10x more efficient is still a law firm. Revenue scales with attorney headcount. Each contract requires a barred attorney's review and signature. Malpractice liability sits on the firm's balance sheet. Compare this to Stripe: adding one more developer to the API costs effectively nothing. Or even Gusto, where payroll processing is automated by software with human support. General Legal's core value proposition is "an attorney reviewed and signed off on this" -- which is the one thing you cannot automate away without regulatory change. At $500 per contract, even if a growth-stage company does 50 contracts per year, that's $25,000 per client. Reaching $10 million ARR requires 400+ active clients at that volume, each needing attorney capacity behind them. The margin structure here looks more like a professional services business than a technology platform, regardless of how much AI accelerates the work.

The product-to-distribution potential is where the bull case gets interesting. Commercial contracts are a wedge into a much broader relationship. Every growth-stage startup also needs employment agreements, IP assignments, equity compensation plans, and eventually M&A support. If General Legal captures the commercial contract relationship at $500, they could distribute additional practice areas through that same client relationship -- the way Gusto started with payroll and expanded into HR, benefits, and compliance. The 20+ clients from private preview, presumably from YC networks, represent the beginning of exactly this kind of distribution channel within the startup ecosystem. But each new practice area requires new attorney specialization, not just new software features. The expansion path is real but operationally heavier than a software platform expanding into adjacent products.

The single miracle here is maintaining legal quality at 10x traditional efficiency with viable margins at a $500 price point. That's clear, and the team is organized around it. But I think there's a second miracle lurking: distribution at scale beyond the YC network. Getting 20 clients through founder word-of-mouth and YC relationships is fundamentally different from acquiring 2,000 clients through a scalable go-to-market motion. For a law firm without a software product that generates inbound leads, that distribution challenge is real and distinct from the efficiency miracle.

The strongest version of this investment thesis: the team that built Casetext understands better than anyone alive how to construct AI workflows for legal text. The regulatory barrier of being a licensed law firm creates a moat that Harvey, Spellbook, and every AI-tool-for-lawyers company cannot cross without fundamentally restructuring their business. BigLaw's hourly billing model creates structural inertia that prevents incumbents from competing on price. And the flat-fee model, if it works at scale, could become the default way growth-stage companies consume legal services -- creating a distribution channel into adjacent practice areas that compounds over time. I take that bull case seriously, primarily because of the team's track record. But I keep returning to the margin structure concern: this company needs to prove it can generate technology-company margins from a law firm business model, and the evidence so far doesn't resolve that question. Strong team in a real market with a real structural opening, but the market is consensus, the model has scaling constraints I haven't seen addressed, and the competitive field is crowded and well-capitalized.
