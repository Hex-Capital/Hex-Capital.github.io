# Voxel Energy -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what immediately catches my attention: Crusoe has raised $3.9 billion, has specifically partnered with Redwood Materials on second-life EV batteries for off-grid data centers, and operates 86 sites with a 45 GW power pipeline. Exowatt has $140 million. Lancium has $1.25 billion. EdgeCloudLink has $10 million and is already operational. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's own CTO told me TCP/IP routing would never happen in telecom networks. That dismissal was the signal. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry thought plant-based heme was absurd. The experts laughing is the canary that you're onto something. Nobody is laughing at off-grid data center power — they're pouring billions into it. Every major infrastructure investor and half the AI ecosystem has validated this thesis. The absence of dismissal concerns me. It means Voxel is running a race, not inventing a category.

The problem itself is undeniably massive. $3 trillion in data center projects, half potentially stranded by power constraints — that's a genuine bottleneck on the thing I believe matters most in the next decade, which is AI deployment. If I accept that AI's consequence of success is transformational (and I invested $50 million in OpenAI because I do), then the binding constraint on AI has multiplicative consequences. Unlocking stranded compute demand isn't a 20% improvement to an existing workflow — it's removing the ceiling on a technology curve I believe is exponential. But Voxel doesn't own the AI. They're the picks-and-shovels play, the infrastructure layer. If they succeed, they build a good business and other companies change the world. That's a meaningful consequence but a derivative one. The consequence of Voxel's success is that data centers get built in months instead of years — significant, commercially valuable, but the world doesn't operate on fundamentally different principles.

The DC-native microgrid architecture is the most technically interesting element. Cutting energy conversion losses from 30% to 4% by eliminating AC-DC conversion stages entirely — if that holds at commercial scale, it's a genuine efficiency wedge. GPUs run on DC power natively, so a DC microgrid for AI compute is elegant engineering that maps directly to the physics of the workload. The 5,400% overhead capacity for handling AI power surges suggests they've thought through the bursty load profiles that make traditional data center power design inadequate. This is where Voxel's differentiation lives — not in the solar panels or the batteries, which are commodity, but in the architecture that connects them. The question is whether that architectural advantage is durable. Integration complexity is a real barrier, but it's not the kind of barrier that compounds over time the way a technology moat does. A well-funded competitor with good engineers can replicate an integration approach. They can't replicate a fundamental breakthrough.

Max Pfeiffer's background is the strongest founder signal here. He built Maxwell Vehicles — described as the "first economically sustainable and materially circular model for manufacturing EVs using second-life EV batteries and motors." He's bringing deep, hands-on expertise with the exact enabling technology into an adjacent industry. That's the kind of outsider-with-relevant-capability pattern I've seen work — not a data center insider executing the industry playbook, but an EV battery specialist who understands degradation curves, cell-level quality variance, and BMS design, applying that knowledge where the data center world has no native expertise. Spencer's Tesla Autopilot background and three prior hardware companies show the builder instinct. Schmidt covers the construction domain. The team composition is deliberate — each founder maps to a specific critical risk (battery systems, hardware integration, physical construction). But I see no evidence of the kind of contrarian leap that characterizes my highest-conviction bets. These are capable engineers executing a smart but fundamentally obvious idea. The learning rate question — how fast they've evolved their thinking during YC — I can't assess from the dossier. "Thousands of acres under contract" at pre-seed does suggest exceptional execution velocity, which is itself a form of capability.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. The timing convergence is genuinely powerful: EV battery retirements are accelerating at 41.7% CAGR, AI compute demand is pulling forward every data center timeline, and utility queues are measured in years, not months. Voxel could win not by having better technology than Crusoe, but by being faster and more nimble. Crusoe's 45 GW pipeline is a campus-scale strategy — massive installations that themselves face permitting and construction timelines. Voxel's modular, "vacant lot to powered data center in months" approach could serve the long tail of AI companies that need megawatts, not gigawatts, and can't wait for Crusoe's mega-sites. If the second-life battery supply chain materializes as projected and Pfeiffer's domain expertise gives them preferential access to quality inventory, they could build a distributed network of mid-scale off-grid sites faster than anyone. Speed of deployment could matter more than scale of capital in a market where the constraint is time-to-power, not total capacity. That's a legitimate path to a substantial business.

But a substantial business isn't what I optimize for. My framework asks: does this company, if successful, make the existing approach to data center power structurally obsolete? The answer is no — it provides a parallel path for power-constrained deployments. Traditional grid-connected data centers will continue to serve the majority of compute demand. Voxel fills a gap, an important and growing gap, but it doesn't replace the system. And in the option-value framework I use for portfolio construction, I'm looking for outcomes where either the money expires or the company transforms an industry. Voxel's success case looks more like a profitable infrastructure business than a category-defining transformation. That's not a criticism of the company — it's a recognition that my framework selects for a different type of bet. The team is strong, the timing is right, the problem is real, but the ambition is calibrated to execution excellence rather than to the kind of radical disruption that produces 100x outcomes from a pre-seed entry point.
