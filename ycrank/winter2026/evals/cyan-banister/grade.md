# Grade -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

What catches my attention first about Lotanna is that he's been orbiting this exact problem across multiple companies. He built XPO — a creator payments fintech — raised over a million for it, then moved to Creator Check for creator screening, and now he's back at the payments problem with Grade. That kind of persistent circling tells me something real: this founder has lived inside the creator payment workflow long enough to know where the bodies are buried. It reminds me a little of how I spent years talking with my husband about the taxi medallion racket before Uber came along and I immediately recognized the opportunity. The difference is, when I look at Lotanna's trajectory, I see deep domain familiarity but I don't see the biographical wound — the thing that makes solving this problem existential for the founder. He's an experienced operator who spotted a market gap. That's valuable, but it's not the same signal as someone who has personally suffered from the problem they're solving.

The piece that genuinely concerns me is that creator economy payments is one of the most legible, well-mapped categories in fintech right now. Research firms have sized the TAM. Lumanu has twenty million in funding. Stir raised at a hundred million valuation with a16z leading. MONET just pulled in seventeen million euros. When I look at a space and every institutional investor already has a thesis on it, that's the opposite of the signal I trust. The companies I've done best with — SpaceX, Crusoe, even Contraline — were ones where I had to explain to other investors why the category even existed. Nobody was asking me "which creator payment startup should I back?" when I was writing checks into companies where people questioned whether the market was real. Grade is executing in a validated space, and execution matters, but my portfolio doesn't reward me for picking the best horse in a crowded consensus race.

The bull case here is real, and I want to be honest about it. These founders can ship. James Heaney took Pray Screen from zero to $40K MRR in two months and sold a cryptography startup at twenty-two — that's the kind of velocity that matters at pre-seed. The traction supports it: $380K in payouts in the last thirty days with 120% month-over-month growth, named customers including companies with meaningful scale. The "email-to-pay" workflow with no creator onboarding is genuinely simpler than what Tipalti or Lumanu require, and the performance-based compensation logic built natively into the payment flow is a defensible vertical wedge. If you believe that the shift from flat-fee influencer deals to performance-based pay is structural and irreversible — and the data suggests it is — then Grade is positioned at exactly the right seam. A different investor, one who optimizes for founder-market fit and execution velocity in defined markets, would be writing this check.

I'll also say that the 190-country coverage with tax compliance creates something I do care about — economic access for creators in places where getting paid for digital work is genuinely broken. A creator in Lagos or Nairobi producing content for a U.S. brand and getting paid reliably through a single platform rather than chasing wire transfers and manual invoices — that's a real improvement in someone's economic life. That resonates with the same thread I saw in Uber creating income for drivers and Postmates for delivery workers. It's not the primary use case Grade leads with, but it's in there, and it matters.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the strongest signal for my framework. Lotanna and James have been working together since at least January 2023 at Creator Check — that's three-plus years of building together before Grade, including navigating a product pivot. After what I learned from HQ Trivia about how even perfect timing can't survive founder conflict, I always want to see co-founders who have been tested. These two have been tested. That gives me confidence they won't blow up when things get hard.

But when I sit with this and ask myself whether I feel that jolt — the thing I felt with Niantic, the visceral sense that the world is about to reorganize around this company — I don't feel it here. Grade is a well-built tool solving a real workflow problem in a category where multiple well-funded competitors are already executing. The founders are competent repeat entrepreneurs, not the kind of misfits and free thinkers I'm drawn to. The idea isn't unpopular or difficult to assess — it's straightforward and legible. That's fine for most investors. It's just not the signal that activates my conviction.
