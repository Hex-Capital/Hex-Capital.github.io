# Origin -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment for AI-designed regulatory DNA is real. Genomic foundation models crossed a capability threshold between 2023 and 2025 -- AlphaGenome, the Nature Genetics 2025 paper on generative synthetic regulatory sequences -- that makes de novo promoter and enhancer design computationally feasible for the first time. Gene therapy itself is accelerating: seven FDA-approved therapies as of 2024, pipelines expanding, and the expression-control problem (where, when, how much a therapeutic gene activates) remains a genuine bottleneck that limits clinical safety and efficacy. So the "why now" exists. But here's what I keep coming back to: the same capability jump that makes Origin possible also enables DeepMind, academic labs publishing open-source models, and Asimov with $205M+ in funding and an existing tissue-specific promoter design offering. The inflection point is real but shared. When the structural moment benefits every player equally, the question becomes whether Origin has something that compounds independently -- and I don't see enough evidence of that yet.

The multiple-miracles problem is what concerns me most. Origin needs their Axis model to genuinely outperform alternatives (claimed but unverified against AlphaGenome by any third party). They need wet-lab validation to confirm that in silico predictions translate into functionally useful therapeutic regulatory elements -- a leap the dossier acknowledges is "substantial and unproven." They need pharma companies willing to incorporate unproven synthetic regulatory elements into clinical candidates. And those clinical programs need to advance through multi-year FDA timelines before Origin sees meaningful revenue. That's three to four sequential low-probability events. I've written explicitly about why this pattern fails: compounding small odds produces very small expected outcomes. Compare this to how Harvey was structured -- the single miracle (model fidelity reaching legal-grade accuracy) was being delivered by the foundation model labs, not by Harvey, which freed Harvey to focus entirely on workflow, distribution, and enterprise trust. Origin doesn't have that luxury. Their miracle IS their own model performance, AND it depends on biological validation, AND it depends on pharma adoption cycles they don't control.

The distribution trajectory is constrained in ways that limit my conviction about upside. Regulatory DNA design is a narrow point service for pharma and biotech companies developing gene therapy candidates. The dossier suggests monetization through service-based partnerships and dataset licensing -- both legitimate models, but neither creates a distribution channel for additional products. Asimov already occupies the broader platform position (genetic circuits, manufacturing via AAV Edge, cloud-based design software). Origin's narrow focus on the regulatory layer is deeper but makes it harder to expand into adjacent revenue streams. When I look at my best investments, the initial product created a customer relationship that made distributing additional products natural -- Stripe's developer API became a channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. I struggle to see how "we designed your promoter sequence" becomes a recurring distribution relationship rather than a discrete project engagement.

The strongest bull case deserves serious consideration. Gene therapy's regulatory DNA problem is genuinely boring and niche -- exactly the archetype I've found most investors systematically underestimate. If Origin's proprietary dataset of validated synthetic regulatory sequences achieves meaningful scale, each new partnership generates additional validated sequences that improve Axis, creating a data flywheel that pure computational approaches from academic labs can't replicate. The advisory board is strong for this specific domain -- Kellis at MIT/Broad on regulatory genomics, Paulk at UCSF on AAV gene therapy. And the SAM for regulatory DNA design, while currently small, could expand dramatically if gene therapy pipelines accelerate as projected. My own investment in Color Genomics was in a market (genetic cancer screening) that looked narrow before we drove costs down enough to make population-scale testing feasible. If Origin can demonstrate that AI-designed regulatory elements materially improve gene therapy safety profiles, they could become essential infrastructure for the entire modality. That outcome would make the current competitive landscape irrelevant.

But the bull case requires too many things to go right simultaneously. The founders bring ML capability -- the CEO has a prior exit (Diginoor, an NFT marketplace that raised $1M) and the CTO published in Nature Scientific Reports and has prior YC experience via Automorphic. Those are real execution signals for CS undergrads. But neither founder has deep regulatory genomics or gene therapy domain experience. The CEO's prior venture was in NFTs -- a domain that maps poorly to biotech enabling technology and raises the question of whether this is a team chasing a hot sector (AI for biology) rather than one with structural domain understanding built over years. The advisory board partially compensates, but advisors don't run the company day to day, and navigating pharma partnership dynamics requires operational experience in regulated biotech sales cycles that I don't see evidence of here. This is the kind of company where the technology is a tool for a fundamentally biological business -- closer to "software-aware" than "software-driven" in how value ultimately gets created and captured.
