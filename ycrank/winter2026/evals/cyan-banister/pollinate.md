# Pollinate -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Pollinate is that it's wearing the uniform of the moment. "AI agents for supply chain" is exactly the kind of pitch that's everywhere right now -- every demo day, every investor coffee, every YC batch has some version of this. And that's a problem for me, because the companies I've done best with are the ones that make people uncomfortable, the ones where I have to explain to other investors why I'm even looking at it. Nobody needs convincing that AI agents automating enterprise workflows is a good idea in 2026. When I backed SpaceX, people thought private rocketry was a rich man's hobby. When I wrote my check into Crusoe, people laughed at mining Bitcoin on gas flares. Pollinate doesn't generate that reaction. It generates nods. And nods, in my experience, mean the pricing is already wrong and the differentiation has been competed away before the company even scales.

When I look at Adeep and Corey, I see two young guys with real hustle. Dropping out of university, spending their life savings at eighteen to fly across Australia and talk to customers, delivering wholesale vegetables to restaurants to understand the supply chain firsthand -- that's the kind of thing that catches my attention. I always want to hear the story before the business, and there's something genuine in two high school friends who've been building things together since they were kids, Corey coding since he was twelve, both running scrappy agencies to five figures monthly. That bootstrapping muscle is real. But here's where it falls apart for me: I can't find the biographical thread that ties these founders to ERP automation for deep tech manufacturers. They started with a nightlife app, pivoted to food wholesale, and now they're doing procurement for hardware companies. That's three different problems in less than two years. I don't doubt their ability to grind -- but I need to feel that the founder and the problem are inseparable, that they'd be working on this even if no investor ever said yes. What I see instead is two talented hustlers searching for the right wave to ride, and right now they've landed on the wave everyone else is riding too.

The bull case here is worth taking seriously. ERP systems are genuinely broken -- they're these monolithic, rigid architectures that force supply chain teams into spreadsheet hell, and if Pollinate's ontology layer actually works as described, it could become the connective tissue between messy real-world data and automated workflows. The 80/20 model -- eighty percent platform, twenty percent bespoke -- is a smart way to balance scalability with the customization enterprise customers demand. And ERP integrations, once deployed, create real switching costs. If they nail a few more customers and build deep integrations across SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, the accumulated workflow data becomes a moat that competitors can't just replicate with a better model. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that these two founders, despite having no enterprise software background, can sell into and retain hardware manufacturers who are accustomed to buying from forty-year-old incumbents like Basware -- and that they can do it faster and more reliably than Ovlo, Lighthouz, and every other AI startup attacking the same wedge. It's possible. But it requires a lot of things to go right simultaneously, and none of those things are rooted in something only this team can do.

What I'd want to see but don't: a company that creates economic access or makes a power structure transparent for people who currently lack visibility. Carta did this for employees who couldn't understand their equity. Affirm did this for borrowers trapped in hidden fees. Flock Safety did this for communities without access to public safety data. Pollinate makes procurement more efficient for hardware manufacturers -- that's valuable, but it's operational optimization for companies that already have purchasing power. It doesn't create new economic participation. It doesn't pull anyone into the economy who was previously locked out.

The one dimension where I feel genuinely good is the co-founder relationship. High school friends who code, who dropped out together, who spent their savings together, who've pivoted twice and are still building side by side -- that's a relationship that's been tested. After HQ Trivia taught me what happens when co-founders can't resolve conflict, I pay close attention to this. Adeep and Corey seem to have the kind of earned trust that comes from shared sacrifice over years, not just shared ambition over months. If they eventually find the problem that's truly theirs -- the one where their story and the mission become the same thing -- this partnership could produce something special. But right now, I'm passing. The consensus heat around AI agents, the lack of a personal stake in this specific problem, and the crowded competitive landscape all tell me this isn't my kind of bet.
