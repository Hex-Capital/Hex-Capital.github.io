# Maywood -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Datasite spent over $200 million acquiring Grata and Blueflame AI in the first half of 2025, and CapVest committed another $500 million to expand its capabilities. That's the most important fact in this entire dossier, and it cuts both ways. It validates that AI-augmented M&A execution is a real market -- incumbents don't spend nine figures acquiring companies in imaginary categories. But it also signals what I'd call a potential market-ending move. Datasite has $157.9 million in revenue, 1,400+ employees, and existing relationships with the banks Maywood needs to sell to. When an incumbent with that distribution footprint starts acquiring AI capabilities in your exact vertical, the window for a startup to establish itself narrows rapidly. The question for Maywood is whether they can build enough integration depth and firm-specific customization to become genuinely sticky before Datasite bolts acquired AI onto its existing data room platform and bundles it into the contract banks are already paying for.

The market itself doesn't fit my preferred archetype. M&A advisory is a $48.8 billion market that every AI investor can see on a slide deck. "AI for investment banking" isn't boring, niche, or unfamiliar to most investors -- it's a consensus category with at least four funded competitors and an incumbent on an acquisition spree. When I invested in PagerDuty, nobody thought operations alerting was interesting. When I backed Gusto, "payroll software" made other investors yawn. Maywood is operating in the opposite environment: a glamorous market where capital is already flowing. The "why now" -- LLM capabilities crossing a threshold for generating complex financial documents -- is real but shared by every AI-for-finance company raising money in 2025 and 2026. That's not a structural inflection unique to Maywood; it's a tide lifting all boats, including incumbent boats.

Where I do see signal is in the execution and the vertical specificity of the wedge. SOC 2 Type II compliance at what appears to be a 2-3 person pre-seed team is unusual -- that certification typically takes months and real operational discipline. Having real bank customers providing testimonials about "doubling capacity" and "doubling deal count" at this stage suggests the team isn't just building demos. Drake's Blackstone PE background gives him credibility in rooms where most 25-year-old founders would be politely ignored, and Esteban's ICML 2024 publication shows genuine ML research depth rather than API-wrapping. The focus on sell-side execution materials (CIMs, teasers, diligence responses) rather than deal sourcing is a thoughtful wedge that's slightly more specific than what the acquired competitors were doing.

The bull case I'd need to believe: Maywood becomes the Figma of M&A execution -- a purpose-built tool so deeply integrated into daily workflow that banks can't rip it out even when Datasite offers something bundled. If every analyst's CIM starts in Maywood, if the platform accumulates firm-specific formatting conventions and historical deal patterns, if updates propagate across all outputs in real time -- that's not a feature a data room vendor can replicate by bolting on an acquisition. The "connected platform" vision where Maywood touches a bank's files, emails, meetings, and internal databases creates real switching costs. And if the team can layer on additional products through that integration -- compliance monitoring, deal analytics, automated buyer outreach -- the product-to-distribution trajectory starts to look more like infrastructure than a point solution. The sibling co-founder dynamic (Drake and Kent Goodman) could also be a strength -- pre-tested relationship with deep trust, which matters given that co-founder conflict is one of the three things that kills pre-PMF companies.

But I keep coming back to the competitive dynamics. The core technology -- applying LLMs to generate formatted financial documents -- is replicable. Maywood's defensibility depends on integration depth and firm-specific customization, which takes time to compound. Meanwhile, Datasite has the distribution advantage of existing contracts with the banks Maywood is trying to reach, and enterprise sales cycles to investment banks run 6-12 months. That's a race Maywood could lose even with a better product. OffDeal's approach of building an AI-native investment bank rather than selling tools to banks is arguably the more structurally disruptive model -- it eliminates the distribution problem by going directly to the deal flow. Maywood's tools-for-banks model is safer but potentially less defensible if the tools can be commoditized by a well-resourced incumbent.

The team has the credentials and early execution to be competitive, but the market structure doesn't give me the asymmetric setup I look for. This isn't a situation where the adoption curve is inflecting while most investors think it's impossible -- it's a situation where everyone can see the opportunity and capital is already flowing in from multiple directions. Competent team, real market, decent velocity, but no structural edge that makes this a bet I'd prioritize with my own capital over other opportunities in my pipeline.
