# Protent -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I look at here is the competitive landscape, because it tells the structural story. Ambient.ai has raised $146M from a16z and already markets "proactive" threat prevention to enterprise customers like Adobe and VMware, claiming 4x growth since 2022. Spot AI has $93M. Lumana has $64M. This is not a non-obvious market -- it's a well-funded, consensus-hot category where multiple competitors have 10-100x more capital than Protent. When I see a pre-seed company entering a market where the "proactive surveillance" positioning has already been staked by a $146M competitor, I'm looking at what I'd call a market-ending move dynamic. Ambient.ai hasn't won the entire AI surveillance market, but they've captured the specific narrative and customer relationships that Protent would need. The dossier's TAM numbers ($6.51B growing to $28.76B) are exactly the kind of static market research that doesn't tell me anything about whether a structural moment exists for a new entrant. The market is growing, but it's growing for incumbents who are already there.

The strongest signal in Protent's favor is the defense-origin technology -- Balaji deployed reinforcement learning-optimized video intelligence in classified settings at Lockheed Martin. I'm generally drawn to companies where regulatory or classification barriers create moats that commercial competitors can't replicate through acquisition. That's the pattern I saw in Anduril and Coinbase. But here the moat has a structural problem: classified training data almost certainly cannot be transferred to a commercial product. ITAR and classification restrictions mean Protent likely has to rebuild its training datasets from scratch using commercially available data. So what transfers is the team's experiential knowledge -- knowing what escalation patterns look like, understanding the RL optimization approach -- but not the actual trained models or data. That's valuable but it's expertise, not a compounding data advantage. And expertise is a head start, not a moat.

The differentiation claim -- escalation trajectory prediction versus object detection -- is the kind of technical distinction that sounds meaningful in a pitch but needs scrutiny. Protent says it identifies behavioral precursors before incidents escalate, while competitors detect discrete objects (guns, intruders). That's a real technical difference: temporal sequence modeling versus frame-level classification. But Ambient.ai's marketing already claims contextual scene understanding that goes beyond simple object detection, and Lumana is using vision-language models for "self-learning" surveillance. The question is whether escalation prediction is a separable market or a feature that well-funded competitors will add to their platforms within 18 months. My instinct is that it's a feature. The surveillance buyer wants a comprehensive platform, not a point solution for one type of intelligence. This creates a distribution problem: Protent either needs to build a full platform (competing directly with $100M+ funded companies) or integrate as a layer into existing VMS platforms (becoming a feature that can be commoditized).

For the bull case to work, you'd need to believe three things: (1) escalation prediction requires fundamentally different ML approaches (RL, temporal modeling) that object-detection-focused competitors can't easily replicate, (2) Protent can build commercially viable training datasets that capture real escalation scenarios without classified data, and (3) the team can build enterprise distribution in high-security verticals despite having no visible GTM motion and facing competitors with established customer relationships. That's approaching a multi-miracle plan. The single miracle should be demonstrating that escalation prediction works reliably in commercial settings -- but the distribution miracle looms as a second independent obstacle that the founding team hasn't visibly addressed. No public traction, no visible product (the website returned only framework code), no stated GTM strategy. When a pre-seed company is entering a market with this level of competitive intensity, I need to see either extraordinary founder velocity or a fundamentally different distribution approach. I see neither in the available evidence.

The Hardware tag also gives me pause. SaaS plus proprietary edge hardware at pre-seed, with a two-person team, in a market that demands enterprise-grade reliability -- this is capital-intensive in a way that conflicts with the rapid iteration cycles I weight heavily. The defense-tech background makes the hardware component intelligible (edge inference for classified environments), but commercially it means higher CAC, longer sales cycles, and margin structures that look more like security hardware than pure software. I look for software-driven businesses where the technology creates compounding advantages. A company that needs to ship hardware to every deployment site risks becoming software-aware rather than software-driven.

I respect the founders' domain backgrounds -- Lockheed Martin RL research and NLP-based threat detection are directly relevant, and this isn't a team that pivoted into security because it's getting funded. But relevant backgrounds without execution evidence aren't sufficient at a stage where the market already has well-capitalized participants. The absence of any visible product, any traction signal, or any articulated distribution strategy makes it impossible to evaluate execution velocity. This is a pass for me -- the market is consensus, the competitive dynamics are unfavorable for a new entrant, and the structural barriers that would normally excite me (defense-origin technology) face a translation problem that adds rather than reduces the miracle count.
