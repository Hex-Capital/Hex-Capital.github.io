# 10x Science -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment here is specific and compelling -- and it's not the usual "AI exists" thesis. AI-powered protein design tools (AlphaFold, RFdiffusion, generative models from David Baker's lab) crossed a production-maturity threshold in 2023-2025, creating a demand-side shock downstream. Biopharma pipelines are now flooded with computationally designed protein drug candidates, but every one of them still has to pass through the same characterization bottleneck -- peptide mapping, post-translational modification analysis, proteoform quality assessment -- using legacy software that was architected for a world producing a fraction of the candidates. This is the pattern I look for: not "the market is large" but "something structural has changed in the last 24 months that breaks existing workflows." The upstream acceleration from AI protein design is real, measurable, and getting worse. The downstream characterization tools haven't adapted. That gap is the market.

What makes this non-obvious in the way I care about is the "boring but critical" archetype. Protein characterization software is the kind of thing that makes other investors' eyes glaze over -- it's analytical plumbing, not the glamorous front end of drug discovery. When someone says "AI for biopharma," investors think drug design, target identification, clinical trial optimization. Almost nobody is thinking about the mass spectrometry analysis step between design and clinical trials. That dismissive reaction is exactly what I saw with PagerDuty (operations alerting seemed boring until you realized every company running software needed it) and Gusto (payroll seemed boring until you realized every employer needed it). The deeper structural dynamic is also familiar from my Color Health experience: the incumbents here -- Thermo Fisher's BioPharma Finder, Waters' UNIFI -- have a structural conflict. Their software is bundled with instrument hardware sales. Building a best-in-class instrument-agnostic platform would cannibalize their lock-in strategy. This is the same reason PayPal couldn't build Stripe: the incumbent's business model prevented them from building the right product.

The founder-market fit is genuinely exceptional. Roberts has a PhD in exactly this domain -- analytical chemistry, top-down mass spectrometry, proteoform characterization -- with 50+ publications and postdoctoral work in Carolyn Bertozzi's Nobel Prize-winning lab at Stanford. Reiter trained at the Broad Institute's Proteomics Platform, one of the top mass spectrometry facilities globally. These two have lived inside the pain point. The CTO, Tejus, brings the startup scaling dimension: founding engineer at Nooks through a $43M Series B from Kleiner Perkins. That combination -- two deep domain scientists plus a technical builder who has shipped and scaled at a YC company -- is the right team composition for a regulated, technically dense market. The "2x YC Founder" claim on the company page is worth a diligence flag -- public records list Tejus as "Founding Software Engineer" at Nooks, not co-founder -- but this is a terminology concern, not a credibility implosion.

Where I hesitate is on three fronts. First, the software-only SAM is genuinely unclear. The market estimates range from $2.6B to $18B, but those figures include instruments and reagents. The addressable slice for a pure software platform could be meaningfully smaller -- maybe $300M-$500M in near-term software spend. That's not tiny, but it constrains the upside ceiling unless the company expands into adjacent analytical workflows. Second, Dotmatics (which acquired Protein Metrics) has 200+ biopharma customers with validated workflows already embedded in regulatory submissions. Adding AI features to an existing installed base is easier than displacing an incumbent in regulated environments where change triggers revalidation costs. Third, and most practically, biopharma enterprises adopt new analytical tools slowly, especially for regulatory-grade work. The single miracle here is enterprise trust and regulatory validation -- achievable, but potentially a 3-5 year sales cycle before the compounding effects kick in. That's long for a pre-seed company burning through runway.

The bull case is straightforward: if 10x Science becomes the instrument-agnostic analytical layer for biologics characterization, they become infrastructure. Every lab running multi-vendor mass spec instruments (which is most large biopharma analytical development groups) would prefer a single platform over juggling Thermo's software for Thermo instruments and Waters' software for Waters instruments. Start with peptide mapping, expand to glycan analysis, intact protein analysis, aggregation studies, forced degradation -- each of these is currently handled by different tools. That's a product-to-distribution path: the initial peptide mapping wedge becomes the distribution channel for a comprehensive analytical platform. If they can accumulate proprietary training data from customer characterization runs, the AI models improve and create a data flywheel that pure-software competitors can't replicate without the domain-specific data. Regulatory embedding creates switching costs. This is the Color Health pattern applied to biopharma analytics: use software and AI to automate an expensive, manual process in a regulated environment where compliance becomes the moat. I've seen this work.

But I'm not seeing enough evidence of distribution thinking or execution velocity to push this into invest territory yet. No shipped product, no traction signals, no evidence the founders have articulated their go-to-market beyond what the domain expertise implies. The structural moment is real, the team composition is right, and the market archetype fits my pattern. If I saw evidence of a working prototype being used by even one biopharma analytical team, or a signed LOI, or a concrete distribution strategy targeting multi-vendor labs, I'd lean more aggressively. Right now it's a strong thesis in search of execution proof.
