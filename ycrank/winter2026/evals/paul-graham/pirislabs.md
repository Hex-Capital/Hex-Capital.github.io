# Piris Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Piris Labs is that they're entering a space where schlep blindness doesn't apply. The whole framework of schlep blindness is that smart people unconsciously avoid problems that involve painful, tedious complexity -- and because they avoid them, competition is structurally low. Photonic AI infrastructure in 2026 is the opposite of that. Lightmatter has $850M. Ayar Labs has $370M and NVIDIA as an investor. Olix has $250M. Neurophos has $118M. Over $1.5 billion has already been deployed by people who can see this opportunity perfectly well. When I said the most impressive YC companies I'd seen recently were not working on AI, this is what I meant. The problems that attract a billion and a half dollars in competitive capital are not the hidden ones. Whatever Piris Labs' advantages turn out to be, structural invisibility is not one of them.

The organic discovery question is genuinely interesting here, though, because it cuts both ways. Ali Khalatpour didn't read about photonics in TechCrunch and decide to start a company. He built terahertz semiconductor lasers at MIT. He designed the optical engine for NASA's GUSTO telescope -- a real instrument on a real space mission. That's not manufactured expertise. He has spent his entire career thinking about how to make light do useful things. But there's a version of organic discovery that's actually a trap: "I have deep expertise in X, and X is suddenly hot, so let me apply X to the hottest possible market." That's not stumbling into a problem through lived pain. That's matching a skill to a trend. The dossier gives me no founder narrative about a specific moment where Khalatpour personally hit the memory wall while running inference workloads and realized photonic interconnects were the answer. Instead it reads like two PhDs with complementary skills -- one in photonics, one in ML infrastructure -- who assembled a company to ride the photonic AI wave. The Twitter account was created in January 2026. The co-founders have no shared employer or university. I have no evidence they knew each other before deciding to start this.

The "full-stack inference service" positioning is the one genuinely novel strategic idea here, and I want to give it its due. Every other photonic AI company sells components -- interconnects, chiplets, processors -- to data center operators who have to integrate them. Piris Labs says they'll sell inference as a service, combining their own photonic hardware with a software stack. If this works, it's clever: you don't need to convince NVIDIA's customers to rip out their infrastructure, you just need to deliver cheaper tokens. The service model also creates switching costs that component sellers don't get. This is the kind of vertical integration play that occasionally produces enormous outcomes. But "if this works" is carrying a lot of weight in that sentence. They need to design photonic hardware, fabricate it, build a software stack to rival NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem, deploy it at data center scale, and sell inference to customers -- all starting from a 2-person team with $500K. Neurophos has $118M and won't have chips until mid-2028. Olix has $250M and won't ship until 2027. The capital intensity mismatch here isn't a gap -- it's a chasm.

The strongest bull case would go like this: Khalatpour is one of perhaps a hundred people on Earth who have actually built photonic devices that worked in production conditions (the GUSTO telescope is operating in space). Moghadam scaled ML systems at Meta. Together they could leverage existing silicon photonics fabs through ODM partnerships -- that "Chip/ODM partners" contact email suggests they're not planning to build their own fab. If they can prove 2x cost-per-token advantage with a small proof-of-concept deployment, the service model means they don't need the massive capital that component companies require for manufacturing scale. They just need enough hardware to run a service. And inference demand is exploding right now as AI applications move from development to production. That's a real bull case. But it requires believing that two people with half a million dollars can build working photonic inference hardware before Lightmatter's $850M operation gets there -- and there's not a single piece of evidence in this dossier that they've built anything yet. No prototype. No benchmark. No demo. The website is a tagline.

The performance claims -- 5x lower latency, 10x lower power, 2x lower cost per token -- appear only on the YC page with no supporting data, no third-party validation, and no visible prototype to benchmark against. These are the kind of numbers you put in a pitch deck, not the kind you've measured. I don't penalize pre-seed companies for lacking traction, but I do notice when a hardware company makes specific quantitative claims without any evidence of having built the hardware. That's not a sign of earnestness -- it's a sign of optimizing for fundraising rather than building.

I keep coming back to the multiple miracles problem. This company needs a technological miracle (photonic hardware that works at data center scale), a competitive miracle (beating teams with 100-1000x more capital), a commercial miracle (convincing enterprise customers to trust critical inference infrastructure to a startup), and a capital miracle (raising the tens of millions needed for hardware development before the window closes). Each one is plausible. The product of all four is not. Khalatpour's photonic expertise is real and rare. But rare expertise in a crowded, well-capitalized market is not the same as organic problem discovery in a space no one else wants to touch. This is a pass.
