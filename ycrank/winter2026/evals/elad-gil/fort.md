# Fort -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most interesting analytical question about Fort is whether WHOOP's own data proves Fort's thesis or disproves it. WHOOP reported 122% year-over-year growth in strength workouts on their platform between 2024 and 2025. Most founders would cite that number as market validation. I read it as the opposite: the incumbent already has the users, already has the training data, and already has the sensor hardware (wrist-worn IMU plus optical heart rate) to build exactly what Fort is building. When the fastest-growing behavior on an incumbent's platform is the same behavior a startup is targeting, the structural advantage flows to the incumbent, not the challenger. WHOOP can ship a strength-detection algorithm update to millions of existing devices. Fort has to manufacture, distribute, and sell new hardware to capture a single user.

The structural moment question is where Fort falls short for me. What has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes a dedicated strength wearable possible now? The dossier identifies three factors -- strength training's mainstream adoption, sensor miniaturization, and WHOOP normalizing screenless bands -- but none of these represent a sharp inflection point. Strength training has been growing steadily for five-plus years. IMU and PPG sensors have been commodity components for nearly a decade. WHOOP launched its screenless form factor in 2015. There's no GPT-2-to-GPT-3 equivalent here, no cost curve that just bent, no regulation that just shifted. The "why now" amounts to "strength training is popular and existing wearables don't serve it well." That's a market observation, not a structural moment. When I compare this to Harvey -- where the specific capability jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4 created a window for legal AI that didn't exist 18 months prior -- Fort's timing thesis feels like a gradual trend, not an inflection.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is where I struggle most. My core framework asks: can this product become a distribution channel for additional products? Stripe's payment API became the channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Figma's design tool became the channel for FigJam and developer handoff. Fort is a sub-30g wristband that counts reps. What's the second product? A subscription analytics tier is a revenue stream, not a platform. Hardware companies almost never become distribution channels the way software infrastructure does because the marginal cost of distributing additional value through a physical device is fundamentally different from distributing it through a software integration. The business model -- $349 device plus a bundled year of premium analytics -- structurally caps the relationship to what the hardware can sense. This is a product company, not a platform company, and single-product hardware companies have structurally limited upside in my framework.

The bull case is worth engaging seriously. The team is genuinely exceptional for a consumer hardware startup. Three Tesla engineers who worked on 4680 battery cells, cabin sensing systems, and vehicle structures for Cybertruck and Cybercab -- that's real manufacturing DNA, not theoretical hardware experience. Most hardware startups fail at the prototype-to-production transition; these founders have done that transition at Tesla's scale. The multi-mount form factor (wrist, magnetic equipment attachment, body straps) is a legitimate hardware design insight that WHOOP and Oura can't replicate without new SKUs. And the strength training market is genuinely underserved -- anyone who's tried to track a strength workout on an Apple Watch knows the experience is terrible. If Fort nails exercise auto-detection accuracy to the point where it eliminates manual logging entirely, the product could generate the kind of user love that bootstraps a consumer brand organically. The "too niche" archetype applies here -- most investors would dismiss a strength-only wearable as too narrow, which is usually where I get interested. If this were software infrastructure for strength training rather than consumer hardware, my conviction would be meaningfully higher.

But the structural problems compound. This company needs multiple miracles to succeed: (1) achieve exercise auto-detection accuracy good enough to replace manual logging across 50+ exercises, (2) manufacture and ship consumer hardware at scale with viable unit economics, and (3) build a consumer brand that competes with WHOOP's $260M-revenue marketing engine. That's three low-probability events multiplying against each other. The core technology -- IMU-based motion detection plus optical heart rate -- uses commodity sensors, which means the algorithmic differentiation has to be extraordinary to create a durable moat. And WHOOP, with millions of users already doing strength workouts on their platform, has a compounding data advantage for training the same models. Fort's "software-aware" dimension concerns me: remove the algorithms and you have a $350 wristband with sensors you can buy on Alibaba. The software layer is a feature of the hardware, not the fundamental driver of the business. That's closer to a smart toaster than to software infrastructure.

The technology cycle timing is neutral at best. There's no evidence of a specific sensor capability or AI model threshold being crossed that enables what Fort is building. On-device ML inference has been viable for years. Low-power IMUs have been cheap for years. The timing thesis is "the market wants this now," which may be true but doesn't create the kind of structural positioning advantage I look for -- where building ahead of a capability curve lets you capture market share the moment the curve crosses a threshold. Fort is building at market demand, not ahead of a capability curve, which means competitors can enter at any time with the same tools.
