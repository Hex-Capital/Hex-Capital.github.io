# Return Signals -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's a physicist with 836 citations who built one of the largest patient-facing AI systems in American healthcare -- SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente, trained on 25 million primary care encounters -- and he's now building a chatbot to help people exchange sweaters instead of returning them. That trajectory tells me something important, and it's not flattering to the company. Ilya Valmianski has the raw capability to work on problems that reshape how healthcare operates at a civilizational level, and he's chosen to optimize margin retention for DTC apparel brands. I don't invest in talent-problem mismatches where the talent is pointed downward.

Let me start where I always start: if Return Signals succeeds completely -- captures dominant market share, converts returns to exchanges across the entire e-commerce landscape -- what changes? Shopify merchants keep more revenue. The returns management software market grows from $2 billion to $4 billion and Return Signals captures a meaningful slice. That's a business. It's not a transformation. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. Animal agriculture still occupies half the planet's arable land, fossil fuels still power the grid, and the healthcare system still misdiagnoses millions of people. Return Signals' success means some brand founder in Brooklyn saves 5-10% on margins. I've seen hundreds of these pitches -- companies that have carefully de-risked every dimension until what remains, if everything works perfectly, is a modest SaaS business in a crowded vertical. They've chosen a real problem ($849 billion in US returns), a proven channel (SMS), safe integrations (Shopify), and a narrow beachhead (DTC apparel). Every single choice minimizes downside. And the result is that success is inconsequential.

The competitive landscape confirms this diagnosis. Loop Returns has raised $176 million and claims $2.4 billion in retained sales across 5,000+ brands. Narvar's IRIS AI layer processes 74 billion interactions annually. AfterShip does $85 million in revenue serving 11,000 customers. Return Signals' differentiation is that it initiates outbound SMS before the customer starts a return, rather than offering a self-serve portal. That's a feature. It's a good feature -- the 70% exchange conversion claim, if validated at scale, is genuinely impressive. But any of these incumbents could add proactive SMS outreach in a quarter. The dossier itself acknowledges the core capability is "technically reproducible" by "any team with access to large language models, SMS APIs, and Shopify integration." When your own competitive analysis admits the technology is replicable, you're not building a disruptive technology -- you're building a workflow improvement with a temporary execution lead.

The strongest bull case would be this: Ilya's experience building conversational AI at Kaiser's scale gives Return Signals a genuine edge in tuning AI agents for nuanced, empathetic conversations that accumulate a proprietary data moat over time. The 74% response rate and 95% positive sentiment suggest something qualitatively different from typical customer service bots. If the data flywheel works -- millions of post-purchase conversations training increasingly effective exchange recommendation models -- Return Signals could expand from returns to become the AI-powered post-purchase relationship layer for all of e-commerce. The proactive concierge model could extend to upselling, cross-selling, warranty management, loyalty. In that scenario, you're not in the $2 billion returns management market -- you're competing for a share of the entire post-purchase customer experience. I take this seriously as a possibility. Ilya has demonstrably built conversational AI systems at massive scale in healthcare, which is harder than e-commerce. But even in this maximally optimistic scenario, the consequence of success is still "e-commerce brands manage customer relationships more effectively." It's not the kind of outcome where I ignore probability of failure because the magnitude of success demands the attempt.

On timing and technology trajectory: the argument that LLM capabilities crossed a quality threshold in 2023-2025 is accurate but entirely consensus. Every investor, every founder, every corporate strategy team on the planet knows that LLMs are now good enough for customer-facing applications. This is not skating to where the puck will be -- this is arriving at the rink after the game started. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was "laughable" to most investors. I tracked the rate of improvement in model capability and the acceleration of talent flow and concluded the trajectory was exponential before it was obvious. Return Signals is applying LLMs to e-commerce in 2026. That's not a contrarian timing bet; it's the most crowded application category in technology right now.

The team pairing is reasonable -- a technical ML builder with a commercial operator -- but neither founder has e-commerce or retail experience. MDandMe, Ilya's previous company, raised $2 million in June 2023 and appears to have been wound down by 2025 without public explanation. I don't penalize founders for pivoting -- some of my best investments came from founders who learned fast and changed direction. But I'd want to understand the learning rate through that pivot: what did Ilya discover at MDandMe that pointed him toward e-commerce returns rather than back toward healthcare, where his consequence magnitude would be orders of magnitude larger? The absence of that narrative leaves me wondering whether this was a retreat to a safer problem rather than an advance toward a harder one.
