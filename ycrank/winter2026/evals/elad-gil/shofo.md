# Shofo -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice is that Shofo's entire business sits on legally unstable ground. The company's core asset -- its "world's largest index of short-form videos" -- is built by indexing content from TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X. These platforms actively restrict scraping, enforce terms of service violations, and are increasingly litigating unauthorized data access (the hiQ v. LinkedIn line of cases has not resolved this cleanly). Simultaneously, content creators and their representatives are suing AI companies over training data usage -- Getty v. Stability AI is the leading example, but it is not the last. Shofo isn't just labeling data that customers bring, it's sourcing third-party creative content and repackaging it for commercial AI training. That is a legal exposure that is getting worse, not better, as the regulatory environment tightens around training data provenance. This isn't a moat -- it's a liability disguised as an asset.

The structural moment in this market is real but consensus. Yes, multimodal AI models are driving enormous demand for video training data -- the 32% CAGR for video annotation is genuine, and Meta's acquisition of 49% of Scale AI genuinely disrupted the dominant platform's neutrality. Google and OpenAI seeking alternatives to Scale AI is a real opening. But this is not a non-obvious market. Every data infrastructure investor I know is tracking this exact dynamic. The Scale AI disruption creates an opportunity, but the beneficiaries are more likely to be well-capitalized companies like Encord ($110M raised, already serving 300+ physical AI teams) or Labelbox ($189M raised, $50M revenue) that can add video sourcing to existing enterprise relationships, not a pre-seed startup with no disclosed customers or revenue. When the structural opening is visible to everyone, the question shifts from "is this a real market?" to "can this team win against well-funded incumbents?" -- and on that question, the evidence is thin.

I count at least three sequential miracles this company needs: (1) maintain and expand access to social media platform data despite active legal and technical countermeasures, (2) build a video index large and clean enough to matter before incumbents build the same thing, and (3) sell into a tiny buyer segment -- perhaps 20-30 major AI labs globally -- that has the engineering resources to replicate this pipeline internally if the economics justify it. Compounding those odds makes this structurally unattractive under my framework. Compare this to Harvey, where the single miracle -- model fidelity reaching legal-grade accuracy -- was being delivered by the foundation model labs, freeing the team to focus entirely on workflow, distribution, and enterprise trust. Shofo's miracles are all things the team must solve themselves, and each one involves entities (platforms, courts, well-funded competitors) actively working against them.

The strongest bull case: if Shofo actually builds a comprehensive, clean, queryable video index with annotation taxonomies calibrated across dozens of customer projects, the accumulated data asset and institutional knowledge become genuinely hard to replicate -- similar to how Common Crawl became essential infrastructure for web-scale text training. The founders showed real execution with Correkt, reaching 40k users as undergraduates. The YC network gives them warm introductions to exactly the AI labs they need as customers. And if the legal landscape settles favorably -- perhaps through licensing deals with platforms or legislative clarity on training data usage -- the first mover in video data infrastructure could build a durable position. If all of that comes together, this could be a meaningful company. But that is the multi-miracle problem in action: you need the legal landscape, the competitive dynamics, and the sales motion to all break your way simultaneously.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is limited. Today this is a consultative, high-touch data procurement service -- clients specify criteria, Shofo delivers annotated datasets. The API offering could eventually become a self-service channel, but there is no evidence the founders have thought about how the initial product becomes a distribution channel for additional products. This is a single-product company in a market where the product (curated video data) can be commoditized. The dossier itself acknowledges: "Web scraping and video indexing are technically feasible for well-resourced teams." When the barrier is time and cost rather than fundamental technical complexity, you are building a services business with software tooling, not a software-driven company that compounds. A well-funded labeling company adding a video index is a feature addition, not a company-building effort.

On founder execution: the Correkt pivot from 40k-user AI search engine to video data infrastructure is a meaningful signal -- it shows the team can build, ship, and recognize when to change direction. But Shofo itself has zero visible traction: no disclosed revenue, no named customers, 149 Twitter followers with zero posts. The founders are young and relatively inexperienced -- internships at MongoDB and Adobe, a UCSB NLP research position, and an AWS stint do not constitute the kind of deep domain expertise I typically want to see in a company navigating complex legal, enterprise sales, and data infrastructure challenges simultaneously. This is not disqualifying at pre-seed, but combined with the multi-miracle problem and consensus market positioning, there is not enough signal to override the structural concerns.
