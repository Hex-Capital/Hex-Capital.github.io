# ZeroSettle -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about ZeroSettle is that it's building on a court ruling that's actively being relitigated. The Epic v. Apple injunction in April 2025 opened the door to external iOS payment flows. But by December 2025 -- before ZeroSettle even entered YC -- a U.S. appeals court ruled Apple should be able to charge a "reasonable commission" on externally linked purchases. The company's entire value proposition is the spread between Apple's 30% commission and ZeroSettle's 5% fee. If courts allow Apple to impose, say, a 25% commission on external transactions, that spread compresses to nearly nothing. Building a company on a regulatory arbitrage that is being contested in real time isn't a structural inflection -- it's a bet on a specific legal outcome that the founders cannot influence. That's a miracle outside their control, which is fundamentally different from a miracle the team can engineer.

The "why now" here is real but it's the opposite of non-obvious. Every payments company with iOS exposure saw the Epic ruling. Within two months, Paddle ($1.4B valuation, $90M+ revenue) partnered with RevenueCat ($500M valuation, ~$20M ARR) to offer exactly this -- a combined iOS external payment and subscription management solution. Appcharge raised $58M in August 2025 for mobile gaming DTC payments. Neon raised $14M from Thrive Capital and a16z. Stripe published iOS payment processing documentation. This is a market with five well-funded competitors who all arrived before ZeroSettle entered the picture. When I think about the markets where I've made my best investments -- PagerDuty, Gusto, Checkr -- they all had something in common: other investors dismissed the opportunity as too small or too boring. Nobody is dismissing the iOS alternative billing opportunity. It's consensus, it's crowded, and the incumbents are well-positioned.

The competitive dynamics deserve scrutiny because they reveal a structural problem. ZeroSettle's differentiation is the integrated MoR function -- tax compliance across 190+ countries, chargebacks, fraud protection, pre-built paywalls. But Paddle already operates one of the largest MoR businesses for digital products globally. They have the infrastructure, the tax registrations, the fraud models trained on millions of transactions. When Paddle partners with RevenueCat, the "two vendor integration" friction ZeroSettle points to is real but marginal -- developers already use RevenueCat. A 2-person pre-seed startup competing on operational complexity against a $1.4B incumbent is fighting on the incumbent's strongest terrain. MoR is a scale business where more transaction volume yields better unit economics, better fraud detection, and more comprehensive tax compliance. This isn't like developer tools where a small team can out-iterate a large one. Compliance infrastructure rewards scale.

The strongest bull case: the founders are ex-Apple systems engineers with direct insider knowledge of iOS internals, StoreKit behavior, and App Store Review Guidelines. That's genuine founder-market fit -- they understand the platform at a level most payments companies don't. If the regulatory environment stabilizes favorably, and if Paddle's two-vendor integration proves enough of a friction point that independent developers prefer ZeroSettle's single SDK, there's a path to becoming embedded infrastructure. The Gusto analogy is tempting -- boring compliance work that becomes deeply embedded. And ZeroSettle's multi-platform coverage (Swift, React Native, Flutter) with 65 commits and 16 releases shows real execution velocity for a 2-person team. If I squint, I can see a world where this company captures the long tail of indie iOS developers who don't want to deal with Paddle's enterprise sales process. But that long tail generates small transaction volumes, and ZeroSettle's 5% + $0.50 pricing means they need substantial volume to build a real business.

The cryptocurrency tag and the "ZeroSettleEscrowKit" repo containing "all escrow and crypto sources" compound my concerns. A payments MoR company introducing crypto/escrow functionality is either unfocused product strategy or a sign that the founders aren't clear on their single miracle. Adding crypto to a payments product introduces money transmitter licensing requirements, securities considerations, and customer confusion about what the product actually is. When I apply the single-miracle test, ZeroSettle needs at least two miracles to succeed: the regulatory environment must stabilize in their favor (outside their control), and they must win meaningful developer adoption against incumbents with 100x their resources (difficult but possible). Two sequential low-probability events multiply, and the regulatory miracle is binary -- no amount of execution can influence a court ruling.

I'm passing. The structural moment is real but consensus, the regulatory foundation is contested, and the competitive landscape is dominated by well-funded incumbents who launched first. The founders have relevant domain expertise and have shipped real code, which I respect -- but domain knowledge and execution speed don't overcome a market structure where scale incumbents are already converging. This is a market where the adoption curve is visible to everyone, not a gap between perception and reality that only a few investors have mapped. The best version of ZeroSettle is a nice lifestyle business serving indie iOS developers. The path to becoming a generational company requires the regulatory stars to align AND out-distributing Paddle, and that's more miracles than I'm comfortable with.
