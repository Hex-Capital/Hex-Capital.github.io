# Carson -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Carson is competing with a company I already funded. Runlayer raised $11M from Khosla Ventures and Felicis last November, has signed eight unicorn and public-company customers including Gusto, Instacart, and Opendoor, and is attacking the identical problem -- making AI agents secure enough for enterprise deployment. The difference is architectural: Runlayer wraps existing agents in a governance layer, while Carson wants to build a full replacement agent with adaptive task-specific interfaces. But the thesis is the same thesis. If I believed the "secure enterprise AI agent" gap was worth a bet at scale, I already placed that bet, and I placed it on a team with demonstrated enterprise distribution, not a pre-launch waitlist. That alone should tell you something about where Carson sits in my framework.

But the deeper issue isn't portfolio conflict -- it's ambition calibration. Carson's tagline is "more capable than Cowork, more secure than OpenClaw." That's not a vision for how the world changes. That's a positioning statement defined by the gap between two existing products' weaknesses. When I backed Juniper, the thesis wasn't "faster than Cisco, cheaper than Bay Networks." It was: TCP/IP routing will replace the entire architecture of public telecommunications, and Cisco's CTO is wrong when he says it will never happen. Carson isn't declaring an incumbent system obsolete. They're declaring they occupy a more comfortable point on the capability-security tradeoff curve. If they succeed perfectly -- every enterprise adopts Carson -- the world has slightly more secure AI agents. Knowledge workers fill out slides and qualify leads with marginally less risk. That's a useful product. It might even be a billion-dollar SaaS company. But no industry is transformed. No physical system changes. The consequence of success is a good business in a market that Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, Salesforce, and ServiceNow are all converging on simultaneously.

The competitive dynamics are the sharpest version of this problem. Anthropic announced enterprise plugins and connectors for Cowork on February 24, 2026 -- literally the same moment Carson exists. Microsoft Copilot ships at $30/user/month with full M365 integration. Salesforce has Agentforce. ServiceNow absorbed Moveworks for $2.85 billion. The dossier itself states what I would have said: "security + adaptive UIs is a feature set, not a structural barrier." A four-person startup's feature set can be replicated by any of these incumbents in a quarter. Carson isn't building technology that makes the incumbent approach economically unviable -- they're building a feature bundle that the incumbents will absorb. That is the definition of a company that has reduced its probability of failure to the point where its success would be inconsequential.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that the underlying foundation models fully commoditize (making the interface layer the durable value), that Anthropic structurally cannot serve enterprise security needs due to its consumer-first incentives, and that Carson's adaptive UI approach is sufficiently superior to Runlayer's wrapper approach to win despite Runlayer's massive head start in enterprise distribution. If all three are true, Carson could capture the security-conscious enterprise segment in a market growing from $7.5 billion to $199 billion over a decade. The team has the right technical ingredients -- Palantir secure infrastructure experience across two founders, Robust Intelligence (acquired by Cisco for AI security) on Ketan's resume, Snowflake data-agent work. Milan's prior YC company Bolto shows he can ship product. These are competent people. But competent people executing a consensus playbook in a converging market is precisely the profile I pass on. The problem they've identified is real. The problem they've chosen to solve just isn't large enough or contrarian enough for my framework.

The team composition reinforces my concern. Three Harvard CS graduates and one Stanford CS graduate, drawing from Palantir, Snowflake, and Pinterest. These are insiders building from insider experience -- the antithesis of the outsider pattern that produced my best returns. Nobody on this team is approaching enterprise AI agents from a perspective that the industry considers crazy. Nobody is being told "that's impossible" by experts. The enterprise security community is actively asking for exactly what Carson is building -- CrowdStrike, Gartner, and every CISO in America is saying "we need secure AI agents." When the experts validate your thesis before you ship, that's a signal that the innovation is incremental enough to be non-threatening to the existing order. My best investments were in companies that incumbents mocked. Carson is building what incumbents are requesting.
