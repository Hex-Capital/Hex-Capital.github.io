# Overdrive Health -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Medical billing in America is a $250 billion administrative tax on a $4 trillion healthcare system. That fact alone should produce a company that rewires how providers get paid. Instead, Overdrive Health proposes to do the same thing existing billing companies do -- insurance discovery, eligibility verification, coding, claim submission, denial management -- but cheaper. "The best quality insurance and patient billing services for a fraction of the usual cost." I read that tagline and I already know my answer. If this succeeds brilliantly, the consequence is a profitable medical billing company in a market where CodaMetrix has raised $95 million, Cedar has raised $350 million at a $3.2 billion valuation, and every EHR vendor from Epic to Oracle is building native AI billing into their platform. The system itself -- CPT codes, payer adjudication, denial loops, the entire Rube Goldberg machine of American healthcare payments -- remains exactly as broken as it was before. Overdrive makes it 40% cheaper to operate the machine. It doesn't replace the machine.

This is precisely the kind of bet where founders have de-risked their way into irrelevance. The market is real, the technology works, the team has relevant experience. And the consequence of success is inconsequential at the scale I care about. A truly ambitious attack on healthcare billing would ask: why does this billing system exist at all? Why are we training AI to generate CPT codes instead of eliminating the need for CPT codes? The founders came from EliseAI -- a healthcare AI company -- and saw the billing problem up close. That proximity gave them pattern recognition but also gave them the industry's frame of reference. They're optimizing inside the box rather than asking whether the box should exist. Industry insiders executing the industry's playbook is one of my clearest anti-patterns.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. LLMs have crossed a real capability threshold for processing medical documentation -- GPT-4 class models can interpret clinical notes, map to billing codes, and draft appeals with a competence that was science fiction three years ago. Healthcare staffing shortages, particularly in billing departments, create genuine demand pull. Traditional billing outsourcers face a classic innovator's dilemma: their revenue depends on headcount, so adopting AI cannibalizes their own economics. EHR vendors sell software licenses and resist building managed service operations. There is a structural window for an AI-native managed billing service that combines technology automation with service delivery. If Overdrive executes well, captures thousands of small practices, accumulates proprietary payer-response data across specialties, and builds real switching costs, they could build a substantial business -- perhaps a $500 million revenue company at maturity. That's a meaningful outcome for some investors. It's not the kind of outcome I write checks for.

The timing is consensus, which is itself a warning. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was "laughable" -- that's why the bet was available. When I backed cleantech in 2004, VCs were running away from anything physical. The signal I look for is top talent flowing into a space before the crowd notices. AI-powered medical billing is the opposite: CodaMetrix, Sift Healthcare, Hank AI, and a dozen others all launched in the same 2022-2025 window. EHR vendors are actively building competing capabilities. The experts aren't dismissing this -- they're all doing it. When incumbents and well-funded startups validate your approach rather than mocking it, you're probably building something incremental enough to be non-threatening. The competitive moat here is thin: "the core components (coding AI, eligibility verification APIs, claim submission) are becoming increasingly available through off-the-shelf tools and APIs." No patents, no proprietary datasets, no published technical differentiation. The defensibility story is future data accumulation, which is a hypothesis every AI billing startup tells itself.

The founders are competent -- Inge has Harvard CS, Jane Street quantitative rigor, and EliseAI healthcare AI experience; Schroeder brings operations automation across real estate and recruiting plus the same EliseAI background. They clearly know how to build AI agents for complex service workflows. But competence directed at an incremental problem doesn't produce transformational outcomes. Two technical founders from the same employer, with similar skill sets, targeting a managed service business that will require heavy sales, operations, and compliance infrastructure -- the gene pool isn't engineered for the venture's actual risks. The critical challenges here are provider sales cycles, trust barriers with risk-averse medical practices, and regulatory compliance under HIPAA and the False Claims Act. Neither founder's background maps to those challenges.

I pass. These founders are too capable to spend their careers making medical billing 40% cheaper. The problem worth solving in healthcare payments is not "how do we process claims faster" but "how do we eliminate the need for this entire administrative apparatus." That company would terrify me -- and that's the one I'd fund.
