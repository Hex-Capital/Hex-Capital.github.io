# Travo -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what jumps out immediately: Travo is an AI-powered SaaS data platform. That's three of my least favorite words in a single product description. The pitch is using AI to collect, aggregate, and analyze real estate data for niche asset classes, starting with RV parks. Apply my most basic filter -- would this business be good if AI didn't exist? -- and the answer is clearly no. Without AI, this is manual data collection from county assessor records and zoning databases, which is exactly what brokers already do with interns and spreadsheets. The AI isn't a cherry on top of a fundamentally sound business. The AI *is* the business. And that means every improvement in generally available AI models -- every new scraping framework, every better LLM for structured data extraction -- makes it cheaper for anyone else to replicate what Travo is building. This is a feature waiting to be absorbed, not a company with structural staying power.

The sane-person-insane-idea test produces a lukewarm reading here. Four Stanford CS undergrads -- smart, clearly capable, one prior exit in education, one with Wachtell legal experience, one ex-Roblox. These are credentialed generalists, and I don't mean that as a compliment in this context. None of them have documented real estate experience. None come from the RV park investment world, from a commercial real estate shop, from a title company, from anywhere that would give them proprietary insight into why this data is hard to collect or what makes it valuable to the buyer. The "sane" part of the equation is generic technical competence, not specific domain credibility. And the "insane" part -- building data tools for RV park investors -- isn't actually insane. It's just small. Nobody dismisses this as crazy; they dismiss it as niche. There's a critical difference between an idea that provokes genuine disbelief and one that provokes a polite "interesting, good luck." The best version of my framework requires both halves to be strong. Here, neither half is particularly compelling.

The moat question is where this really falls apart for me. Travo's defensibility story is that they'll build a proprietary dataset for niche asset classes before anyone else does, and the dataset itself becomes the moat. I've heard this story a hundred times, and it was a reasonable pitch five years ago. Today, AI is precisely the technology that destroys data-aggregation moats. The cost of scraping county records, parsing zoning documents, and structuring rental comps is collapsing toward zero as models improve. If a well-funded competitor -- or frankly, a motivated PE analyst with Claude and a weekend -- can replicate your core data pipeline, you don't have a moat. You have a head start, and head starts are not the same thing as defensible positions. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is actual painting crews showing up at actual houses. You cannot replicate that with an API call. Travo has no physical infrastructure, no regulatory position, no protocol-layer lock-in, no network effects. The software IS the business, and software moats are dissolving faster than founders realize.

The strongest bull case, and I want to engage with it honestly: if Travo becomes "CoStar for everything CoStar ignores," that's a legitimate narrative with real scale potential. The incumbents -- Reonomy, Cherre, Crexi -- genuinely don't serve niche asset classes because the unit economics don't justify it for their large institutional customers. There's a structural gap in the market. Institutional capital is flowing into alternative assets as mainstream CRE yields compress. RV park cap rates of 8-12% attract real money, and those investors genuinely lack centralized data tools. If Travo nails RV parks and then expands to mobile home parks, marinas, self-storage facilities, campgrounds -- each with its own fragmented data landscape -- the compounding effect of multi-vertical coverage could create something meaningful. The expansion narrative from "one niche" to "the data layer for all underserved asset classes" has legitimate elasticity. But this bull case requires me to believe that a data-aggregation business built by domain outsiders will compound faster than AI commoditizes data aggregation itself, and I simply don't believe that. The timing is backwards: they're building a data moat at exactly the moment AI is making data moats worthless.

There's also no new primitive being created here. Travo isn't establishing a protocol or standard that others build on. It's an application sitting on top of public data sources, adding a convenience layer of AI-powered structuring. Nobody else's product gets better because Travo exists. Nobody integrates Travo as infrastructure. This caps the theoretical ceiling in a way that matters to me -- applications get absorbed or outcompeted; primitives compound. The narrative can stretch to "all niche asset classes," sure, but the structural position remains application-layer throughout that expansion.

The absence of any traction signal -- no revenue, no users, no demonstrated demand -- combined with no domain expertise and a business model that maps directly onto the SaaS subscription pattern I've been publicly arguing is dying... this is a clean pass. Smart kids, real gap in the market, but the wrong structural approach to filling it. If one of these founders had spent five years running an RV park brokerage and then decided to build the data tool they wished existed, with the AI as a "cherry on top" of deep operator knowledge, I'd look twice. That would be a sane person with domain credibility pursuing something contrarian. Instead, this is four CS students applying AI to a market they found, which is a perfectly fine YC project but not where I'm writing checks from my own account.
