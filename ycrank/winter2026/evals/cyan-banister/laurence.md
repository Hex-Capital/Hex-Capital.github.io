# Laurence -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Laurence: it's a company built by two people with impeccable resumes -- Cornell, Google, Meta, BCG, Jump Trading -- applying quantitative trading techniques to Amazon advertising bids. And look, the Jump Trading pedigree is real. That's one of the most selective quant firms on the planet. The intellectual transfer from stochastic optimization in financial markets to advertising bid management is genuinely clever. Leo Gierhake's professional poker career -- $250K in winnings, which means countless hours making decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information -- maps almost perfectly onto what they're building. I respect the technical insight. But when I sit with this, I keep asking myself: where's the story? Not the business case, not the technical architecture -- the *story*. How did these two founders arrive at a burning need to fix Amazon PPC advertising? What I see in the dossier is a skill looking for a market, not a wound looking for a salve. Matthew Chen went from Cornell to BCG to Jump to Google to Meta -- that's the resume of someone who has had doors opened for them at every turn. That's not a criticism of his character, but it tells me something about what's driving this company. When I backed the Crusoe team, or when I wrote my first check to SpaceX, there was an almost irrational personal commitment to a problem that the founders couldn't *not* solve. I don't feel that current running through Laurence.

The category itself gives me pause for a different reason. Applying machine learning to advertising optimization is possibly the single most consensus application of AI in 2026. Every major tech company, every ad platform, every marketing SaaS tool is racing to do some version of this. Laurence's specific approach -- RL-based stochastic optimization versus rule-based thresholds -- is a meaningful technical distinction, and I believe it probably produces better outcomes. But "better ML for ads" is not the kind of idea that makes people uncomfortable. Nobody is going to tell these founders they're crazy. Nobody is going to pass on them because the idea is too weird. And that's actually the problem for me. The most promising companies I've backed were ones where I had to convince *myself* it wasn't insane -- SpaceX, Uber when it was literally illegal, Contraline making male contraceptive gel. The discomfort is the signal. When the pitch makes perfect sense to every investor in the room, the upside has usually already been priced in by the market.

I want to be honest about the bull case, because it's real. These founders have $10M in live ad spend under management, roughly 11 named clients, and they're claiming 40% reductions in advertising cost of sales. At pre-seed, that's meaningful traction -- not just a prototype, but real money flowing through real campaigns for real businesses. If the RL approach genuinely delivers those results at scale, the data flywheel could become formidable: more ad spend managed means more conversion data, which means better models, which means better results, which attracts more customers. Amazon's advertising market is $56 billion and growing 20% a year. The incumbents -- Pacvue, Teikametrics, Quartile -- were all built on rule-based architectures, and rearchitecting around RL would mean rewriting their core bidding engines while serving existing customers. That's the kind of technical debt that lets a startup run for a few years before the giants catch up. If I were evaluating purely on founder competence and market opportunity, this would look quite good.

But I don't evaluate that way, and I've learned not to apologize for it. What I'm missing here is any sense that this company makes something invisible visible, or creates economic access for people who don't currently have it. Laurence helps existing Amazon sellers optimize their existing ad spend -- that's value creation, but it's optimization for people already inside the system, not a doorway for people currently locked out. When I invested in Uber, I saw a poverty-alleviation tool for drivers. When I backed Affirm, I saw transparent credit replacing predatory hidden fees. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that had none. Laurence makes Amazon sellers slightly more profitable. That's a business, and it might be a good one, but it doesn't give me that jolt of energy I've learned to trust -- that feeling that a company is going to change who gets access to what.

The platform dependency concern also sits heavy with me. Everything Laurence does runs through Amazon's Advertising API. Amazon has repeatedly demonstrated willingness to restrict third-party access when it competes with its own tools. This isn't a regulated space where navigating complexity creates a durable moat -- it's a platform dependency where the moat belongs to someone else, and that someone else has every incentive to build their own RL-based bidding optimization. The co-founder dynamic looks healthy on paper -- shared Jump Trading background, clean CEO/Chief Scientist split -- but I don't have enough signal on how they handle real adversity together. The shared employer origin is encouraging, and I don't see red flags, but it's thin evidence for the kind of resilience I need to see.

This is a technically strong team building a legitimate product in a large market with real early traction. I think there's a reasonable chance it becomes a solid mid-sized SaaS company. But nothing about it matches the way I invest. There's no biographical grit driving a personal mission, no anti-consensus weirdness that scares away other investors, no economic access creation for underserved populations, and no structural complexity creating a regulatory moat. It's a smart bet for someone whose framework rewards technical competence and market timing. It's not a bet I would make with my own money.
