# Return Signals -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This company is the platonic ideal of what I pass on. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The core capability -- outbound SMS with an LLM-powered conversational agent -- is technically reproducible. Any team with access to large language models, SMS APIs, and Shopify integration could build a competing product." I don't usually get to quote a company's own research as my investment thesis against them, but there it is. Return Signals is an AI-first product where AI constitutes the entire value proposition. Strip away the LLM and you have a call center sending text messages. My "cherry on top" test asks: would this business be compelling if AI didn't exist? The answer here isn't "less compelling" -- it's "nonexistent." That's not a business; that's a feature sitting on top of three other companies' platforms waiting to get absorbed.

The founder-idea calibration is off in a specific way that's instructive. Ilya Valmianski is genuinely credible -- a PhD physicist who built SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest patient-facing ML deployments in healthcare, trained on 25 million primary care encounters. That's real operator credibility in conversational AI at scale. The "sane person" signal is legitimate. But the idea isn't insane -- it's obvious. Every e-commerce operator hears "AI that proactively contacts customers to convert returns into exchanges" and nods immediately. Nobody's confused by this. Nobody thinks it's crazy. That means the insight has already been priced in, and what you're betting on is execution speed against Loop Returns ($176M raised, 5,000+ brands), Narvar ($64M raised, 74 billion consumer interactions through their IRIS AI layer), and AfterShip ($85M in revenue). Those incumbents already have the merchant relationships, the post-purchase data, and the engineering teams to add proactive SMS outreach as a feature update, not a new product. I need the founder's domain expertise to match the specific problem, and Ilya's expertise is healthcare -- he pivoted from MDandMe, a healthcare AI symptom checker that raised $2M in mid-2023 and appears to have been abandoned. That trajectory -- credentialed founder pivoting away from their domain into a hot market -- is more "sane person, sensible idea" than "sane person, insane idea."

The structural moat question is where this falls apart completely for me. I've spent the last two years arguing that software moats are dissolving because AI commoditizes development faster than it creates defensible value. Return Signals is a software company whose moat IS AI -- it's not just exposed to the commoditization dynamic, it's entirely constituted by it. The company is an application layer built on Shopify's commerce infrastructure, Twilio's SMS pipes, and whatever LLM provider powers the conversations. Three layers of platform dependency with no physical infrastructure, no protocol position, no regulatory moat, no network effect. The claimed data moat -- "proprietary post-purchase conversational patterns and product-issue taxonomies" -- is theoretical at their current scale of maybe 5,000 check-ins, while Narvar is processing 74 billion interactions annually. You don't out-data a company with four orders of magnitude more interactions by being slightly more focused on returns.

Let me steel-man the bull case, because there is one worth articulating. If Return Signals establishes itself as the category creator for proactive post-purchase engagement -- not reactive returns processing but genuine anticipatory intervention -- and if the 70% exchange conversion rate holds at scale with real merchants, they could build an extremely sticky product with measurable ROI (the claimed 5-10% margin uplift is the kind of number that makes CFOs write checks). The conversational AI expertise Ilya built at Kaiser -- handling nuanced, empathetic, high-stakes patient conversations -- is arguably more transferable to post-purchase troubleshooting than most ML backgrounds. And incumbents are structurally conflicted: Loop, Narvar, and AfterShip make money processing returns, so a product that eliminates returns before they enter the pipeline potentially cannibalizes their core revenue stream. That incumbent conflict is real and creates a window. But the window is narrow -- it requires Return Signals to achieve meaningful market penetration before any incumbent decides the strategic value of proactive intervention outweighs the revenue cannibalization, and history suggests incumbents make that calculation faster than startups can scale.

The narrative ceiling is also lower than it might appear. "AI concierge for post-purchase engagement" could theoretically expand into a broader conversational commerce layer, but that expansion path runs directly into Gorgias, Zendesk, Intercom, and eventually Shopify itself. The SMS channel dependency adds another constraint -- the company is betting its core engagement mechanism on a channel that's simultaneously growing (projected $10B by 2030) and becoming noisier as every brand adds SMS marketing. The 74% response rate they show on their website is impressive if real, but SMS response rates for commercial messages have been declining industry-wide as the channel gets saturated. And the regulatory surface area for outbound commercial SMS is expanding, not contracting.

I'd rather fund a returns company that owns physical infrastructure -- think Happy Returns' drop-off network, which UPS bought for exactly this reason -- than one whose entire defensibility depends on having a slightly better prompt engineering setup than what Loop's AI team will ship next quarter. The aspiring pirate in me wants to see businesses that get stronger as software gets cheaper, and this one gets weaker.
