# End Close -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Sean Bolton spent six years building the reconciliation infrastructure at Modern Treasury that processes over a trillion dollars in annual payments. He wrote about reconciliation algorithms as knapsack problems. He built an open-source project for syncing with QuickBooks and Xero. And now he's left to build the standalone version of what he spent years building inside someone else's company. This is the pattern I pay the most attention to -- a founder who didn't go looking for a startup idea but rather couldn't stop working on a problem that had been consuming him for half a decade. Bolton knows every edge case in payment matching at scale because he personally encountered them. That kind of knowledge isn't something you acquire from market research. It accumulates through years of debugging transactions at three in the morning.

The schlep here is genuine and deep. Payment reconciliation sounds boring, and that's exactly the point. It involves dealing with dozens of bank file formats, regulatory audit requirements, the operational misery of exception handling where a human has to pull context from six different systems to figure out why one transaction doesn't match. This is precisely the kind of problem that smart engineers unconsciously filter out. They'd rather build another AI copilot. Every programmer who has worked near payment infrastructure knows reconciliation is painful, but almost none of them wake up and decide to solve it. Bolton is one of the rare people who already did the schlep -- inside Modern Treasury -- and is now betting he can do it better as a focused product. That's a close cousin to how Stripe happened. The Collisons didn't discover that payments were broken from reading a blog post. They'd been wrestling with it themselves.

David Newell's trajectory adds a signal I value. His first company, Unflow, raised two million and shut down. He went to PostHog, built their error tracking product -- described as the fastest-growing product in PostHog's history -- and now he's back at YC for a second time. I funded Emmett Shear after Kiko failed and was sold on eBay for $258K. He came back and built Twitch. Founders who have been through a startup death and come back aren't traumatized -- they're calibrated. They know what failure looks like, so they make different decisions. Newell's infrastructure engineering background at PostHog and Intercom also complements Bolton's domain depth. Both founders are engineers who build things. The CTO isn't a title on a deck -- he ships product.

The competitive tension with Modern Treasury is the most interesting risk here and also, paradoxically, a validation of the idea. Modern Treasury bundles reconciliation into a broader payments operating system. You have to be on their rails to use it. End Close positions as a standalone layer that sits on top of whatever stack you already have. That's a real architectural wedge. When a well-funded company bundles a feature and a startup unbundles it as a dedicated product, the startup often wins the segment that cares most about that specific capability. But Bolton has to execute fast because Modern Treasury knows this market intimately -- partly because he taught them. The window exists because legacy players like BlackLine and Trintech are structurally oriented toward batch processing and CFO buyers, and Modern Treasury is structurally oriented toward customers already on its payment rails. End Close targets the gap: real-time, API-first, works with any existing stack.

The honest gap in my evaluation is traction. There is none publicly visible. No revenue signal, no customer names, no waitlist data. At pre-seed this isn't disqualifying, but it means I'm betting entirely on the organic problem-market fit and the founders' ability to execute. The bull case -- what would make this a great investment -- is that Bolton's domain expertise gives End Close a cold-start advantage that typically takes competitors years to develop, that the developer-API-first positioning enables a product-led motion that bypasses long enterprise sales cycles, and that the AI exception-resolution agent creates a genuine data flywheel as it processes more exception types. If those three things converge, this could be the Stripe of reconciliation -- the company that makes everyone say "why didn't someone just do this already?" The answer, as usual, is that the schlep scared them off.

This is a B2B infrastructure play built by technical founders with deep domain expertise, targeting a problem that's been hiding behind the wall of financial plumbing where most engineers never look. That combination -- developer tools, genuine schlep, organic discovery -- is exactly the category where YC companies tend to compound quietly until they're suddenly enormous. My hesitation is purely about the missing evidence of user pull and the shadow of Modern Treasury. But the origin story is among the strongest I've seen. Bolton didn't think up this idea. He lived inside it for six years.
