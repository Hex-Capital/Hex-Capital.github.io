# DroneTector -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The counter-drone market is not a non-obvious market. Grand View Research, MarketsandMarkets, and Fortune Business Insights all publish reports sizing it at $2.5-4.5 billion today with 20-27% CAGRs. Robin Radar generated €43 million in revenue in 2023. DroneShield posted $57.5 million in FY2024. Dedrone was acquired by Axon. Fortem Technologies just won a multimillion-dollar FIFA World Cup contract. When three separate market research firms are publishing TAM estimates and four funded competitors are already generating tens of millions in revenue, the structural moment has already been recognized — and largely captured. I look for markets where other investors see "too boring" or "too niche" and miss the inflection. Counter-drone detection in 2026 is the opposite: every defense-focused investor in the world knows this market is real. The question is whether there's a non-obvious layer within this consensus market that hasn't been addressed.

The potential non-obvious angle is nano-drone detection specifically — the $50 drones that blend in with birds. If existing systems genuinely can't see these targets, and DroneTector's 94 GHz millimeter-wave approach is the only technology that can, then there's a real subsegment at an inflection point. The CEO's PhD at St Andrews was literally on "94 GHz Doppler radar for experimental validation of small UAV micro-Doppler signatures" — you rarely see founder-market fit this precise. His research was co-funded by QinetiQ, a major UK defense contractor, so the technology has already been vetted by an institutional buyer. The enabling "why now" has some substance: millimeter-wave components originally developed for automotive radar and 5G have driven down costs, making it feasible for a three-person team to build custom high-frequency radar at price points that were impossible five years ago. That's a legitimate cost curve crossing a threshold. But Robin Radar already pioneered micro-Doppler drone detection and has 200+ radar units deployed in Ukraine — the dossier says they operate at "lower frequencies," which means the differentiation comes down to degree of resolution on the smallest targets, not a categorical capability gap. That's a performance improvement, not a new market.

Here's what gives me real pause: this is a multi-miracle company. They need to (1) demonstrate that 94 GHz radar provides performance on nano drones that's categorically better than what Robin Radar does at lower frequencies, (2) build production-quality hardware from a prototype, (3) navigate defense procurement cycles of 12-36 months, (4) scale manufacturing for specialized millimeter-wave components, and (5) win contracts against competitors with established relationships and deployed systems. That's four or five miracles, and compounding low-probability events is how you get to near-zero. When I invested in Anduril, the structural situation was fundamentally different: Google's Project Maven cancellation had created a vacuum — there was no credible defense AI startup. DroneTector faces the opposite: a crowded field with scaled, well-funded competitors who already have deployed systems and revenue.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is structurally limited. A radar unit is a physical product sold through defense procurement — it doesn't naturally become a distribution channel for additional products the way Stripe's API became the distribution channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Each sale is a discrete, long-cycle procurement event. You could imagine adding software analytics or integrating with counter-measure systems over time, but the core business model is hardware sales plus maintenance contracts. That's a margin structure that looks more like my "software-aware" pattern than "software-driven." Defense radar companies can build excellent businesses, but they rarely become the platform companies that generate 100x returns.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: that nano drones are about to become the dominant threat vector (shifting budget toward detection systems optimized for the smallest targets), that 94 GHz millimeter-wave is the only frequency band that works for this class of target (creating a categorical rather than incremental advantage), and that DroneTector can navigate from PhD research to production hardware and defense contracts faster than Robin Radar can move up-frequency or Fortem can add millimeter-wave capability to their existing platform. If all three are true, DroneTector occupies a real structural niche — the Gusto of nano-drone detection, the "boring" subsegment that everyone overlooks because Robin Radar and DroneShield appear to have the market covered. The NATO DIANA participation and DASA support are genuine distribution signals in this direction. But I'd need evidence that existing systems are actually failing on nano drones in operational environments — not just that 94 GHz is theoretically better, but that Ukrainian or NATO operators are hitting detection gaps that DroneTector's approach specifically addresses. Without that evidence, this is a technology thesis looking for market validation, not a market pull looking for the right technology.

The founders are all straight from PhD programs with no prior startup experience. The CTO's concurrent involvement with Quantum Fabrix is a concern on a three-person team — when one-third of your engineering capacity might be diverted, that's not a soft issue. The company was incorporated in November 2023 and I see no evidence of shipped product, revenue, or customer deployments — just program participation and pitch competitions. I respect the RAEng Enterprise Fellowship selection, but defense tech companies need founders who can navigate procurement bureaucracies, build manufacturing relationships, and close contracts, not just publish papers. I've seen too many deep-tech academic spinouts that have brilliant technology but stall in the "valley of death" between prototype and production.

I pass. The structural moment is real — Ukraine has permanently elevated counter-drone spending. But the market is consensus, the competitive landscape is already populated with well-funded incumbents, the company requires multiple sequential miracles, and the hardware business model limits the upside trajectory I need from an angel investment. If the team can demonstrate categorical nano-drone detection superiority in operational environments and secure initial procurement contracts, this could become interesting at a later stage when the multi-miracle risk has been partially resolved.
