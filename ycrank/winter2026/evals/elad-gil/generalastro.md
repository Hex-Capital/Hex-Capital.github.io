# General Astronautics -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about General Astronautics is that the business plan requires at least three sequential miracles. They need to design and flight-qualify robotic hardware for the space environment -- thermal, radiation, vibration, vacuum testing that typically takes years and tens of millions of dollars. They need commercial space stations to actually get built and become operational, since their primary customers (Axiom, Vast, Orbital Reef) are still in development. And they need microgravity manufacturing to prove economically viable at a scale that justifies dedicated robotic labor infrastructure. Each of those is independently uncertain. Together, they compound to very low odds. I've written explicitly about this: when a startup requires more than one miracle, you have compounding small odds and that means you're very likely to fail. General Astronautics needs three miracles, none of which they fully control.

The "why now" question is where this investment falls apart for me. When I invested in Harvey, I could trace a specific capability curve -- the GPT-2 to GPT-3 jump, extrapolated forward -- and see that model fidelity for legal work was 12-18 months away. The structural moment was precise and imminent. Here, the structural argument is that commercial space stations are "entering development" and launch costs are declining. Both are true, but neither represents a specific threshold being crossed right now. The ISS is expected to deorbit around 2030. Axiom, Vast, and Orbital Reef are years from operational readiness. The microgravity manufacturing market is projected at $1.33 billion today, growing to $23.3 billion by 2035 -- which means the real market is a decade out. This is a 2029-2031 opportunity being pursued in 2026 with pre-seed capital. I've seen this pattern before with VR/AR circa 2015 and cleantech circa 2008 -- the thesis was directionally correct, but the timing gap between "this will be important" and "this is investable now" destroyed most early entrants. Correct idea, premature execution window.

The competitive landscape reinforces the timing concern. GITAI has raised $60.5 million and already demonstrated dual-arm autonomous operations outside the ISS. Redwire has $304 million in annual revenue and eight years of in-orbit manufacturing operations on the ISS. These aren't distant incumbents -- they're active players with flight heritage, which in space robotics is the defining moat. Once a system is qualified and demonstrated in orbit, the qualification burden for competitors is enormous. General Astronautics is entering a market where the leaders already have the most critical asset -- proven space operations -- and where the capital requirements to catch up are vastly beyond pre-seed scale. This isn't the Stripe pattern, where a better developer API could disrupt clunky incumbent payment rails with software. Space hardware qualification is a physical, irreducible barrier where money and time are prerequisites, not just engineering cleverness.

The strongest bull case would be this: if Starship delivers another 10x reduction in launch costs, and if the founders secure early partnerships with a commercial station operator before that operator has locked in a robotics vendor, General Astronautics could become the default robotic platform for the post-ISS era. The founders bring relevant credentials -- Schork's SpaceX hardware reliability experience on Starlink lasers and Zhou's Carnegie Mellon robotics background are genuinely complementary for this problem. And in theory, a standardized robotic platform for space stations could become a distribution channel for manufacturing-as-a-service, maintenance, and experimentation -- a platform play with real expansion potential. That's a version of the Stripe story: start as robotic infrastructure, become the platform through which all microgravity economic activity flows. But that vision requires successfully navigating the multi-miracle gauntlet first, and it requires the market to materialize on a timeline compatible with their capital constraints. Hardware companies burning through cash while waiting for their market to arrive is a pattern that has destroyed far better-funded startups than this one.

I'm also applying my "software-driven versus software-aware" filter here. The autonomy stack and AI capabilities are real differentiators in principle, but the core business is building and deploying physical hardware in the most unforgiving environment possible. The margin structure, capital requirements, and iteration speed all look like a hardware company, not a software platform. NVIDIA Inception membership signals they're investing in the AI/autonomy layer, which is encouraging, but the binding constraint isn't software capability -- it's space qualification, launch access, and customer platform availability. The software is a feature of the hardware business, not the engine that drives compounding returns. This doesn't make it a "smart toaster" -- space autonomy is legitimately hard and valuable -- but it does mean the return profile looks more like aerospace hardware than the infrastructure software plays where I've had my best outcomes.
