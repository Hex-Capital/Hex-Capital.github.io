# DAIVIN! -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most interesting thing about DAIVIN! is a single sentence from the YC page: oxygen supply is "fundamentally an energy problem, not a gas logistics problem." That's a first-principles reframe of the kind I've spent forty years funding. Compressed gas has defined underwater breathing for a century — every tank, every fill station, every exotic helium mix, every depth limitation is a consequence of treating breathable gas as a supply chain problem rather than an energy conversion problem. If Leo Kankkunen is right that portable electrolysis can generate oxygen on demand from the water you're swimming in, he hasn't built better dive gear — he's obsoleted the entire infrastructure that diving depends on. The compressed gas ecosystem — manufacturing, distribution, fill stations, gas-mix logistics — becomes as relevant as the horse feed supply chain after Ford.

But I've learned the hard way that elegant physics doesn't guarantee viable engineering. This is where my KiOR scar tissue activates. KiOR could convert biomass to fuel — the chemistry was sound, the concept was transformational. What killed it was the gap between "it works" and "it works at a cost and scale that displaces the incumbent." DAIVIN! claims 200 meters of depth with on-demand electrolysis from a battery-powered vest. No third-party testing. No independent validation. No public evidence the system has been tested beyond what the founder has personally built. The energy required to electrolyze enough water to sustain human respiration at depth is not trivial — a resting diver consumes roughly 0.5 liters of oxygen per minute, and at 200 meters the physics get substantially harder. Can a wearable battery pack deliver the energy density needed? Maybe, with today's lithium-ion improvements. But "maybe" is exactly where KiOR was when I wrote a $160 million check. The hydrogen byproduct — explosive gas generated inches from a breathing oxygen supply underwater — is a safety engineering challenge that no amount of redundancy hand-waving resolves without rigorous testing.

The consequence magnitude, if this truly works across all claimed applications, is meaningful but not civilization-scale. The scuba equipment market is $1-2 billion. The broader self-contained breathing apparatus market adds $5 billion. Defense applications add more. If you're generous and include firefighting, space, mining, and military special operations, you might construct a $10-15 billion addressable opportunity. That's worth pursuing — I funded Rocket Lab in a market that wasn't obviously huge at inception — but it's not replacing animal agriculture or achieving fusion energy. The world operates somewhat differently if dive gear changes; it doesn't fundamentally restructure a trillion-dollar system. Where this gets more interesting is if on-demand oxygen generation becomes a platform technology — a capability that enables things we haven't imagined, the way GPS enabled Uber. But that's a second-order bet on optionality, not a direct consequence calculation.

The outsider pattern is present and genuine. A Finnish electrical engineer — youngest in his country to earn the highest voltage certification — attacking a domain where every incumbent is locked into pneumatic and mechanical engineering traditions. This is structurally similar to what I saw with Peter Beck at Rocket Lab: someone from outside the establishment, from a small country, bringing a different engineering discipline to an old problem. Kankkunen's electrical engineering background maps directly to the core challenge — electrolysis is fundamentally an electrochemical and power management problem, not a diving problem. His military background gives him credibility with defense buyers. The "two-time founder" mention is intriguing but unverifiable. What I can't assess from this dossier is learning rate — has his thinking evolved rapidly during YC? Has he abandoned assumptions? Without direct interaction, I'm left with the credentials, which are relevant but not a substitute for watching someone think.

The timing trajectory is the strongest bull case element. Battery energy density has roughly doubled since 2010. PEM electrolyzer costs are declining with the hydrogen economy buildout. Helium prices have increased 400-1000% since 2000, making traditional deep-dive gas mixes increasingly expensive. Defense budgets are growing for portable autonomous systems. These are real, measurable, converging trends that make portable electrolysis more feasible now than at any point in history. If I apply my "skate to where the puck will be" framework, the puck — battery density sufficient for wearable electrolysis — may arrive in the next three to five years even if it's not quite there today.

My deepest concern is the solo founder building multi-disciplinary hardware. I've invested in solo founders before — Pat Brown at Impossible Foods was one person. But Brown was solving a single hard problem (plant-based heme) and could recruit specialists around it. DAIVIN! requires simultaneous expertise in electrochemistry, membrane technology, mechanical engineering, embedded systems, underwater pressure physics, safety certification, and defense procurement. A team size of one across all of these disciplines, with no publicly identified advisors or technical co-founders, is not a red flag I can dismiss with redundancy claims about the circuitry. The circuitry might be quadruple-redundant; the team is zero-redundant. If Kankkunen gets hit by a bus — or simply burns out — the entire venture evaporates. I'd want to see a co-founder with complementary skills before committing capital beyond what YC provides.

This is a bet I find intellectually compelling but not yet investable at my threshold. The first-principles reframe is real. The outsider pattern is present. The timing convergence is favorable. But the consequence magnitude, while meaningful, doesn't reach the scale where I override all other concerns. And the KiOR lesson is too expensive to forget: when someone tells me their technology works at specifications no one has independently verified, in an application where failure means someone drowns, I need more than elegant physics and triple redundancy claims. I'd tell Leo: find a technical co-founder who's spent a decade in electrochemistry or fuel cell engineering. Get a third-party lab to validate oxygen generation rates at depth. Then come back and show me the data. The problem is worth attacking — but one person, with unvalidated claims, isn't yet the investment I'd make with my own money.
