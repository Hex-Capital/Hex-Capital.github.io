# Seeing Systems -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my problem with Seeing Systems: building autonomous strike drones for NATO in 2026 is the least contrarian thing you can do in European tech right now. Germany just wrote checks worth €900M for twelve thousand kamikaze drones. Helsing is at €12 billion. The European Commission is calling for a "once-in-a-generation surge" in defense investment with drones listed as a top priority. Every limited partner on earth wants defense exposure. When I look at this company through my core filter — is this a sane person with an insane idea? — I get sane people with the sanest possible idea. Two credible brothers from Guernsey building exactly what every government in Europe is publicly begging startups to build. That's not where I find alpha. When the opportunity is this obvious, the returns get competed away before the first production contract ships.

Now, the founders themselves activate real signals for me. Alexander and Matthew Le Maitre are brothers — not co-founders who met at a hackathon, but people with the kind of relational depth that survives genuine adversity. The hardware-software split between them is clean and earned: Alexander designed EOD training and diagnostic hardware at Wildcat I.S. that's used by NATO forces, Special Forces, and European military units today. Matthew came out of Cambridge CS top of his class and cut his teeth at Jane Street, which is about as rigorous a software environment as exists. Alexander's Wildcat background is the real asset here — he's already earned trust with the exact customers Seeing Systems is selling to, and that trust is why they have UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces engaged at the prototype stage. For a two-person team with $500K, having military units actively providing iterative feedback on your hardware is genuinely remarkable. Defense procurement relationships take years to build and are nearly impossible to fake.

The physical-world moat characteristics are exactly the pattern I gravitate toward — I backed Seneca doing autonomous aerial wildfire suppression and Craftwork running painting crews with a tech layer. Defense hardware has operational complexity that pure software companies cannot replicate: manufacturing to military spec, supply chain security, field testing, integration with existing doctrine. Defense procurement switching costs are real and compounding — once a platform is adopted, tested, and woven into operational procedures, displacing it is enormously expensive. This is structurally the kind of business I want to invest in. But here's where my "cherry on top" test creates friction: the agentic AI control system isn't the cherry — it IS the sundae. Strip out the autonomous AI capability and you have a modular drone hardware company competing against much better-capitalized hardware manufacturers with no particular edge. The AI component is what differentiates Seeing Systems from commodity drone hardware, which means the core value proposition lives in exactly the domain where Shield AI ($5.3B, building Hivemind autonomy software) and Helsing (dedicating billions to AI-driven military systems) are concentrating massive resources.

The bull case is real and I want to articulate it honestly. If I imagine the world where Seeing Systems wins, it looks like this: the Le Maitres' existing military relationships convert from prototype feedback loops into initial production contracts with UK forces. European NATO allies, burned by dependency on US defense primes and alarmed by Stark's trial failures, specifically seek smaller, more agile domestic suppliers who can iterate rapidly. The modular hardware architecture — swap components without redesigning the whole platform — proves genuinely superior in field conditions where electronic warfare threats evolve weekly. Seeing Systems becomes the low-cost, fast-iteration alternative that fills the gap between expensive Anduril/Helsing platforms and commodity Chinese drones that NATO can't touch for security reasons. In that world, this is the Anduril of Europe at the ground floor, and the $500K YC check looks like Solana at five cents. The narrative magnitude is legitimately infinite: low-cost strike drones → autonomous military systems → sovereign defense operating system. European sovereignty in defense is a trillion-dollar narrative.

But I keep coming back to the capital asymmetry problem. Hardware companies need money to scale manufacturing, and $500K against Helsing's €1.4 billion is not a mismatch — it's a category error. The protocol-layer play here would be if the agentic control software became a standard that other drone manufacturers adopted, creating compounding network effects. Shield AI is already executing that exact strategy with Hivemind. Seeing Systems is building an integrated product — drones with smart software — not a primitive that an ecosystem builds on. That caps the structural upside in my framework. And without public revenue data, the downside cushion is just prototype relationships and Alexander's defense network — real assets, but not the "killer business financially today" floor I look for. The company occupies a structurally attractive market with credible founders, but the consensus nature of the opportunity and the capital dynamics make this a bet on execution against overwhelming resource disadvantage, not a bet on structural insight that the market has mispriced.
