# Agentic Fabriq -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first and most important thing to see, because it tells you everything. Oasis Security has raised $75 million. Astrix Security has raised $85 million. SGNL raised $42 million and was acquired by CrowdStrike for $740 million -- before Agentic Fabriq appears to have shipped anything. WorkOS has $199 million in funding and $30 million in ARR. Okta -- the literal company this startup is named in reference to -- launched Auth for GenAI and the Cross App Access protocol in the fall of 2025. Microsoft is building agent identity features into Entra ID. More than $200 million in dedicated startup capital, three dominant incumbents, and a $740 million acquisition have all converged on the same thesis: AI agents need identity and permission management. When every well-capitalized player in an industry sees the same opportunity simultaneously, there is no secret. There is only a race, and races are the province of losers.

The naming convention itself is diagnostic. "Okta for Agents" is not a secret -- it is a category label that anyone with a browser and thirty seconds of reflection could generate. Okta's own product team generated it independently and shipped Auth for GenAI to general availability in October 2025, a month before Agentic Fabriq's YC launch post. The slight reframing -- "employee-scoped agent permissions" rather than "non-human identity management" -- is a positioning choice on a whiteboard, not a contrarian truth about the world. No serious person in enterprise security disagrees that agent permissions should be scoped to the humans they serve. Microsoft's own security blog states that 90% of agents are over-permissioned. The problem is consensus. The insight is consensus. The solution architecture -- OAuth delegation, policy engines, audit logging, prebuilt connectors -- is built from components that any competent security engineering team could assemble, and several already have.

The founders are two MIT dropouts in their late teens with AI and ML research backgrounds from prestigious labs -- CSAIL, Kavli Institute, Haystack Observatory. I have a known affinity for technically brilliant young founders who leave school to build. Vitalik Buterin was nineteen when he received the Thiel Fellowship. Zuckerberg was nineteen when I wrote the check. But what distinguished those founders was not their youth or their credentials -- it was the specificity and contrarianism of their vision. Buterin had a detailed cryptographic architecture for programmable money that most computer scientists thought was either impossible or pointless. Zuckerberg understood something about real identity and network density that contradicted the prevailing anonymous-internet orthodoxy. I see no analogous contrarian conviction from the Agentic Fabriq founders. Their background is in ML research, not enterprise security or identity infrastructure -- they have not lived inside the problem they are solving. And the "Okta for Agents" framing is definitionally imitative: the company is defined in reference to an existing monopoly rather than articulating its own vision of how the world works differently than people expect.

The strongest bull case requires you to believe that the agent permission layer is architecturally distinct enough from human IAM that Okta's bolt-on approach structurally cannot work -- that the data model required to scope per-employee agent permissions is fundamentally incompatible with directory-based SSO, and that a purpose-built platform will win the way Okta itself won against Active Directory during the cloud transition. If you believe this, the timing is extraordinary: 40% of enterprise applications are projected to feature embedded agents by 2026, up from 5% in early 2025. A genuinely new identity layer created by a platform transition would be a massive opportunity. But the analogy breaks down on inspection. The client-server to cloud transition changed the entire authentication substrate -- from on-premise directories to federated identity in the browser. The agent permission layer does not change the substrate. The underlying protocols -- OAuth 2.0, SAML, SCIM -- remain the same. What changes is the delegation chain, and delegation is a feature, not an architecture. Okta's XAA protocol directly addresses it. This is why CrowdStrike paid $740 million for SGNL: the incumbents can buy their way into this market faster than a two-person pre-seed team can build it.

The Girardian dynamics are unmistakable. Multiple companies, all well-funded, all converging on the same insight, all competing for the same enterprise buyers, all building with the same technical components. The mimetic rivalry will compress margins, inflate customer acquisition costs, and ultimately benefit the incumbents who already own the buyer relationship. Okta does not need to build the best agent permission product -- it needs to build a sufficient one and bundle it with the identity platform that every enterprise already uses. This is the pattern that destroyed cleantech in the 2000s: consensus thesis, competitive market structure, commoditizable technology, and well-resourced incumbents who can absorb the innovation as a feature. I pass.
