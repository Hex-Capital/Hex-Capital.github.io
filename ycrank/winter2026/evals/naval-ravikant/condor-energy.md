# Condor Energy -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I check is the technical builder. Clément is listed as CTO, but his background is X-HEC business school and hydropower operations. No public GitHub. Neither of the other two founders has visible code either. Florian is a former power trader. Jean ran hydropower projects. This is a team of domain operators and financial quants -- but where is the technologist who built the core product? I've said it repeatedly: this is the technology business, and you want a technology team. When I can't find a single founder with a public engineering footprint, I start asking who actually wrote the software. Maybe Clément codes and just doesn't publish -- but the absence of signal where I expect signal is itself a signal.

On specific knowledge: Florian's background is the strongest card. Power trading is genuinely non-trivial -- understanding how wholesale electricity markets clear, how basis risk works across nodes, how hedging strategies interact with physical load profiles. That knowledge comes from years on a trading desk, not from a weekend course. The combination of Florian's financial market expertise with Jean and Clément's physical infrastructure experience on hydropower gives this team a two-sided view of energy markets that most SaaS founders in the space lack. But I have to be honest about the distinction between professional expertise and the kind of obsessive, self-directed specific knowledge that produces genuinely non-obvious insights. These founders learned their domain through standard career paths -- elite French schools, institutional trading desks, infrastructure projects. The 200+ customer interviews they cite as validation work is diligent, but it's market research, not revelation. I want to hear the founder tell me something about energy procurement that surprises me, that I couldn't have extracted from the same interviews myself. That signal isn't present in the dossier.

The leverage test is where this company most clearly falls short of my framework. Condor automates what energy consultants and procurement teams already do -- manually aggregating consumption data, modeling hedging strategies in spreadsheets, running NPV calculations on behind-the-meter assets. The output is the same: a better-informed procurement decision. The input is the same: large C&I customers with complex energy portfolios. Condor makes existing work faster and cheaper, but it doesn't create a new form of capability that didn't exist before. Compare this to what Replit does -- Replit doesn't make existing programmers marginally faster; it enables people who never would have coded to build software. That's new leverage. Condor enables a CFO to do what they already do with consultants, minus the consultants. Automation is valuable, but it's not leverage in the way I use the word. It's not multiplying output by orders of magnitude. It's compressing cost by a fraction -- "up to 20%" per their own claim.

The timing isn't contrarian either. Energy market complexity from renewable intermittency, data center demand explosion, post-2022 European energy crisis awareness -- these are consensus themes. Every infrastructure investor I talk to is looking at energy management. Voltus has raised $121M. Pexapark has $41M. Gridmatic has $40M. Smart people are not dismissing this market; they're already crowding into it. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal. When I backed Bitcoin, it was dismissed as nerd money. Here, the market is real, acknowledged, and already being served by well-capitalized competitors. "The incumbents are slow and bloated" is not a contrarian insight -- it's the standard pitch deck slide. The bull case would require Condor to be the first team to nail the integrated buyer-side platform in a market where the existing players address adjacent but not identical problems. That's possible -- Voltus is sell-side, Pexapark serves generators, Granular tracks certificates. The pure buyer-side procurement optimization platform might genuinely be an underserved niche. But being the first integrated solution in an adjacent niche is an execution bet, not a structural insight about how the world is about to change.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? If the energy transition genuinely creates a new financial instrument class -- where every large electricity consumer must actively trade their energy portfolio the way hedge funds trade equities -- then the team with a real power trader (Florian) building the Bloomberg Terminal for corporate energy procurement wins big. If data center operators become so large and so energy-intensive that they need dedicated trading infrastructure, and if Condor becomes the standard platform embedded in every data center operator's procurement workflow, the switching costs and data compounding could create a durable position. The structural argument -- that energy buying is transitioning from a simple fixed-price contract to a complex financial trading operation -- is plausible. If that transition is as deep as the founders believe, the team's specific knowledge in power trading becomes a real edge. But that thesis requires several things to be true simultaneously: the market transition must be as fundamental as they claim, they must win against better-funded competitors, and they must build the technical moat that isn't yet visible.

I see a competent team with relevant professional experience building a reasonable product in a real market. What I don't see is the signal I need to write a check from my own money: non-teachable knowledge that produces non-obvious insights, a leverage architecture that creates genuinely new capability, or contrarian timing that gives me asymmetric pricing. This is vertical SaaS for energy procurement -- well-executed, well-timed to a consensus trend, addressing a genuine pain point. That's a real business. But my portfolio construction requires asymmetric upside from non-consensus bets, and this is a consensus bet with linear upside. Pass.
