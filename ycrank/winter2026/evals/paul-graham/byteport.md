# Byteport -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Byteport is where the founder came from before he built it. Jayram Palamadai spent two years as a research associate on the CMS experiment at Fermilab -- one of the most data-intensive operations humans have ever constructed. The Large Hadron Collider generates data at a scale where the physics community has spent decades building custom infrastructure just to move files between institutions. If you've worked on CMS, you haven't read about the pain of large-file transfer. You've lived inside it. That's a real organic discovery signal. The problem didn't come from a brainstorming session or a TechCrunch trend report. It came from sitting in a lab watching petabytes crawl across networks.

But here's where my enthusiasm stalls: this is not a hidden problem. Schlep blindness is when smart people unconsciously filter out painful problems, leaving the solution space empty. That's not what's happening here. IBM acquired Aspera specifically to solve accelerated file transfer. Signiant built a $42.5 million revenue business on it. MASV, FileCatalyst, and Raysync all exist. The schlep has been seen -- and tackled -- by well-funded companies with years of production deployment. What Byteport is really arguing is not "nobody noticed this problem" but "the existing solutions are overbuilt and overpriced for the next wave of customers." That's a valid thesis -- it's essentially what Stripe argued about payment processing. But it's a different and harder argument than "I found something everyone else missed." You're not fighting schlep blindness. You're fighting incumbents.

The solo founder question is the one I can't get past. I've written about why cofounders matter, and I've lived it -- I made Drew Houston go find one before I'd accept Dropbox. Jayram is 18, has no prior startup experience, and is attempting to compete against IBM's enterprise sales machine by himself. The website claims the product was "built by the team that developed Netflix Workstations," but this is a team of one, and the specific Netflix role is unverifiable from public sources. That phrasing concerns me. At best it's imprecise marketing. At worst it's the kind of credential inflation that signals a founder optimizing for fundraising optics rather than building. I don't know which it is, and at pre-seed with my own money, the ambiguity itself is the problem.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement because the technical foundation could be real. An 18-year-old who published machine learning research on arXiv, worked at Fermilab for two years, and appears to have built a working product with end-to-end encryption, storage integrations, and a functioning pay-as-you-go pricing model -- that's not nothing. If the transfer protocol genuinely delivers the claimed performance, and if the zero-configuration promise holds, there's a "Stripe for file transfer" opportunity here. The AI training data market is exploding. Remote VFX workflows are permanent. Autonomous vehicle sensor data is growing exponentially. The timing tailwinds are real. If Jayram finds a technical cofounder who complements his protocol work with enterprise go-to-market experience, and if the speed claims survive independent benchmarking, this could become a serious company. But those are two significant "ifs," and right now neither has been resolved.

What I see is a technically capable young founder who found a real problem through genuine experience, but who is trying to solo it in a crowded market against entrenched competition, with unverified technical claims, zero visible traction, and pricing 3x above the nearest comparable product. The pieces that would make me invest -- a cofounder, one paying customer, one published benchmark -- are all absent. At this stage, that's not disqualifying in theory. But when I'm writing my own check, I need at least one concrete signal that the product works as claimed and that someone outside YC wants it. I don't have that signal yet.
