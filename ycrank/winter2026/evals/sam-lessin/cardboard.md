# Cardboard -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Cardboard is almost a laboratory specimen of the company I pass on fastest. An "agentic video editor" built on Claude Sonnet, selling subscriptions at $60 and $150 per month, competing in a category where Runway has raised $860 million and Descript has $55 million in ARR. When I wrote that "software companies that had moats are learning they aren't moats anymore," I was describing exactly this topology: a software tool whose core differentiator is an AI capability available to every competitor through the same API. The product page literally names the foundation model it depends on. That's not a moat -- that's a shared utility line.

The sane-person-insane-idea test collapses here because the idea isn't remotely insane. "AI will transform video editing" is possibly the most consensus take in all of technology right now. Every VC in San Francisco would nod vigorously at this pitch. When I funded Solana at five cents, or Teamshares when they said they'd buy hundreds of small businesses through employee ownership, investors thought those ideas were absurd. Nobody thinks AI video editing is absurd -- they think it's inevitable. And inevitable ideas with obvious execution paths get priced into the market instantly. You're buying at market, not at non-consensus discount. The founders are credible for the problem -- Ishan's 4.5 years building performance-critical web applications at HackerRank maps directly to the WebGPU/WebCodecs challenge, and their 15-year relationship is the kind of co-founder depth I take seriously. But credible founders on a consensus idea is my least favorite configuration. It means you're paying for competent execution in a race where the other runners have $860 million head starts.

Apply my "cherry on top" test: would this business be compelling if AI didn't exist? Without the agentic layer, Cardboard is a browser-based video editor -- which is what Kapwing already is, with $10.4 million in revenue and years of product iteration. The AI isn't the cherry on top. The AI is the whole sundae. Strip it away and there's no structural reason this business exists that hasn't already been addressed. That's the opposite of what I look for. Craftwork works because painting crews are the business and software optimizes dispatch. Here, the software IS the business, running on someone else's AI, charging a subscription. Three red flags in one sentence.

The bull case, and I want to engage with it honestly, rests on the innovator's dilemma argument: Adobe can't rebuild Premiere Pro for the browser without cannibalizing decades of desktop architecture, and the compound engineering challenge of browser NLE plus agentic AI creates a window where a small team can establish the category before incumbents react. There's something to this. Adobe's Firefly integrations are additive bolts onto the existing product, not a ground-up rethinking. If Cardboard's orchestration layer -- the reliability of translating "30-second hook with three variants" into broadcast-ready output -- compounds faster than competitors can replicate, the data flywheel becomes real. The 1K+ early users and 7 named customers (PostHog is a legitimate company) suggest the product works. If I squint, I can see a world where this team captures the "Figma of video" positioning before anyone else, making browser-native collaborative video editing the default for marketing teams, with the agentic layer as genuine workflow lock-in. But this requires winning a foot race against massively better-capitalized competitors all converging on the same insight at the same time, using the same underlying models. That's a distribution fight, and distribution fights favor incumbents.

There's no protocol or primitive being created here. Cardboard doesn't establish a new layer that other businesses build on -- it's an end-user application sitting on top of other people's infrastructure (multimodal LLMs, WebGPU, browser APIs). Other companies don't get better when Cardboard succeeds. Compare that to Venmo creating a peer-to-peer payment primitive, or Aleo building zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure. Those investments created compounding ecosystem effects. This investment creates a product that lives or dies on its own execution in a crowded market. The narrative can expand -- from marketing teams to all video production -- but it's a narrative shared by every competitor in the space. Shared narratives aren't infinity stories; they're commodity stories with commodity returns.

I respect the founders' technical capability and their 15-year relationship. Those are real signals. But the structural logic here contradicts nearly everything in my investment framework: AI-first value proposition dependent on third-party models, SaaS subscription pricing as the business model, consensus market with massive incumbent capital, application-layer positioning with no path to becoming infrastructure. I'd rather back a painting company with a scheduling algorithm than a video editor built on someone else's intelligence.
