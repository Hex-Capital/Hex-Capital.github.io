# Chasi -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what catches my eye first: both Akash and Sarman were on the founding team at Axion Ray, where they spent years selling AI into the belly of Fortune 500 manufacturers -- Cummins, Boeing, Harley Davidson, Denso. Axion Ray went from pre-seed to a $62 million Series B. These two didn't read about industrial sales cycles in a McKinsey report; they lived inside them. And Akash actually built tractors at TAFE before that. So when they tell me equipment dealers are drowning in missed calls and spreadsheets and sub-60% fleet utilization, I believe they saw it with their own eyes. That kind of proximity to a problem matters. But proximity and the kind of biographical thread I look for are different things. I'd want to sit with them and ask the real question: how did you get here? Not the Axion Ray career arc -- the personal story. What happened in your life that made equipment dealer revenue the thing that keeps you up at night? And from everything I can see in this dossier, that answer isn't present. The connection is professional, not personal. It's a strong professional connection, genuinely -- but my best investments have always come from founders who couldn't not solve their specific problem because it was woven into who they are.

The thing about AI agents for sales automation is that right now, in early 2026, it's one of the most popular categories in venture. Every vertical is getting its own AI concierge, AI SDR, AI revenue engine. That's fine -- many of these will be real businesses -- but it means the "weird factor" I chase simply isn't here. Equipment dealers are genuinely unglamorous and overlooked, which I appreciate. Nobody at a San Francisco dinner party is going to get excited about automating follow-ups for rental companies in the Midwest. That part actually works for me. But the delivery mechanism -- LLM-powered conversational agents plugged into existing tech stacks -- is the definition of consensus right now. I backed Crusoe Energy when "mining Bitcoin on gas flares" made people look at me sideways. I backed Contraline when male contraception made VCs physically uncomfortable. Chasi doesn't generate that reaction. It generates a nod of approval, which in my experience is actually the less promising signal.

Let me steelman this, though, because I think the bull case is real. If you told me these founders could build a data flywheel where every dealer interaction makes the AI smarter about equipment-specific pricing, demand patterns, and close-rate optimization -- and that they could sign up enough dealers before Moab adds an AI layer to its $16M-funded ERP platform -- then you'd have a company with genuine switching costs and compounding intelligence that no horizontal AI agent could replicate. The AED Summit exhibition and Ambassador partnership suggest they're doing the hard, unsexy work of earning industry credibility, not just running Facebook ads. And the fact that they're live in both the US and Europe at this stage, as a two-person team, is scrappy in a way I respect. The equipment distribution market genuinely exceeds a trillion dollars, and the software penetration on the sales and communication layer is essentially zero. First mover advantage in a sleepy vertical with real relationships can be durable.

But then I look at the competitive picture and the defensibility question gets harder. Moab just emerged from stealth with $16M, led by an ex-Uber PM and ex-Ramp Head of Engineering, and they're building the full operating system for equipment dealers. Adding AI sales features to a modern ERP is a much smaller leap than building an ERP from scratch. Texada has been entrenched since 1984. And the core technology -- LLM-powered conversational agents -- is increasingly commoditized. What protects Chasi isn't fundamental technology risk, it's integration knowledge and industry relationships. Those are real but fragile moats, especially against a competitor with eight times the funding entering the same vertical simultaneously. The integration dependency on legacy DMS systems with limited APIs is also a concern I've seen sink companies before -- when your value depends on plugging into someone else's system, they can turn off the spigot.

On the economic access dimension, I see a company that helps existing businesses operate more efficiently -- 2+ hours saved per rep, 15% better quote-to-win rates. That's valuable to those businesses. But it's not creating new economic opportunity for people who didn't have it before. When I look at my portfolio, the companies I'm proudest of -- Uber creating income for drivers, Postmates enabling delivery workers, Affirm giving transparent credit access to people banks ignored -- they opened doors that were previously closed. Chasi opens a wider door for businesses that are already operating. It's a different kind of impact, and not the kind that gives me that visceral pull.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the strongest signal here for my framework. These two built together through multiple stages at Axion Ray. They've survived the stress of an early-stage company scaling to a $62M raise. That's exactly the kind of battle-tested relationship I've learned to value after watching HQ Trivia implode from co-founder conflict. The fact that they chose to start a new company together after that shared experience tells me something about their working relationship. If I were going to write a check into Chasi, this is the dimension that would give me the most confidence.

Ultimately, these are skilled founders with genuine domain expertise applying currently-popular technology to an unsexy vertical. It's a reasonable bet, and I wouldn't be surprised if they build a solid business. But I'm not feeling the jolt. The most promising investments in my experience are the ones that are difficult to assess and unpopular -- Chasi is straightforward to assess and sits squarely in the most popular category in tech right now. The founders' professional backgrounds are impressive without being the kind of biographical intensity that makes me want to drop everything and help them win. This is a pass for me, but a respectful one.
