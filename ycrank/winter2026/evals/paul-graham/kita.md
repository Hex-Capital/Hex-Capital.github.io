# Kita -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Carmel Limcaoco is from Manila. That's the first thing I noticed, and it changes the entire evaluation. When a founder grew up in a country where half the population can't get a loan because their financial history lives in messy e-wallet screenshots and crumpled payslips, and she comes back to build document intelligence for that market — that's not a startup idea. That's an organic discovery. She didn't read a report about emerging market fintech opportunity. She grew up inside the problem. The schlep here is exactly the kind that makes smart engineers look away: you have to build document models country by country, format by format, fraud pattern by fraud pattern, across the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, each with different regulations and different document types. Nobody at a hackathon brainstorms "let's process noisy Philippine e-wallet records for lending underwriting." The problem is too ugly and too specific. That's precisely why it's a good one.

The Stripe parallel here is structural, not superficial. Every programmer in 2010 knew payment processing was broken. Nobody wanted to walk into the banks. Stripe's moat wasn't the API — it was the willingness to do the regulatory, compliance, and banking schlep that thousands of hackers unconsciously filtered out. Kita is the same pattern applied to document intelligence in emerging markets. Every ML engineer knows VLMs can extract data from documents. But extracting structured signals from a Philippine e-wallet statement, checking it for fraud patterns specific to Manila lending, and linking those signals to repayment outcomes — that's a schlep most AI teams would rather avoid in favor of building tools for clean US data. The localization work is the moat, and the moat is the schlep.

What impresses me about the founding team is the technical depth. Rhea Malhotra won the Firestone Medal — the best honors thesis in Stanford's CS department — for work in computer vision. She's published at ICRA, RSS, and Humanoids. Her research focus is exactly what this product requires: vision-language models, computer vision, learning systems. This isn't a team that will outsource their core technology to contractors or wrap a GPT-4V API and call it a product. They built a working prototype and immediately secured a six-figure paid pilot from a Philippine lender. That sequence — build the thing, get someone to pay for it — is the right order. Too many founders raise money, then try to build, then try to sell. These two built and sold before they had to raise anything significant.

The commoditization objection is the obvious one and it's worth addressing head-on. Yes, VLMs are getting better. Yes, in principle, anyone could point GPT-4V at a Philippine bank statement and extract some data. But there's a difference between extracting text from a document and knowing which signals in that document predict whether someone will repay a loan. That second part requires a feedback loop connecting document-level extraction to lending outcomes, and that feedback loop requires having lender customers, and getting lender customers requires the country-by-country localization work that nobody wants to do. Each step depends on the previous one. The defensibility isn't in the AI — it's in the data flywheel that only starts spinning once you've done the localization schlep.

The traction signals are thin but real. A six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage tells you something important: this lender wasn't doing Kita a favor. Lending institutions don't pay six figures for software they don't need. Expanding to multiple Southeast Asian markets and growing roughly 30% month-over-month as a two-person team is a signal of genuine pull, not manufactured growth. The risk is customer concentration — they may have two or three customers — but at pre-seed with two founders, the right question isn't "how many customers?" but "are the customers you have genuinely dependent on you?" A lender paying six figures for a prototype strongly suggests yes.

The main concern I'd flag is the enterprise sales cycle. Selling document processing infrastructure to lending institutions involves compliance reviews, security audits, and deep integrations with loan origination systems. Two people managing multi-market enterprise sales while simultaneously building the product is a real constraint. But this is the kind of problem that money solves — it's an execution challenge, not a structural flaw. The structural advantage (Carmel's Manila network and local context as the initial wedge) gives them distribution that a competitor would have to build from scratch.

If I'm being honest about what excites me here: it's the combination of an organic problem that hides behind schlep blindness, a technical co-founder whose research credentials are precisely calibrated to the core technology, and evidence that lenders are already willing to pay. The founders met before Stanford, have been building together through undergrad and grad school, and both have CS degrees — this isn't a team that was assembled to pursue a market opportunity. They're earnest. The idea grew from Carmel's lived experience. The technology is Rhea's actual domain of expertise. When the founder's background, the co-founder's technical specialty, and the product all point in the same direction, that's not a coincidence. That's organic.
