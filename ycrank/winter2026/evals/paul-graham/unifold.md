# Unifold -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Unifold is also its most dangerous complication. All three founders worked at MoonPay — one of them built a wallet-as-a-service company that MoonPay acquired. They saw from the inside how broken cross-chain deposit flows are, and they left to fix it. That's the exact origin story I look for. It's the Stripe pattern: insiders who understood the infrastructure's failures because they were building it. Timothy Chung didn't read a blog post about multi-chain fragmentation and decide to start a company. He built Streambird, sold it to MoonPay, watched the problem persist from inside a $3.4B company, and left to solve it properly. That's organic. But here's the complication: Glide, a YC S23 company with $15M in Series A funding and a CEO who built the Robinhood Wallet, is doing essentially the same thing with a two-and-a-half-year head start.

The schlep here is real but it isn't blind. Multi-chain deposit orchestration — dealing with different address formats, gas mechanics, bridging protocols, compliance regimes across Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and dozens of L2s — is genuinely tedious infrastructure work. Most application teams would rather not build it themselves. But this problem is already visible to the market. Glide saw it. Fireblocks sees it from the enterprise side. MoonPay itself could build this. When I look for schlep blindness, I'm looking for problems that smart people unconsciously filter out because the work is too ugly. Payments before Stripe were like that — everyone knew they were broken, but nobody wanted to deal with the banks. Multi-chain deposits in 2026 are a known problem with multiple funded teams attacking it. The schlep exists, but the blindness has lifted.

The co-founder relationship is the piece that makes me take this more seriously than a typical "same problem, less money" competitor. These three people didn't meet at a co-founder matching event. They converged at MoonPay — Timothy through his acquisition, Quang through 2.5 years of operational work, Hau through blockchain engineering at both Solana Labs and MoonPay. That's the kind of co-founder formation that survives stress. They've also collectively touched almost every piece of the infrastructure stack they're building: wallet provisioning, chain-level engineering, payments operations at scale. Timothy has an exit. Quang has 15+ years and a prior acquisition. These aren't first-timers guessing at a problem from the outside.

The bull case is straightforward and worth taking seriously. If the crypto infrastructure market continues its current trajectory — stablecoin volume hitting $33 trillion, chain fragmentation accelerating, YC itself accepting stablecoin funding — then every consumer-facing on-chain application needs deposit orchestration. The team that makes this work in under 10 lines of code, with compliance baked in and gas sponsored, captures the picks-and-shovels position I've always favored. Developer tools that abstract away painful infrastructure tend to become sticky once integrated. If Unifold can ship faster and with deeper exchange integrations than Glide — leveraging the compliance knowledge they gained inside MoonPay — the funding gap matters less than execution speed. The "Stripe of crypto deposits" is a real company if someone builds it right.

But what keeps me from writing a check is the absence of any evidence that users are pulling this product toward them. Private beta, zero revenue, $0 pricing, no public metrics. The Alpha Arcade integration is a named reference on a YC page, not a usage statistic. Named ecosystem partnerships with Algorand and MegaETH could mean anything from deep technical integration to a logo swap. At pre-seed I don't demand much traction — but I want some signal that the product works and someone cares. A single statistic about deposit volume processed, or one developer saying "I integrated this and it saved me three weeks," would change my calculus. Right now I'm evaluating the founders' credentials and the problem's reality, but I have no evidence that the specific product they built is the right solution. Stripe's first signal wasn't the TAM of online payments — it was developers voluntarily installing it because it was obviously better. I don't see that signal yet for Unifold.

The competitive positioning also gives me pause in a specific way. Glide's CEO built the Robinhood Wallet and raised $15M. That's not a weak competitor who will fade. In a market where the core technical components — address generation, transaction routing, gas abstraction — are implementable by well-resourced teams, being second with less capital is a difficult position. Unifold's differentiation claim centers on compliance integrations with centralized exchanges, which is genuinely valuable schlep if they can nail it. But it's an incremental advantage, not a structural one. I'd want to understand specifically what they learned at MoonPay that Glide's team doesn't know from Robinhood — what proprietary insight makes their routing or compliance approach fundamentally better, not just marginally different.
