# Tepali -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is who's already in this room. Boulevard raised $80M in July 2025 specifically to push into medspas with AI features. AestheticsPro is an established medspa-specific incumbent. Zenoti has $331M in funding and $174M in revenue. And then Tepali walks in: two founders, no medspa experience, pre-launch, competing for the same vertical. When I see a market where well-funded companies are publicly announcing they're converging on exactly your niche, that's not a hidden opportunity. That's a crowded one.

The question I always ask first is: how did they find this problem? I've looked through everything available on both founders, and I can't find any connection to the medspa industry. Chrisvin Jabamani comes from investment banking at PJT Partners and operations at Rilla. That's a respectable background. But the dossier explicitly notes that neither founder has clinical, operational, or ownership experience in medical aesthetics. When someone with a finance background builds "an AI-native operating system for medspas," the most likely origin story is market research — they saw a growing TAM with fragmented software and decided to attack it. That's the pattern I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas." Smart people who want to start a company, sit down to brainstorm, and pick a vertical that looks attractive on paper. The idea could have been conceived by anyone reading the Grand View Research report on medspa management software. That's very different from Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive or the Airbnb founders needing to make rent.

The schlep here is real but misunderstood. HIPAA compliance, injection maps, provider qualification matching — these are genuinely hard problems. But schlep blindness only creates opportunity when the schlep keeps competitors away. In this case, AestheticsPro already handles HIPAA-compliant charting for medspas. Boulevard is spending $80M to add exactly these capabilities. The painful work isn't deterring anyone — it's just making the work harder. Compare this to Stripe in 2010: thousands of programmers knew payments were broken, but nobody wanted to walk into the banks. The banking schlep created a vacuum that persisted for over a decade. Here, the vacuum is already filling rapidly from multiple directions. A two-person team entering this fight without domain expertise is bringing a slingshot to a tank battle.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: medspa is a weird hybrid category — part medical, part beauty, part retail — and none of the existing players were born to serve it. Zenoti is enterprise. Boulevard is premium self-care broadly. Vagaro is horizontal. AestheticsPro exists but hasn't broken out. If Tepali could become the Toast of medspas — the purpose-built vertical platform that wins by understanding the workflow better than anyone — the market is growing fast enough (15.77% CAGR for the broader industry) to support a large outcome. Chrisvin's GitHub shows real technical ability across mobile and AI tooling, which matters. And getting into YC W26 means they passed a filter that rejects most applicants. For this bull case to work, though, the founders would need to rapidly develop the domain expertise they currently lack, ship a product that's meaningfully better than AestheticsPro, and outrun Boulevard's $80M expansion — all while maintaining HIPAA compliance as a two-person team. That's at least two miracles.

The co-founder situation concerns me independently. Vishnu Pathmanaban has essentially no public footprint — no LinkedIn details, no GitHub, no Twitter. For a two-person team, I need to understand both people. When I can only evaluate one of two founders, I'm investing half-blind. And the naming confusion between Lotus (the email domain, the GitHub repos) and Tepali suggests this company is still finding its identity, which at pre-seed is normal but combined with everything else reinforces the impression of an idea still being assembled rather than one that's been burning inside the founders for years.

Chrisvin strikes me as genuinely capable — programming ability across Kotlin and AI tooling, finance sophistication from PJT Partners, startup operations experience from Rilla. These are real skills. But capability isn't the same as fit. The most dangerous failure mode in startups isn't incompetent founders — it's competent founders working on the wrong problem. When I ask whether these specific founders have an unfair advantage in medspa software specifically, the honest answer is no. Their advantages are general-purpose. And in a market where Boulevard can hire fifty engineers who specialize in medspa workflows, general-purpose advantages erode quickly.
