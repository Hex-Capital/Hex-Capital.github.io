# FullSeam -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice about FullSeam is the absence of a technologist on the founding team. Thomas Dowling studied political science and history, did a Rhodes at Oxford, and advised the Chicago mayor's office. Aaron Coppa has a Stanford MBA and ran product. Geoff Segal has the most quantitative background -- actuarial statistics at State Farm -- but none of the three have public GitHub repos, and none appear to be the kind of builder who has been writing code obsessively for years. I've said this repeatedly: this is the technology business. You want a technologist on the founding team. An AI agent company where the core technical capability appears to be built by unnamed engineers is a structural concern, not a timing issue. Who is the person who understands, at the architectural level, how to make these agents reliable enough that a CFO will trust them to enter GL entries autonomously? That question doesn't have a visible answer in this dossier.

The specific knowledge question is where FullSeam lands in the middle rather than at either extreme. The three founders built TaxProper together -- YC S19, grew to process $1B+ annually in property tax payments across 115,000 properties, sold to Opendoor in 2022. That's a real exit and real operational experience building financial software at scale. But TaxProper was property tax reduction and management, not accounts receivable and payable automation. The connection is "we built finops software and experienced AP/AR pain at our own company." Every founder who has ever run a company has experienced AP/AR pain. The insight that "accounting teams don't need another dashboard, they need teammates" is accurate but not non-obvious -- it's the consensus framing of every AI agent startup in 2026. I compare this unfavorably to what I saw with Stack Overflow, where the founders had spent years inside developer communities and understood something deep about how programmers share knowledge that no one else had articulated. Here, the founders understand the problem because they lived through it operationally, which is good, but it's not the kind of knowledge that takes a competitor years to accumulate.

The timing is my biggest concern. "AI agents for finance and accounting" is not contrarian in February 2026 -- it is the consensus bet. Bill.com has already shipped AI Agents for touchless B2B transactions. Tipalti raised $200M specifically for AI investment. Every major incumbent is adding agent capabilities. Multiple YC companies are in adjacent spaces. The framing "AI employee" is becoming commodity language. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal. When I invested in Bitcoin in 2014, serious people called it a Ponzi scheme. The asymmetric upside in those bets came from being right when the crowd was wrong. Here, the crowd agrees that AI will automate accounting workflows -- the only question is who captures the value. That's an execution race, not a contrarian bet. Execution races favor incumbents with distribution.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If I steel-man FullSeam: these are repeat founders with a shared exit who clearly work well together -- that co-founder durability through growth, acquisition, and post-acquisition is a genuine integrity signal. The cross-platform agent layer is structurally interesting because Bill.com and Tipalti can't easily build something that operates across their competitors' platforms without cannibalizing their own lock-in. If FullSeam's agents become the connective tissue between a company's QuickBooks, Stripe, Salesforce, and banking tools, the switching costs compound with every configured workflow and GL mapping. There's a version of this that becomes infrastructure -- the operating layer between all financial tools -- rather than just another automation product. That infrastructure play would fit my portfolio thesis. But I'd need to see evidence that the technical architecture is being built with that compounding vision, and I'd need a technical co-founder I could point to who is the driving force behind it.

The leverage architecture is standard SaaS automation -- code replacing human labor in repetitive workflows. That's baseline leverage; every software company has it. What FullSeam doesn't create is a new category of leverage that didn't previously exist. Compare this to what AngelList did for fundraising or what CoinList did for token distribution -- those platforms enabled entirely new types of transactions that weren't possible before. FullSeam makes existing transactions faster and cheaper. That's a valuable business, potentially, but it's not the leverage-creation signal that gets me most excited. It's automation, not transformation.

Three competent founders with a prior exit, building in a large market, with clear product direction. But no visible technical depth on the founding team, deeply consensus timing, operational rather than obsessive domain knowledge, and application-layer positioning in a category where incumbents are already moving. The compound interest on this bet is limited by the replicability of the underlying technology and the absence of a clear moat beyond integration complexity. I'd want to see a different founding team composition to put my own money here.
