# Didit -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The pivot tells the story. Alberto and Alejandro Rosas launched Gamium in 2021 -- a blockchain metaverse project with a token (GMM) and partnerships with Meta and Telefónica. Two years later, they're building a B2B SaaS KYC verification tool. The direction of this pivot is the opposite of what I want to see. They moved from an ambitious protocol-layer identity play -- speculative but potentially novel -- to a commoditized compliance product where the primary differentiation is price. That trajectory suggests they discovered what customers will pay for, which is pragmatic, but it also suggests they're following demand rather than following specific knowledge. The best founders I've backed didn't pivot toward consensus markets. They stayed stubborn on something everyone else dismissed until the world caught up.

What specific knowledge do the Rosas brothers possess that can't be taught? They have mathematics degrees and ML engineering capability -- Alberto's StyleGAN2 implementation on GitHub demonstrates real technical chops. But OCR, face matching, and liveness detection are not unsolved problems. They're engineering challenges where the solutions are increasingly available as cloud APIs and open-source models. The dossier itself flags "commoditization of core technology" as a key risk. Compare this to what specific knowledge in identity verification would actually look like: someone who spent a decade inside a bank's compliance operations understanding the thousand ways KYC workflows break, or someone who built the biometric pipeline at Onfido and saw the architectural limits firsthand. The Rosas brothers are smart mathematicians who discovered a market opportunity. That's different from founders whose non-transferable understanding of a domain gives them an unfair advantage.

The leverage question is where I push hardest. Didit is not creating a new form of leverage -- it's offering a cheaper version of an existing one. Persona, Sumsub, Veriff, and Onfido already turned identity verification into an API. Didit's innovation is pricing: 500 free verifications per month, $0.15 per ID check versus Sumsub's $1.35. That's a distribution strategy, not a leverage architecture. The one genuinely interesting idea buried in the product is reusable KYC -- verify once, use your credentials across platforms. That's a protocol-level concept with real network effects potential: each additional business accepting Didit credentials increases the value for every verified user. But it's not the core go-to-market. They're selling cheap KYC checks, not building an identity network. If they were building the identity network first and monetizing verification second, I'd be more interested. The order of operations reveals the thesis.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. 700+ active B2B customers growing 20% month-over-month, 300%+ net revenue retention at month 6, approximately 90% paid retention, and approaching profitability on only $2M raised -- these are strong signals by any standard. The capital efficiency is impressive. The NRR number, even accounting for the fact that it's inflated by customers graduating from a free tier to paid, suggests genuine product stickiness. If the free tier creates a Stripe-like distribution flywheel where developers adopt Didit for a side project and then bring it into their next funded company, the compounding could be real. The deepfake catalyst is also genuine -- AI-generated synthetic identities make robust verification an urgent necessity rather than a compliance checkbox. If Didit becomes the default KYC layer for the long tail of startups that Persona and Sumsub's sales teams can't economically reach, that's a meaningful business. The Orange/GSMA partnership shows an ability to secure distribution channels beyond self-serve.

But I keep returning to the structural question: what prevents Sumsub from launching a free tier tomorrow? Business model cannibalization is the typical answer -- incumbents won't undercut their existing revenue. That's the Christensen argument, and it works for a while. But Sumsub does $85.6M in revenue. Persona has $418M in funding and a $2B valuation. When Didit starts taking real enterprise share, these companies can respond with resources that dwarf a $2M raise. The technology doesn't compound in a way that creates durable distance. Every additional document type Didit supports, every ISO certification it earns -- these are incremental assets, not exponential moats. This is a race where the faster runner has shorter legs.

The timing isn't contrarian either. "Legacy KYC is expensive and slow" is the pitch slide every identity startup has used for the past five years. Twenty-plus funded competitors are saying the same thing. When the market universally agrees that incumbents are vulnerable, the asymmetric upside has been priced away. I want to be right when everyone else thinks I'm wrong. Here, everyone agrees with the thesis -- they just disagree about which challenger wins.
