# Kyten Technologies -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Kyten is that it's the opposite of what most founders in a 2026 batch would build. Everyone is chasing AI. These two guys left SpaceX to start a battery pack factory. That alone doesn't make it good, but it passes a filter most companies don't: this idea was not generated by checking what investors are excited about. It was generated by six years of putting battery packs into orbit and watching the rest of the industry struggle to keep up.

The organic test here is unusually clean. Cooper McBride and Lucas Maddox didn't read about the aerospace battery supply chain problem in a market report. They were the supply chain — managing hardware test and manufacturing at Starlink, deploying 5,000+ packs to low earth orbit. When they say legacy suppliers take 6-12 months per phase and they can do it in a week, that claim is rooted in having built the automated test and manufacturing systems at SpaceX that made Starlink's production cadence possible. This is the pattern I care about most: founders who stumbled into the problem through their own work, not founders who went looking for a market. The schlep here is also real and multi-layered — qualification standards like MIL-STD-810 and DO-160, ITAR compliance, thermal management, BMS integration, defense procurement relationships. This is ugly, tedious, regulatory work that most engineers would rather avoid by staying employed at a company that already handles it. The fact that two people chose to leave SpaceX to take on this schlep independently tells you something about their conviction.

The regulatory timing deserves separate attention because it's the kind of thing only insiders would see coming. NDAA Section 842 prohibiting DoD procurement of batteries from foreign entities of concern starting 2028, and the FCC immediately blocking new authorizations for foreign UAS components in December 2025 — these aren't abstract policy trends. If you're sitting inside SpaceX or Shield AI watching the defense supply chain, you see these regulations forming before they become law. Kyten wasn't founded in response to a news article. It was founded by people who watched this wave build from the inside and positioned themselves at the point of impact. That said, regulatory tailwinds are necessary but not sufficient. A forcing function that drives customers to re-source domestically benefits every US-based battery pack manufacturer, not just Kyten.

My concern is the gap between what these founders know how to do and what they've demonstrated as Kyten. The 5,000+ packs deployed are SpaceX metrics. There are no independent company customers, no revenue, no LOIs. At pre-seed this isn't unusual, but for a hardware manufacturing company the distance between "two people with expertise" and "a factory serving aerospace OEMs" is measured in millions of dollars of capital equipment. This isn't a software company where you can iterate in a garage. You need facilities, welding equipment, test stands, cell inventory, and qualification infrastructure. The YC $500K buys runway to land initial contracts, but the fundraising path after that is steep and hardware-specific. The strongest bull case is that even one defense contract — which the regulatory environment makes plausible — generates enough revenue to fund further buildout, and the SpaceX-derived manufacturing process knowledge gives them a genuine speed advantage over incumbents like EaglePicher whose organizational structure optimizes for a different cadence. If the "one week per phase" claim holds up even partially against the industry's 6-12 month norm, that's the kind of concrete value proposition that sells itself to procurement teams under regulatory deadline pressure.

The technical founder dimension is strong in a non-standard way. These aren't software hackers — there are no GitHub repos to inspect. But for a battery pack manufacturing company, the relevant expertise is power electronics, automated test systems, and manufacturing process design, and both founders have exactly that. McBride's EE degree in power electronics, his capstone designing a DC bidirectional battery charger for aerospace, and his track record building Shield AI's Hardware Test Team from scratch to 20+ people in under a year — that's the hardware equivalent of a programmer who stays up all night shipping code. The fact that both founders hold EE degrees with power-specific specializations and have complementary SpaceX tenures means the core product can be built by the people in the room. That matters more at pre-seed than almost anything else.

Where I land: Kyten passes the organic test and the schlep test decisively. The founders discovered this problem through years of lived experience, and the problem involves exactly the kind of tedious manufacturing complexity that causes schlep blindness. The regulatory timing adds conviction. What's missing is any evidence of customer pull — the demand is structural and logical but not yet demonstrated. And the capital intensity of hardware manufacturing means the path from here to a working business requires more miracles of execution (and fundraising) than a software company would. This is a company I'd watch closely. The foundation is right. The question is whether two people with $500K can cross the valley between SpaceX expertise and an independent aerospace manufacturing operation before the runway runs out.
