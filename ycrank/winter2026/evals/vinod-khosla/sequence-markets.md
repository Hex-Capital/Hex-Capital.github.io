# Sequence Markets -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company that has looked at a market with incumbents valued at $1.5 billion and $8 billion, competitors with granted patents, and hundreds of millions of dollars in deployed engineering capital -- and decided the right response is to build a slightly more focused version of what already exists. A non-custodial execution layer for digital asset trading. The technology works. The market is real. The team has relevant experience. And I stop right there, because the question that matters most is: if Sequence Markets succeeds completely, does the world operate differently? The answer is no. Institutions get marginally better fill prices on their crypto trades. That is the consequence of success. It is a decent business outcome, not a transformation worth betting on.

The competitive landscape tells the story clearly. Talos just raised at a $1.5 billion valuation with Robinhood as a strategic investor. FalconX sits at $8 billion. CoinRoutes holds a patent on the core technology -- smart order routing in crypto markets. Sequence Markets' response to this is to position itself as "venue-neutral" and "non-custodial," which is another way of saying smaller in scope. They have deliberately narrowed their ambition to a slice of what these incumbents already provide. This is the pattern I recognize instantly: reducing the probability of failure by shrinking the target until the consequence of success becomes inconsequential. Five people with a YC check cannot out-engineer firms with hundreds of engineers and hundreds of millions in capital on a problem those firms are already solving. The only way to win that fight is to redefine the problem entirely -- and I see no evidence of redefinition here.

The founders fit a pattern that concerns me. Peter Bai worked at TMX Group and a $12.8 billion pension fund. He knows market microstructure. He knows execution quality. He knows what the industry considers possible. That is precisely the profile I associate with incremental innovation -- someone who has internalized the rules of the existing system rather than questioning whether the system should exist. My highest-conviction investments have come from people who did not know what the established players considered impossible: a biochemistry professor reinventing meat, a New Zealander building rockets, a Xerox PARC scientist challenging Cisco. The founders here are building what their former employers would build if they prioritized this product category. That is optimization, not invention.

The strongest bull case requires you to believe that tokenization of real-world assets -- BCG projects $16 trillion by 2030 -- will create a genuinely new execution infrastructure market, and that the non-custodial, venue-neutral positioning becomes the default integration layer for every broker and custodian entering tokenized assets. If MiCA-style best-execution mandates spread globally, the regulatory demand for independent execution reporting could be structural. In that scenario, Sequence Markets is the Stripe of tokenized asset execution -- the neutral middleware everyone plugs into. I take this seriously as a possibility. But two things undermine it: first, Stripe succeeded because it was 10x easier than everything before it, creating a capability gap so large that developers shifted en masse. I see no evidence of a 10x improvement here -- the claims are "AI-powered routing" and "sub-millisecond latency," which are table stakes for any serious execution platform. Second, the incumbents are already moving into tokenized assets -- Talos acquired Coin Metrics, FalconX acquired 21Shares. The window for a standalone execution layer to establish itself before the full-stack platforms absorb this functionality is narrow and closing.

The timing trajectory deserves some credit. Institutional crypto adoption is accelerating, regulation is creating structural demand for best-execution technology, and the tokenization trend has real momentum. These are genuine tailwinds. But the founders did not arrive before the consensus formed -- they arrived after Talos hit $1.5 billion, after FalconX hit $8 billion, after CoinRoutes patented the core concept. This is not skating to where the puck will be. The puck is already there, and larger, faster players are already standing on it.
