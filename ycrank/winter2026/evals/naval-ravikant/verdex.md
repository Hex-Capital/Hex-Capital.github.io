# Verdex -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I look at is the claim on the YC page: "helping to insure over 11% of all American farmland." That's roughly 59 million acres. If accurate, it would be one of the most remarkable pre-seed traction signals I've encountered -- two recent Dartmouth graduates, no disclosed funding beyond YC, no named insurer partnerships, no press, no independent corroboration of any kind. The gap between the magnitude of that claim and the evidentiary vacuum surrounding it is the most important signal in this dossier. Either these founders have quietly secured a relationship with one or two major AIPs and are understating their position, or the claim is doing work that the product hasn't done yet. I can't invest on a number I can't verify, and the ambiguity itself -- "helping to insure" could mean anything from running a paid deployment to providing a free data feed -- is the kind of imprecision that makes me cautious about a founding team's communication discipline.

The specific knowledge question is where this falls short for me. Jad has Math and CS from Dartmouth's Guarini program. Evan won an engineering prize for an ML project diagnosing autism -- a completely different domain -- and spent time at Meta in client solutions. These are intelligent, technically capable people. But intelligence and technical capability are teachable. What's not teachable is the kind of knowledge that comes from years inside the crop insurance system -- understanding how USDA RMA regulations constrain claims verification, knowing which AIPs are politically positioned to adopt satellite-based adjudication, having relationships with the actuaries who set loss ratios. Federal crop insurance is one of the most regulation-dense markets in American agriculture. Sixteen buyers, all operating under USDA program rules that specify how claims are verified. A founder who has worked inside that system for a decade would know which regulatory gates can be opened and which are welded shut. These founders, as far as the public record shows, arrived at this problem from the outside. Any smart CS team with access to Planet imagery and a weather API could identify the same opportunity in a semester.

The leverage architecture is the strongest dimension here, and I want to be honest about that. Replacing physical field inspections with satellite-based remote assessment is genuine code leverage over labor -- one analytical system substituting for thousands of adjusters driving to farms after hailstorms. That's the right direction. But there's a distinction between automating an existing process and creating a new form of leverage that didn't exist before. Uber didn't make taxi dispatch more efficient; it turned every car into a potential taxi and every phone into a dispatch system. Verdex is making claims adjustment faster and cheaper -- valuable, but incremental. The product serves 16 enterprise buyers through direct sales, not millions of individuals through a self-serve platform. That's a consulting-shaped distribution model wearing a SaaS label.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. If the 11% traction claim is real and the founders have genuinely built a working satellite-to-claims pipeline that an AIP is using in production, then the data moat thesis activates. Every growing season adds another layer of time-series observations paired with actual claim outcomes. After five years, that historical dataset becomes the training ground for predictive models that no new entrant can replicate without half a decade of collection. The concentrated buyer base -- only 16 AIPs -- actually makes this a tractable sales problem rather than an impossible one. Win three or four of them and you own the category. And the regulatory environment may be shifting: USDA has been gradually accepting technology-assisted verification, and the political pressure to reduce program costs creates a tailwind for automation. If these founders have the intellectual honesty to hire domain experts who understand the regulatory landscape, and if they've genuinely locked in an early AIP relationship, this could compound into infrastructure that becomes difficult to displace. That's the Alchemy analogy -- a picks-and-shovels layer that every participant in the ecosystem eventually depends on.

But I keep returning to the same structural concern. The satellite imagery inputs are commoditized -- Planet, Sentinel-2, Airbus all provide high-resolution data at declining costs. The weather model data is publicly available. The ML techniques for crop damage assessment are well-documented in academic literature. Ceres AI has $86 million in funding and deep relationships with growers and agronomists; pivoting to insurance-specific workflows is a product decision, not a fundamental research challenge. EOSDA has already deployed claims assessment tools in Mexico. The technical moat here is thin -- it's an analytics layer built on commoditized inputs, competing in a space where better-funded companies have adjacent capabilities. And the contrarian timing test fails: "use satellite data to modernize agriculture" is not a thesis that smart people dismiss. It's a thesis that has attracted hundreds of millions in venture capital across multiple companies. The insurance-specific wedge is a reasonable positioning choice, but it's strategy, not insight.

Two smart recent graduates building satellite analytics for crop insurance. The leverage mechanics are sound. The market is real. But I don't see the non-teachable knowledge, the contrarian positioning, or the technical compounding that would make this a bet I'd want to hold for a decade. This is closer to "Salesforce but for crop adjusters" than to the infrastructure plays that define my portfolio. I'd want to see verified insurer deployment, a domain expert on the founding team, and evidence that the founders understand something about this market that surprises people who have spent careers inside it.
