## The Idea

**Problem:** Businesses, trade associations, and policy-impacted organizations need to monitor legislative activity across all 50 U.S. state legislatures and Congress to identify regulatory threats and opportunities. Today this work is handled by policy consultants charging approximately $500/hr (fed10.ai), with traditional legislative tracking services costing $10,000–$50,000+ annually (fed10.ai FAQ page). The process is slow—taking days—and expensive, making it inaccessible to many organizations that are nonetheless affected by legislation.

**Approach:** Fed10 deploys AI agents to continuously scan and analyze every bill introduced across all 50 states and the U.S. Congress. The platform flags threats to a user's specific business, delivers policy impact assessments, and generates actionable recommendations. The company describes this as completing in seconds what would take a human consultant days (fed10.ai). Core features include real-time legislative tracking, AI-powered bill analysis and summarization, custom alerts and notifications, and regulatory risk assessment (fed10.ai).

**Differentiation:** Incumbent platforms like FiscalNote and Quorum provide legislative tracking databases and workflow tools, but are priced for enterprise buyers and rely heavily on human analysis layered on top. Fed10 positions itself as an AI-native replacement for the human consultant layer—not just a tracking tool but a full "legislative consulting firm staffed by AI agents" (YC page). Compared to Plural Policy's collaboration-focused platform or GovHawk's alert-based tracking, Fed10 emphasizes end-to-end analysis and strategic recommendations rather than raw data delivery. The founding team's direct lobbying experience differentiates from purely technical competitors like USLege.

**Business Model:** No public pricing is disclosed. The website notes that traditional services cost $10,000–$50,000+ annually and positions Fed10 at "a fraction of traditional consulting costs" (fed10.ai). Pricing is available upon request via demo booking (fed10.ai/demo). [Inferred]: Most likely monetization path is a SaaS subscription model tiered by number of policy areas, jurisdictions tracked, or seats, given the B2B SaaS positioning and GovTech category norms.

**TAM/SAM:** The global public affairs and advocacy software market was estimated at $1.42 billion in 2024, projected to reach $3.09 billion by 2033 at a 9.1% CAGR (Growth Market Reports, 2024 via search snippet). North America accounts for approximately $620 million of the global market (Growth Market Reports, 2024 via search snippet). A separate estimate valued the market at $2.8 billion in 2024, projecting $5.6 billion by 2033 (OpenPR, 2024 via search snippet). The SAM for AI-native legislative consulting specifically is a subset of these figures. No public SAM data specific to Fed10's segment was found.

**GTM / Distribution:** The website offers a demo request flow at fed10.ai/demo (fed10.ai). [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct sales to government affairs teams at corporations, trade associations, and law firms, leveraging the founders' existing lobbying networks and relationships. The YC brand and Jared Friedman's partnership may accelerate enterprise introductions.

## Defensibility

**Data advantage (potential):** As Fed10 processes legislative data across all 50 states and Congress, proprietary analysis models trained on user interactions and policy outcomes could develop a data moat over time. However, the underlying legislative data is public, so the defensibility would reside in the analysis layer and proprietary training data, not in data access itself.

**Founder domain expertise:** The three co-founders have direct legislative experience, including passing bills and serving as gubernatorial appointees (YC page). This domain knowledge is embedded in the product's analytical framework and is harder to replicate than the technology alone.

No defensibility signals such as patents, network effects, or regulatory barriers were found in public sources. [Inferred]: Potential moat could develop via accumulated proprietary policy analysis data and customer-specific models, but is unproven at this stage.

**Market structure:** Incumbents like FiscalNote (public, $103M TTM revenue) and Quorum ($61M revenue) have built large sales organizations and deep enterprise relationships around human-augmented workflow tools. [Inferred]: An AI-native replacement model could represent business model cannibalization risk for these incumbents—replacing their professional services revenue with lower-cost automation would undercut their existing economics. FiscalNote's stock decline of ~97% from its merger price (Wikipedia via search snippet) and CEO transition suggest organizational distraction that may slow competitive response.

**Commoditization risk:** The underlying technology stack (LLM-based document analysis, legislative data APIs) is accessible to any well-resourced team. FiscalNote launched PolicyNote, an AI-focused platform, in January 2025 (FiscalNote press release via search snippet). Quorum and Plural Policy also incorporate AI features. Multiple startups (USLege, Plural Policy) are pursuing similar AI-legislative-tracking approaches. The barrier to building a basic version is low; the barrier to matching domain-specific accuracy for policy professionals may be higher.

## Market & Traction

**Traction signals:** No public data found for revenue, user counts, growth metrics, or customer testimonials. No Product Hunt listing was found. No app store presence or Chrome extension was identified. The company's LinkedIn page exists at linkedin.com/company/fed10 (LinkedIn search result). The company has an Instagram presence at @fed10.10 (Instagram search result). No Discord or Slack community was found. No job postings were identified, and the company is not currently hiring (YC page).

**Competitive landscape:**

| Competitor | Key Details | Differentiator vs. Fed10 |
|------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **FiscalNote** (NYSE: NOTE) | $120.27M revenue in 2024 (stockanalysis.com via search snippet); public company; covers 12,000+ local governments and 4,000 school boards | Broadest data coverage and enterprise scale, but declining revenue and organizational transition; legacy platform vs. Fed10's AI-native approach |
| **Quorum** | $61.1M revenue in 2024 with 438-person team (getlatka.com via search snippet); funding from Serent Capital (amount undisclosed); 1,800+ customers including 50%+ of Fortune 100 | Full-suite public affairs platform (grassroots advocacy, stakeholder engagement, legislative tracking); broader product scope vs. Fed10's AI-consulting focus |
| **Plural Policy** | $14M+ total funding including $10M Series A led by S3 Ventures (Plural Policy blog) | AI-powered collaboration platform for policy teams; emphasis on stakeholder intelligence and team workflows vs. Fed10's consultant-replacement positioning |
| **GovHawk** | Self-funded; operating since 2015 | Established tracking and alerts tool with comprehensive state/federal coverage; traditional SaaS approach vs. Fed10's AI agent model |
| **USLege** | Early-stage; backed by Avalanche.VC (Avalanche.VC portfolio page via search snippet) | AI-powered state policy tracking; closest in AI-native positioning to Fed10, though focused specifically on state-level automation |

**Why now:** [Inferred]: The convergence of two factors creates the opening: (1) LLM capabilities crossed a quality threshold in 2023–2025 that makes automated legislative analysis accurate enough for professional use—prior NLP approaches could not reliably parse and contextualize legal language at the level policy professionals require; (2) the volume of legislation is accelerating (1,208 AI-related bills alone were introduced across all 50 states in 2025 per FPF/NCSL data via search snippet), overwhelming traditional human-analyst models. FiscalNote's financial distress (stock down ~97%, revenue declining) may also signal market readiness for a lower-cost, AI-native alternative.

**Co-founder relationship:** All three founders "passed legislation together" before co-founding Fed10 (YC page, fed10.ai). Armand and Winston both have Las Vegas, NV connections (Las Vegas Sun, search results). Their shared legislative work predates the company, indicating a pre-existing working relationship in policy and lobbying.

**Founder-market fit:** The founding team combines direct legislative experience (all three co-founders were active lobbyists who passed real legislation) with technical capability (Zayan studied CS at Berkeley, Winston studied CS at Williams). Armand's experience as a gubernatorial appointee and his Harvard government studies provide deep policy domain knowledge. This combination of practitioners-turned-builders is directly relevant to building AI tools that can replicate expert policy analysis. No advisors, board members, or notable investors beyond YC were identified.

## Key Risks

**Well-funded incumbent AI adoption:** FiscalNote launched PolicyNote, an AI-focused product, in January 2025 (FiscalNote press release via search snippet). Quorum ($61M revenue) and Plural Policy ($14M+ funding) are also integrating AI capabilities. These incumbents have existing enterprise relationships and distribution that could allow them to add AI features faster than Fed10 can build enterprise sales infrastructure.

**Legislative data accuracy and liability:** Policy decisions carry high stakes for businesses. If Fed10's AI agents produce inaccurate bill analyses or miss relevant legislation, the consequences for customers could be severe. The company's positioning as a replacement for human consultants raises the accuracy bar compared to tools that merely surface data for humans to interpret. No information about accuracy benchmarks, error rates, or liability frameworks was found.

**Narrow initial wedge in a broad market:** Fed10 is entering a market that spans legislative tracking, regulatory monitoring, grassroots advocacy, and stakeholder management. Quorum's product suite and FiscalNote's breadth illustrate how customers often want an integrated platform. Fed10's consultant-replacement positioning may limit its initial addressable buyer set to organizations currently paying for external policy consultants, which is a subset of the broader market.

**Brand disambiguation:** "Fed10" shares its name with Federalist No. 10 (a foundational U.S. political document), Soviet-era camera models (FED-10), and various unrelated uses of "Fed" in financial contexts. This may create SEO challenges and brand confusion, particularly in political and policy search contexts where Federalist Paper references are common.
