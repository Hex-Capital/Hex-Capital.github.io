# RamAIn -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that hits me about RamAIn is how crowded the room already is. Simular has $26.5 million and DeepMind alumni. Browser Use has $17 million and Paul Graham's personal backing. OpenCUA is open-source and matching proprietary model performance. Anthropic and OpenAI are both shipping computer-use capabilities as API features. When I look at a space and see this much capital, this many credentialed teams, and this much platform-layer activity all converging in the same 18-month window, that's the opposite of the signal I've built my career on. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. Computer-use agents in early 2026 are neither -- they're the definition of consensus. This is the exact market dynamic I've trained myself to walk away from, because by the time everyone agrees something is real, the weirdness has been priced out and the upside belongs to whoever got there first.

When I ask myself about the founders' stories -- how they got here, what personal thread connects them to this specific problem -- I come up empty in a way that concerns me. Shourya Vir Jain and Vansh Ramani are clearly talented young people. Vansh's research credentials are legitimately impressive for someone his age -- an ICLR 2025 publication, work merged into Meta's FAISS library, a summer at CMU's ML department. Shourya bootstrapped Genoshi to revenue and worked with 80+ startups through IIT Delhi's entrepreneurship cell. These are capable, driven people. But where is the biographical urgency? Where is the lived experience that makes enterprise workflow automation the problem they were born to solve? I don't hear a story about watching a parent spend years doing soul-crushing data entry across legacy systems, or about spending time inside a healthcare operations team and seeing the human cost of brittle automation. I hear two brilliant IIT Delhi undergrads who identified a large market at a moment when foundation model capabilities made it technically accessible. That's smart pattern matching, but it's not the kind of founder-problem fusion I look for when I'm writing my own check. And the fact that Shourya has an incoming McKinsey offer tells me there's optionality here -- a safety net that slightly dampens the "all-in" signal I want to see from a founder asking me to take extraordinary risk alongside them.

The technical approach -- pre-training CUAs on specific interfaces to bypass the slow screenshot-VLM loop -- is genuinely interesting and could represent real differentiation if it delivers on the "10x faster" claim. Vansh's research background in nearest neighbor search and graph neural networks gives him the kind of ML depth that could make this work at the architecture level, not just the application layer. If I squint hard at the bull case, I can see a world where this pre-training approach creates a compounding data moat: every new interface trained adds to a library of UI policies that competitors would need to replicate independently, and the speed advantage compounds as they cover more applications. The incumbents -- UiPath with $1.4 billion in revenue, Automation Anywhere with nearly $7 billion in valuation -- have a real structural conflict: shifting to AI-native CUAs would cannibalize their professional services revenue. That's the kind of business model conflict that sometimes opens a window for insurgents. And the RPA market at $28 billion and growing is undeniably massive. So the bull case exists: a technically exceptional CTO cracks the speed problem, the pre-training moat compounds, and incumbents are too conflicted to respond. But this bull case requires RamAIn to out-execute Simular (which has 50x the funding and a Microsoft distribution partnership), out-open-source Browser Use (50,000+ GitHub stars), and stay ahead of Anthropic and OpenAI as they improve their own computer-use capabilities. That's not one miracle -- it's three simultaneous ones.

What I notice that a generic analyst might miss is the absence of any "invisible system being made visible" dynamic. My best investments -- Carta making cap tables transparent, Affirm revealing hidden credit card fees, Flock Safety bringing public safety data to communities -- share a common thread of taking something opaque and making it legible to people who were being harmed by the opacity. RamAIn is building a better automation tool for enterprise operations teams. That's valuable, but it's an efficiency play for companies, not an access play for people. Nobody is being locked out of economic participation because RPA scripts are brittle. The human impact here is incremental productivity, not the kind of structural access creation that gets me excited enough to write a check from my own money into a pre-seed company facing headwinds this severe.

I respect what these founders have built in terms of credentials at a young age, and YC's acceptance is a meaningful signal. But when I run this through my own framework -- is this weird enough that others are dismissing it? No, they're funding it aggressively. Is the founder's biography inseparable from the problem? Not that I can see. Does this create economic access for underserved populations? Not directly. Is there a regulatory moat that deters competition? Not yet. This is a competent team in a real market that has already become consensus, and I don't have conviction that pre-training on specific interfaces will survive the platform providers moving downstream. I'd pass and wish them well.
