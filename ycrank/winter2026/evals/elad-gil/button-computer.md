# Button Computer -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive graveyard here tells you everything you need to know about the structural moment. Humane raised $240 million, shipped a product, and shut down within a year -- selling its assets to HP for less than half what it raised. Limitless got acquired by Meta rather than continue independently. And now Apple, OpenAI (reportedly with Jony Ive), and Meta are all building AI wearables. When I see a market where a $240M-funded company couldn't survive and three of the largest technology companies on earth are entering simultaneously, that's not a "cleared competitive landscape" -- that's a signal that the standalone form factor may not be a viable independent business category. The dossier frames Humane's exit and Limitless's acquisition as removing competitors. I frame them as evidence that the market absorbs these products into platform ecosystems rather than sustaining them as independent companies.

The "why now" thesis here is generic in a way that concerns me. "LLM inference costs dropped" and "voice quality improved" are true statements, but they're the same "why now" that every AI company cites in 2026. More importantly, those cost and quality improvements benefit Apple integrating ChatGPT into AirPods far more than they benefit a two-person startup selling a Bluetooth button via Shopify. When I invested in Harvey, the structural moment was specific: legal work requires a fidelity threshold that GPT-4 was about to cross, creating a narrow window where purpose-built workflow tools could capture enterprise relationships before incumbents reacted. Button's structural moment is the opposite -- the technology improvements that make voice AI viable are simultaneously enabling the incumbents who already own the distribution channel (hundreds of millions of AirPods and earbuds already in people's ears). That's not a timing advantage. That's a countdown.

The core technology problem is what I'd call "software-aware rather than software-driven." The product architecture is: microphone captures voice, Bluetooth sends to phone, phone calls an LLM API, text-to-speech plays response through speaker. Every component is commodity. The BYO-API-key option on the website actually makes this explicit -- the company is acknowledging that the AI layer is interchangeable. When you can swap out the intelligence behind your product with an API key, the product isn't software-driven, it's a peripheral. I've seen this pattern repeatedly, and the margin structure and defensibility always reflect the underlying commodity nature. Omi is already open-source at $89 with the same basic architecture. That's the tell.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: Humane failed because it overbuilt -- $499, cellular connectivity, a projector, a camera, a subscription. Button succeeds precisely because it underbuilds. At $79-179, it's an impulse purchase that does one thing well: press, talk, get an answer. The founders have genuine Apple hardware experience from Vision Pro, so they understand consumer device quality. And maybe the right analogy isn't Humane but the original Kindle -- a single-purpose device that succeeds specifically because it ignores the feature creep of multipurpose competitors. If Button ships a genuinely delightful product at that price point before Apple integrates voice AI into AirPods, there's a window. But that window requires shipping on time (end of 2026, with a two-person team), achieving consumer adoption through DTC channels with essentially zero distribution infrastructure, AND surviving Apple's integration -- which is three sequential miracles, not one. I don't fund plans that require compounding low-probability events.

The distribution trajectory is what disqualifies this from my framework entirely. Stripe's initial payment API created a developer relationship that distributed Atlas, Billing, Radar, and Treasury. Figma's design tool created a user base that distributed FigJam and developer handoff. What does Button distribute through a clip-on Bluetooth speaker? There's no platform expansion path visible here. The $7.99/month optional subscription is the only recurring revenue, and "optional" is doing a lot of work in that sentence -- users can bring their own API key, which means the company is competing with raw API pricing for its subscription value. The hardware-plus-optional-subscription model at this price point creates a business with thin margins, no distribution moat, and a customer relationship that begins and ends with the physical device. That's structurally capped.

One additional signal that gives me pause: Chris Nolet founded Vibe Code Go in YC S25 and Button Computer in YC W26 -- two different companies in consecutive batches. I've seen founders who iterate rapidly toward product-market fit, and I've seen founders who cycle through ideas without committing to the hard work of making one succeed. The status of Vibe Code Go isn't clear from public information, but the pattern of a mobile vibe-coding app followed immediately by a hardware AI wearable suggests breadth of exploration rather than depth of conviction. The best founders I've backed were obsessively focused on a single problem they understood structurally -- not exploring adjacent categories across consecutive demo days.
