# Crosslayer Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

These founders invented a global internet standard. Not "contributed to" or "participated in" — Henry Birge-Lee coded the first implementation in 2016, published the paper that introduced MPIC at USENIX Security in 2018, co-authored the CA/Browser Forum ballot that mandated it, and watched it get unanimously approved in August 2024. That standard now secures approximately 8 million HTTPS certificates issued every day. I cannot recall another YC company where the founders literally wrote the infrastructure specification that the entire internet now runs on. That's the kind of credential that's impossible to manufacture and impossible to ignore.

The origin of this idea passes every test I care about. Birge-Lee didn't sit down and think "what's a good startup idea in cybersecurity?" He spent a decade proving that BGP attacks can compromise the certificate infrastructure that HTTPS depends on, then invented the fix, then got it mandated globally, and now he's building the monitoring platform that tells enterprises when these attacks are happening in real time. This is organic discovery in its purest form — the idea grew from years of lived research experience, not from market analysis. And the schlep is real. Cross-layer correlation across BGP, DNS, TLS certificates, and JavaScript supply chains requires deep expertise in multiple protocol stacks simultaneously. Cloudflare monitors BGP alone. Certificate Transparency logs monitor TLS alone. Nobody has built the correlation engine because most security engineers are expert in one layer, not four. That's schlep blindness — the problem has been visible for years, but the complexity of working across all layers simultaneously causes most teams to unconsciously scope their solution down to a single layer.

The co-founder relationship is strong. All three have worked together at Princeton's ECE department for years, with Birge-Lee and Cimaszewski co-demonstrating live BGP attacks and collaborating on the Open MPIC Project. Mittal, as advisor-turned-cofounder, brings an ACM Grace Hopper Award and relationships with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Let's Encrypt. This is not a team that met at a hackathon. And Birge-Lee is clearly a hacker who builds — 38 GitHub repos, lead developer of the open-source MPIC implementations that major certificate authorities use in production. Cimaszewski presented at USENIX Security 2023 and contributed to the live attack demonstrations. The technical depth here is legitimate. These are builders, not presenters.

Now the hard question: can they sell? Every founder signal points toward genuine expertise and earnest motivation. But there is zero commercial traction data. No revenue. No customer count. No evidence of enterprise pilots. The website has "Schedule Demo" buttons, but I see no indication anyone has actually bought this. Getting a CA/Browser Forum ballot unanimously approved demonstrates political skill and persistence — navigating that bureaucracy requires convincing dozens of certificate authorities across multiple countries — and that's a meaningful proxy for the kind of institutional selling required in enterprise security. But it's still a proxy. The academic-to-commercial transition is the single biggest risk here. Brilliant researchers who've never sold software, never managed a pipeline, never handled enterprise procurement cycles. YC helps with this, but the gap between publishing at USENIX and closing a six-figure enterprise deal is enormous.

The strongest bull case is compelling: if Birge-Lee and Cimaszewski can learn to sell (and Mittal's network opens doors at the CAs and major tech companies who already trust them from the MPIC work), this team has a moat that is almost impossible to replicate. You cannot hire your way to a decade of published research at USENIX Security and ACM CCS. You cannot fast-track relationships with every major certificate authority. You cannot retroactively invent the standard that the internet adopted. And the MPIC mandate, going into enforcement in September 2025, creates genuine urgency — enterprises are now aware that BGP-based impersonation is a real threat, and they need monitoring beyond what the certificate issuance process alone provides. The market timing is regulatory-driven, not hype-driven, which I trust more. If these founders turn out to be even moderately competent at enterprise sales, the depth of their technical moat could make this a very large security company. The problem is I have no evidence yet that they can make that transition, and "could be great if one thing changes" is the most dangerous sentence in investing.

I'm leaning neutral on this one — fascinated by the organic discovery and the technical depth, concerned by the complete absence of commercial signal and the academic-to-commercial gap. Mittal's likely part-time status as a tenured professor adds uncertainty about operational bandwidth. The narrow attack vector focus is less concerning to me — Stripe started narrow too — but in enterprise security, buyers increasingly want platform consolidation, and a point solution for cross-layer impersonation detection needs to prove its standalone value before it can expand. This is a company I'd want to talk to the founders about. If Birge-Lee demonstrated even basic sales instincts in a conversation — if he could explain this problem to a CISO in plain language and describe specific enterprises he's talked to — I'd probably move to invest. Right now, on the dossier alone, I see exceptional problem-founder fit wrapped in unresolved commercial uncertainty.
