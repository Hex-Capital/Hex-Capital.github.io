# Salus -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is what strikes me immediately about Salus: nobody thinks this is a bad idea. OpenAI is building guardrails into its Agents SDK. NVIDIA released NeMo Guardrails as open source with 5,600 GitHub stars. Galileo has raised $68 million and already offers real-time guardrails alongside evaluation and observability. Fiddler has $100 million and claims sub-100ms latency on its Trust Models. When every incumbent and well-funded competitor is building toward your exact same conclusion, that is not a signal of opportunity — it is a signal that you are attempting something the market has already decided is a feature, not a company. My best investments — Juniper, Impossible Foods, OpenAI — were things that incumbents actively mocked or declared impossible. Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. The food industry said plant-based meat was a joke. When the establishment endorses your thesis before you ship, you have a timing problem dressed up as validation.

Let me start where I always start: if Salus succeeds completely — becomes the standard runtime guardrail for every AI agent deployed globally — what changes? AI agents execute tool calls more safely. Fewer bad refunds, fewer errant emails, fewer incorrect database queries. That is genuinely useful. It is also a feature of the agent platform, not a transformation of any industry. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. No physical reality changes. The meat industry does not collapse. The energy grid does not restructure. The consequence of maximal success is a well-run infrastructure middleware company in a crowded market. I have watched smart people spend their careers on problems exactly this size, and the result is always the same — a business that works but never matters at a scale that justifies the human capital invested.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. Agentic AI is on a legitimate exponential curve — Gartner projects 40% of enterprise applications will embed task-specific agents by 2026, up from under 5% in early 2025. Only 41% of enterprises deploying agents have runtime guardrails in place. The "guardian agent" category could capture 15% of the AI market within four years. If Salus accumulates production data on agent failure modes faster than anyone else, they could build the kind of data moat that Datadog built in monitoring — starting as a narrow tool and expanding into a platform. The 58% blocked-action recovery rate and the benchmark results on ODCV-Bench suggest real engineering depth, not vaporware. Vedant Singh's research portfolio across multiple Stanford labs and MIT RSI, including a multi-agent trading system, demonstrates he has built exactly the kind of systems Salus aims to protect. These are not unimpressive founders — they are intellectually formidable for any age. If the category develops its own complexity — if agent validation turns out to require deep, specialized knowledge that platform vendors underinvest in — then a focused pure-play could win.

But I keep returning to the structural problem. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The core concept — intercepting tool calls and checking them against policies — is architecturally straightforward. Any observability or agent framework vendor with SDK-level access to tool calls could build similar functionality." This is not Juniper building TCP/IP routing when Cisco refused to. This is not Impossible Foods engineering plant-based heme when the food industry said it was impossible. This is a decorator wrapper on a tool call. The technology does not create an economic disruption that makes existing approaches unviable — it adds a validation layer that any framework vendor can replicate as a checkbox feature. When OpenAI ships guardrails natively in its Agents SDK, the value proposition of a third-party interception layer narrows dramatically. Salus has reduced its probability of failure — the technology works, the market exists, the timing is favorable — but in doing so, it has reduced the consequence of success to something I cannot get excited about.

The team composition amplifies this concern. Two Stanford CS undergraduates, roommates, same background — selling runtime infrastructure to enterprise engineering teams competing against Galileo's $68 million war chest and Fiddler's $100 million. Enterprise infrastructure sales requires production reliability guarantees, SLAs, and support infrastructure that are resource-intensive to build. I see no evidence of deliberate team assembly to address the venture's most critical risks: enterprise go-to-market, latency engineering at scale, or competitive differentiation against well-funded incumbents building the same category. The founders are clearly talented — Vedant's research breadth is remarkable for a junior — but talent applied to an insufficiently large problem, in a category that incumbents are already building, is talent that could be better directed elsewhere. I would tell these founders: you are too capable for a problem this bounded. Go find something that the experts say cannot be done.
