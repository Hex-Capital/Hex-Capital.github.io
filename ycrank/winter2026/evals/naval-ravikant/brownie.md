# IncidentFox -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking feature of IncidentFox isn't anything about the company itself -- it's the landscape around it. Resolve AI has raised $160M and was founded by the co-creators of OpenTelemetry. incident.io has $96M and $9M in revenue. NeuBird has $44.5M with Microsoft backing. Datadog is shipping Bits AI. PagerDuty has SRE Agents. When I see five well-funded startups and three incumbents all converging on the same thesis -- "AI can automate incident response" -- I know one thing for certain: the asymmetric upside has already been competed away. Anyone in this business who's chasing hot markets gets killed. This is a hot market. The question isn't whether AI SRE is real. It is. The question is whether two engineers with a few years of experience and a $500K check can outrun a billion dollars of deployed capital in a category where everyone already agrees on the destination.

The specific knowledge question is where I start, and the answer here is honest but unfavorable. Jimmy Wei has a Cornell MS, Meta FAIR research in conversational AI, and infrastructure work at Roblox. Long Yi graduated from Brandeis in 2023 and spent roughly two years on Roblox's stateful infrastructure team. Both experienced on-call chaos firsthand. That's relevant. But relevant experience is not specific knowledge. Millions of engineers have been woken up at 3 AM by a PagerDuty alert. Millions have wished for better tooling. The Resolve AI founders didn't just experience incidents -- they co-created OpenTelemetry, the standard that defines how observability data flows through modern infrastructure. They had exits to Splunk and VMware. That's specific knowledge that took a decade to accumulate. Wei and Yi have a couple years of relevant employment. Smart, capable engineers who identified a genuine pain point -- but that's the definition of a teachable insight. If you can explain the problem in a YC application and any competent engineer nods along, the knowledge isn't specific enough.

The leverage architecture doesn't clear my bar either. IncidentFox automates an existing workflow -- it makes on-call engineers faster at something they already do. That's valuable, but it's not creating a new form of leverage. Compare it to Replit, which enabled people who couldn't code to build software. That's new leverage -- a new category of person doing a new category of work. Or Stack Overflow, which turned individual developer knowledge into a compounding public good. IncidentFox makes existing SREs more efficient at existing tasks. It's an optimization, not a leverage multiplier. The multi-agent orchestration and 300+ integrations represent real engineering, but they're features, not a new capability that previously didn't exist. The vendor-agnostic positioning is the most interesting structural play -- becoming the cross-platform investigation layer that Datadog can't build without undermining its own lock-in. But that's a distribution thesis, not a leverage thesis.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: that the AI SRE market is genuinely pre-consensus despite the funding (everyone's building it, nobody's won yet); that open-source plus vendor-agnostic positioning is structurally correct because enterprises hate single-vendor AI lock-in; and that the per-customer learning flywheel -- each deployment absorbing codebase structure, incident history, team patterns -- creates a data moat that compounds faster than competitors' engineering budgets can replicate. If all three are true, IncidentFox could become the Linux of incident response: the standard that enterprises adopt because it's the only tool that works across their heterogeneous infrastructure stack. The Apache 2.0 licensing would then be an asset, not a liability -- maximum distribution velocity toward a paid enterprise tier. I take this seriously. But the execution gap between "two-person pre-pilot startup" and "open-source standard adopted by enterprises" requires either a decade of patient compounding or a viral adoption curve. The Hacker News launches (3 points and 1 point) suggest the viral curve hasn't ignited, and Long Yi's HBS 2+2 acceptance raises the question of whether a decade of patient compounding is actually the plan.

One more signal concerns me: the YC URL slug "brownie" suggests this team pivoted to IncidentFox from something else. Pivots aren't disqualifying -- many great companies emerged from pivots. But combined with the early-career profile and the consensus category, it suggests founders who are solving a problem they identified rather than one they've been obsessing over for years. The distinction matters. When I backed Twitter, Evan Williams had spent the better part of a decade thinking about public communication tools. He didn't identify the opportunity through market research. He arrived at it through a decade of specific knowledge accumulation. I don't see that depth of obsessive domain immersion here. I see competent engineers building a competent product in a market where competence is table stakes and the incumbents have orders of magnitude more capital, distribution, and domain expertise.

Pass. The founders are capable, the market is real, and the product addresses a genuine pain point. But there's no specific knowledge moat, no new form of leverage, and the timing is pure consensus. I want to invest in companies where the founder knows something that can't be replicated, building capability that didn't exist before, at a moment when the crowd thinks they're wrong. IncidentFox is building something the crowd already agrees should exist, using techniques that are publicly available, in a market where the most credentialed teams in the space have a multi-year and multi-hundred-million-dollar head start.
