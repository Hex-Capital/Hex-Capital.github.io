# Tensol -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first: this is the most popular category in technology right now. AI agents for business. Every VC on Sand Hill Road has this on their thesis slide. Competitors have raised $185 million combined -- 11x alone pulled $74 million from Benchmark and a16z. Salesforce is building Agentforce. Microsoft has Copilot. And Tensol is two people with standard YC funding, building on an open-source framework anyone can download, entering a space where consensus has not only formed -- it has calcified. This is the opposite of what I look for. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. AI employees for business is extremely popular and extremely easy to assess. When I backed SpaceX, people thought private rocketry was insane. When I wrote the check for Crusoe Energy, people thought mining Bitcoin on gas flares was absurd. Nobody is confused by "we help your sales team use AI" -- they just have twelve other companies pitching them the exact same thing.

Before I even get to the product, I want to understand these founders. Tell me the story -- not the business. And what I find is two technically capable young engineers: Oliviero dropped out of his Singapore master's program, built integrations at Stacksync, started a company at nineteen. Pratik earned a CMU AI degree, worked at Rivian, won a $50K venture competition. These are smart people with initiative. But where is the lived experience that makes this problem theirs? I'm listening for the biographical thread -- the thing that happened to them that means they cannot rest until this specific problem is solved. I don't hear it. What I hear instead is a product pivot. They built Solstis, an AI workflow automation tool, won a CMU competition with it in March 2025, and then when OpenClaw exploded to 180,000 GitHub stars in late 2025, they rebranded and rebuilt on top of it. That pivot doesn't tell me "we found our calling." It tells me "we saw what was trending." The founders who persist through the inevitable crises of company-building are the ones whose identity is fused to the problem. These founders seem fused to the technology wave.

The defensibility picture concerns me deeply. Tensol's core runtime is OpenClaw -- open-source, available to every competitor, and whose creator just got acqui-hired by OpenAI, introducing real governance uncertainty. The integration layer is OAuth connectors to standard SaaS tools -- replicable by anyone with a few engineering weeks. The "AI employee" framing is a marketing distinction, not a technical moat. I always look for defensibility early -- it's one of the number one things we look for in the early stages. Where does the moat come from? They suggest accumulated company context creates switching costs over time, but that's aspirational, not demonstrated. No customer testimonials, no case studies, no revenue signal. At pre-seed I don't expect massive traction, but I do expect some evidence that the product creates value someone can't easily get elsewhere.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because I owe every founder that. If OpenClaw becomes the Linux of agent infrastructure -- the dominant open-source standard that everyone builds on -- then being among the first to build a polished, enterprise-ready deployment layer on top of it could be genuinely powerful. Oliviero's direct experience building integration infrastructure at Stacksync is directly relevant to this exact problem. The "pre-configured role-based agents" approach is a real UX insight compared to the workflow-builder paradigm that Lindy and Relevance use -- for a busy startup CTO, deploying an "engineering agent" in five minutes beats designing custom workflows. If these founders execute exceptionally well on reliability and earn enterprise trust faster than the well-funded competitors who are burning capital on outbound sales, there's a path to something real. YC acceptance and Gustaf Alstromer as partner means someone smart saw signal here. But for me to get excited, I'd need to feel that these founders have a biographical reason to keep fighting when the well-funded competitors copy their features, when OpenClaw's governance shifts, when the first enterprise deal falls through. I need to know this problem chose them, not the other way around.

This company also doesn't activate my economic access lens at all. Uber created income for drivers. Postmates for delivery workers. Affirm opened transparent credit to people locked out of the system. Tensol helps companies that already use Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and Salesforce automate their knowledge work. These are already well-resourced organizations. I'm not seeing who gains access to something they didn't have before. I'm not seeing an invisible system being made visible. It's optimization for the already-optimized.

I respect the hustle of two young founders going after a massive market with the YC stamp of approval. But this is exactly the kind of bet I don't make -- a consensus category, well-funded competition, open-source foundation with no proprietary advantage, and founders whose story doesn't explain why they're the ones to win this specific fight. I'm passing.
