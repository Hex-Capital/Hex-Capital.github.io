# Perfectly -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Perfectly in a single sentence: over 100 startups are building AI recruiting tools right now. That number alone tells you this is not an insane idea. It's one of the most consensus applications of AI on the planet — "let's use LLMs to automate the thing recruiters do" is what every MBA student pitches after their first ChatGPT session. When I run my sane-person-insane-idea filter, the founders register as credible — ML scientists from TikTok and Meta, NeurIPS publications, direct experience suffering through 800+ agency-sourced interviews. That's sane. But the idea is also sane. Extremely, painfully, obviously sane. And a sane person with a sane idea is exactly the investment profile I avoid, because the returns are already priced into the market. Alex has $20M. Perfect has $23M. Dover has $20M. Gem has $148M. The "insane idea" premium has been completely arbitraged away by the time you're the fifth or sixth team building this.

The deeper structural issue is that Perfectly fails my most important diagnostic: would this business exist if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. The AI isn't a cherry on top of an already-good business — the AI IS the business. Strip away the LLMs and you have... nothing. No painting crews, no parking infrastructure, no physical assets, no regulatory position. Just prompts hitting LinkedIn's API. When I invested in Craftwork, the thesis was simple: someone still has to hold the paintbrush, and software makes the dispatch and scheduling more efficient. That moat is AI-resistant because AI cannot paint your house. But AI absolutely can source candidates and conduct screening calls — that's literally what foundation models are designed to do. Every quarter, the underlying models get cheaper and more capable, which means every quarter the barrier to building a competitor drops. The moat here is execution speed on a capability that's commoditizing in real time.

I do want to engage honestly with the bull case, because the commission model is structurally more interesting than I initially credited. Most AI recruiting startups are selling SaaS subscriptions — software access — which I've argued repeatedly is a dying model. Perfectly charges on placement, which means they eat their own cooking. You only pay when value is delivered. That's closer to my thesis about software being a business tool rather than a business model — the software enables the placement, but the business model is the placement itself. If Perfectly's matching algorithm genuinely produces 2x interview pass rates at scale, the data flywheel could compound: more placements generate more outcome data, which improves matching, which wins more clients. The founders' recommendation systems backgrounds from TikTok and Meta are directly relevant here — candidate-job matching is a recommendation problem, and these are people who worked on the most sophisticated recommendation engines ever built. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that matching quality diverges dramatically between competitors, that one algorithm can become measurably and sustainably better, and that hiring managers will consolidate around whichever system produces the best hires. I find this plausible but not compelling, because the underlying AI capabilities are converging, not diverging — everyone has access to the same foundation models, and the matching quality gap between competent implementations is narrowing every month.

The protocol-versus-application test is where this completely falls apart for me. LinkedIn is the protocol layer in recruiting. It's where the candidate data lives. Perfectly is a DApp built on LinkedIn's infrastructure, using LinkedIn's data, competing with LinkedIn Recruiter's own AI capabilities. LinkedIn could build everything Perfectly does as a feature update. The reusable candidate screening profiles are an interesting idea — candidates complete an AI screen once and carry it to future opportunities — but that only becomes a primitive if it reaches critical mass, and LinkedIn is far better positioned to establish that standard than a three-person pre-seed startup. When I backed Venmo, I was backing a new payment primitive. When I backed Aleo, I was backing a new privacy protocol. Perfectly isn't creating a new layer that others build on — it's an application competing with dozens of other applications on someone else's platform, in a market where the platform owner has every incentive and capability to absorb the functionality.

The founders are technically sharp, the market is real, and the commission model shows more structural sophistication than most AI recruiting startups. But this is my pass archetype distilled: a tech company with a recruiter paint layer, not a recruiting company with a tech layer. The structural logic points clearly toward commoditization, not compounding.
