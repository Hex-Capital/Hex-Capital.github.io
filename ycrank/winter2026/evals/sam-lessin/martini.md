# Martini -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Martini in a single sentence: it's a software orchestration layer that sits between commodity inputs (third-party AI model APIs that anyone can call) and commodity outputs (video files that play anywhere), with no proprietary technology, no physical-world operations, and no protocol position. This is the exact topology I've been publicly arguing will get destroyed. When I say "software is a business tool, not a business model," Martini is the case study I'm imagining. The company doesn't train models. It doesn't own cameras. It doesn't employ film crews. It wraps other people's AI in a prettier interface and charges a margin on pass-through generation costs. That's a feature, not a company.

Let me address the founder pairing, because it's the one thing that gave me pause. Koh Terai is a Cannes-screened cinematographer with a CS degree from NYU Abu Dhabi and a Stanford design MS -- that's a genuinely rare combination of creative credibility and technical fluency. Long Hoang has real engineering chops (robotics championships, Supabase contributions, 1.9K-star repos). The "sane" half of my filter checks out: these are credible people who understand both filmmaking workflows and how to build software. But the "insane" half fails completely. "Figma for AI video" is not an insane idea -- it's the most obvious idea in the most obvious category. Every design tool investor, every AI fund, every media-focused VC hears this pitch and immediately gets it. That's a death sentence in my framework. When everybody nods along, the opportunity has already been priced in by the market. Runway has $860M and is targeting $300M in annualized revenue. Luma raised over a billion dollars. Adobe invested in Runway's Series E and owns Premiere Pro -- the very NLE that Martini exports to. The consensus enthusiasm is the problem.

Now apply my AI kill test: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is obviously no -- without generative video models, there's no product. The AI IS the business. That's the precise inverse of my "cherry on top" framework. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is painting crews and operational logistics, and AI just makes dispatch more efficient. Or Metropolis, where the moat is installed parking infrastructure. Martini has no equivalent physical or operational layer. When Veo 4 ships with native cinematography controls -- and it will, because Google has every incentive to make its model the easiest to use directly -- what's left of the orchestration layer? When Adobe builds native AI generation into Premiere Pro -- and they will, they literally invested in Runway -- what's left of the NLE export value proposition?

The bull case deserves a real paragraph because there is one. Professional creative tools can develop genuinely sticky workflows -- Figma won against Sketch not on technology but on collaboration habits and team muscle memory. If Martini becomes the workspace where production teams collaborate on AI-generated content, and if the multi-model fragmentation persists (ten competing models where different ones excel at different shot types), then the orchestration layer could become a genuine routing standard. The cinematographer-founder's domain expertise in camera controls, lens selection, and professional workflow is non-trivial to replicate -- Runway's team are ML researchers, not filmmakers. There's a version of this story where model companies stay focused on model quality and leave workflow to specialists, similar to how AWS didn't kill Datadog. And 200+ films created on the platform, with productions that aired as TV commercials, is real usage for a pre-seed company. If the team could build proprietary capabilities on top of the orchestration layer -- their own fine-tuned models, proprietary shot-matching algorithms, a library of reusable assets with network effects -- the story could evolve. But right now, none of those moat-deepening mechanics are visible in the dossier.

The Birchbox lesson haunts me here. Birchbox had a beautiful narrative -- reinventing product discovery through curation -- and genuine early traction. What it didn't have was a structural moat. The subscription box model was trivially replicable, and when competitors flooded in, there was nothing defensible underneath the story. Martini's orchestration layer has the same vulnerability: the UX can be copied by any team with filmmaking consultants and engineering talent, the API integrations are public, and the collaborative features are table stakes in modern SaaS. Narrative magnitude without structural moat produces the worst venture outcome -- a company too interesting to die quickly but too fragile to compound. I'd need to see Martini building something that gets harder to replicate over time, not easier, and right now the trajectory points the wrong direction as model providers improve their native interfaces.
