# Traverse -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Traverse: there are more than 35 companies building RL environments right now, and the incumbents already sitting at the table include Scale AI at a $29 billion valuation with $870 million in revenue and Mechanize working directly with Anthropic backed by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. When I look at my own portfolio -- SpaceX when everyone laughed at private rockets, Contraline when male birth control made VCs squirm, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a fever dream -- the pattern is clear. I invest in things nobody else wants to fund. RL environments for frontier AI labs is the opposite of that. This is one of the most competed categories in all of AI infrastructure. Every sophisticated investor I know is looking at this space. The consensus has already formed, the price has been bid up, and the weirdness has been completely arbitraged away.

When I try to understand the founders' connection to this problem, I hit a wall. Lance Yan dropped out of Waterloo after a semester and worked at Kalshi; Zachary Yu built some impressive side projects and worked at Mercor and Uber AI Solutions. Both are clearly talented engineers with ML exposure. But the company was called Clice AI -- personal AI agents for team coordination -- until very recently, when it pivoted to Traverse during or near the YC batch. That pivot is the part I can't get past. My whole process starts with "tell me your story, not the business," and I'm listening for the biographical thread that makes this founder inseparable from this problem. What I see instead is two smart young engineers who noticed the RL environment market was exploding and repositioned. That's pattern recognition, which I respect, but it's not the kind of deep commitment forged through personal experience that I need to feel before writing a check. When I backed the Crusoe team, they'd independently arrived at an insight about waste gas and computation that grew organically from their own obsession with energy physics. They didn't pivot into it because Wing VC published an analysis saying labs were spending tens of millions on RL environments.

The non-deterministic verifier angle is the one genuinely interesting idea here. It's true that RL works beautifully for math and coding because you can verify outputs objectively, and it's true that most economically valuable work -- law, medicine, creative judgment -- doesn't have clean right answers. If someone cracks the verifier problem for taste-dependent domains, that could be extraordinarily valuable. I want to be honest about that bull case. What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? You'd need to believe that building verifiers for subjective work is a fundamentally different skill than what Scale AI and Surge AI have built for deterministic labeling -- that the organizational DNA required is so different that a two-person team with fresh eyes could outcompete companies with billions in resources and existing lab relationships. You'd need to believe that Lance and Zach have a unique technical insight into this problem that they haven't yet demonstrated publicly but will become apparent through their YC work. And you'd need to believe the customer concentration risk -- selling to maybe five frontier labs who could build this in-house any quarter -- won't kill them before they can prove it. Each of those beliefs is possible. Together, they require several things to go right simultaneously, and I don't invest on the basis of needing multiple miracles.

I also don't see the economic access dimension that runs through almost everything in my portfolio. Uber created income for drivers. Postmates created income for delivery workers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out of the system. Carta made equity visible. When I ask myself who benefits from better RL environments for frontier AI labs, the answer is... frontier AI labs. The downstream argument -- that better models eventually help everyone -- is real but it's several layers removed from the direct impact I look for. There's nobody whose life gets tangibly better tomorrow because Traverse exists, no invisible system being made transparent, no economic access being created for people who currently lack it.

Lance and Zach share a Waterloo CS background, which gives them a common foundation, and the team is small enough that co-founder dynamics are manageable for now. But I have no signal on how they handle disagreement or crisis, and the pivot itself -- while it could reflect healthy adaptation -- doesn't tell me whether they'll stick with this specific direction when the RL environment market inevitably gets harder. At pre-seed I weight the founder story above everything else, and what I'm missing here is the biographical grit and the conviction born from personal stakes that would make me want to be their first check. These are capable builders chasing a hot market, and that's just not my kind of bet.
