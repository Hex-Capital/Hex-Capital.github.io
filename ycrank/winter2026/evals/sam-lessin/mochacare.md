# MochaCare -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The first thing I notice about MochaCare is that the pitch leads with AI. "AI-powered scheduling and hiring service for home care agencies." When a company's primary self-description is its AI capability, I reach for my kill switch. My test is ruthless and simple: strip away the AI -- what's left? A managed scheduling and hiring service for home care agencies. That business exists. It's called a BPO or a staffing coordination firm. It works, but it's not a venture-scale business -- the whole bet is that AI automation improves margins over time, turning a services-business cost structure into something approaching software margins. That's not "cherry on top" -- that's AI as the load-bearing wall. If the next wave of AI commoditization makes scheduling optimization trivial (and it will), the moat is whatever operational expertise MochaCare's human team has accumulated. That's a real business, but it's not the kind of structural position I write checks for.

On the founder-idea pairing: Nick Walker is credibly sane -- Stanford CS with deep learning and NLP coursework, stints at AWS, Spotify, Microsoft, Linktree. He's technically capable. The personal motivation -- raised by grandparents, drawn to serve the aging population -- signals authentic domain commitment, which I respect. But the idea itself is not insane. It's the opposite. Caregiver scheduling is the number-one priority for 51% of home care agencies. Every incumbent in the space -- WellSky, AlayaCare, AxisCare, HHAeXchange -- is already building AI features. "AI for home care scheduling" is the kind of pitch that gets heads nodding in a YC interview room, not the kind that gets you laughed out. I'm looking for Brian Armstrong walking into a room in 2012 talking about building a regulated cryptocurrency exchange when everyone thought Bitcoin was a joke. This is not that. The co-founders also have no visible pre-existing relationship -- different universities, no shared employer history. That's not disqualifying, but it doesn't give me confidence about resilience under pressure.

The strongest structural argument for MochaCare is the Craftwork comparison -- and I'll engage with it honestly, because this is the bull case. Craftwork's moat is operational: painting crews, scheduling, quality control. Software makes it better but can't replace the physical work. MochaCare's "Mocha Managed" offering creates a similar dynamic -- once an agency's scheduling and hiring operations flow through MochaCare's team and tools, ripping it out is painful. The business model conflict with incumbents is real: WellSky and AlayaCare sell high-margin software and have zero incentive to stand up a lower-margin managed-services organization. That structural disincentive is the most interesting thing in the dossier. If MochaCare could achieve genuine data network effects across hundreds of agencies -- better caregiver matching, better demand forecasting, better retention predictions -- while maintaining the operational stickiness of the managed layer, you could tell an expansion story from home care scheduling to full home care operations to broader healthcare staffing infrastructure. For this to work, though, the automation ratio would need to be exceptionally high (north of 80% of scheduling decisions fully automated), and the agency-specific data would need to compound meaningfully. There's no evidence either condition is met or approaching.

But the Craftwork analogy breaks down on a critical point: Craftwork employs the painters. The operational moat is that Craftwork has the actual workforce. MochaCare doesn't employ the caregivers -- it coordinates scheduling for agencies that employ them. The human-in-the-loop layer is MochaCare's coordination team, not the service delivery workforce. That's a fundamentally thinner operational position. And MochaCare's "complement, don't replace" strategy -- integrating with WellSky, AxisCare, AlayaCare rather than replacing them -- means it's building on someone else's platform layer. If WellSky decides to restrict API access tomorrow, or acquires a managed-services startup (WellSky already bought ClearCare in 2019, HHAeXchange swallowed four companies in 2024 alone), MochaCare's integration layer evaporates. You're not creating a new primitive here. You're creating a services add-on to existing primitives. That's an application on infrastructure someone else controls, and in my hierarchy, applications get absorbed.

The market is real -- aging demographics, caregiver shortages, 75% turnover -- but real markets with obvious pain points attract real competitors. The AI scheduling and ATS components are exactly the features that become table stakes within twelve months. The narrative expansion path exists in theory (home care ops → healthcare staffing → all healthcare operations) but the managed-services model scales linearly: more agencies require more human coordinators until the automation proves itself. That's a ceiling on the "infinity story." I don't see the compounding network effects that would make each new agency on the platform exponentially more valuable to existing agencies. Each relationship is essentially bilateral.

This is a competent team attacking a genuine problem with a reasonable approach. It's not a bad business. But it's a sane person with a sane idea in a hot market -- the structural logic doesn't produce the kind of non-consensus return profile I'm looking for. I'd rather fund someone building the underlying scheduling protocol that companies like MochaCare would build on.
