# Ishiki Labs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that jumps out at me about Ishiki Labs: these founders literally built the exact system they're now starting a company around. Amit Yadav trained multimodal LLMs on the LLaMA team and built video assistants for Meta's smart glasses. Robert Xu spent four years architecting the orchestration layer for running those multimodal assistants on Orion at the latencies required for real-world use. That's an extraordinary credential match -- they didn't just work adjacent to this problem, they were the people solving it inside one of the best-resourced AI labs on the planet. And then they left to build... an AI meeting assistant. That's where my enthusiasm collapses. Because this isn't a sane person with an insane idea. This is a sane person with the most consensus idea in the 2025-2026 YC landscape.

The AI meeting assistant space isn't a frontier -- it's a battlefield that's already been fought over. Otter.ai hit $100M ARR. Fireflies reached a billion-dollar valuation. Granola raised $67 million. Read.ai raised $81 million. Every one of these companies started with a variant of "we make meetings better with AI." Ishiki's specific angle -- the assistant knows when to shut up -- is genuinely clever as a product insight, but it's a feature, not a structural position. It's like saying your email client's differentiator is better spam filtering. True, useful, and trivially replicable the moment OpenAI ships the next voice mode update with improved turn-taking. Microsoft Copilot is already doing real-time meeting assistance inside Teams with a captive user base of hundreds of millions. The "social awareness" gap isn't a moat -- it's a 12-month head start at best.

This company fails my most basic structural test: would this business exist if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. AI isn't the cherry on top here -- AI is the sundae, the bowl, and the spoon. That's the exact category I've been publicly warning about since 2024. The winner of the AI race depends on consumer distribution, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta have distribution that no startup can replicate. When I invested in Craftwork, the painting company, the whole point was that nobody can ship an LLM that paints your house. The physical crews, the scheduling complexity, the quality control -- software makes all of that better, but software can't replace it. Ishiki Labs has no physical-world anchor. The entire product is a software layer processing audio and video streams through foundation model APIs. Every improvement in those foundation models simultaneously helps Ishiki and helps every competitor, including the platforms themselves.

The strongest bull case -- and I want to take it seriously because the founders genuinely deserve it -- is that "social awareness" in multimodal AI turns out to be a deeply hard research problem that can't be solved by prompting or fine-tuning commodity models. If the Meta smart glasses experience gave Amit and Robert proprietary insight into the architecture required for contextual silence -- something that requires novel model design rather than application-layer engineering -- then maybe there's a technical moat that compounds. If Fern becomes the default real-time copilot for, say, enterprise sales teams before Zoom or Teams figures out the social awareness layer, the habit formation and personalization data could create genuine switching costs. And the narrative could expand from "meeting copilot" to "always-on professional AI companion" -- which is an infinity story. But for that to work, Ishiki would need to own a new primitive in social awareness, not just be first to market with a feature. I see no evidence of that primitive position. No protocol, no data standard, no layer that other applications would build on top of. It's an application, dependent on someone else's infrastructure, in a market where every major platform is actively building the same capability.

The founders are exceptional. The domain fit is as tight as I've ever seen at pre-seed. But the structural logic is exactly backwards from what I look for. I want businesses that get stronger as AI gets cheaper -- and this is a business that gets more commoditized as AI gets cheaper. Every foundation model improvement narrows the gap between Ishiki's social awareness capability and what any developer can build with the latest API release. I'd love to back Amit and Robert on something where their multimodal AI expertise is the cherry on top of an operationally complex, AI-resistant business. But an AI-first meeting tool competing against incumbents with tens of millions of users and platform owners with captive distribution? That's a feature in search of an acquisition, not a company in search of a category.
