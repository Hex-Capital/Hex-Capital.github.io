## The Idea

**Problem:** Patent attorneys and IP teams spend weeks on manual document review, prior art research, freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis, and patent monitoring. The existing workflow relies on disconnected point solutions and high-stakes manual processes. General-purpose LLMs generate text but lack the traceability, source-backing, and auditability required for legal-grade patent work (YC company page). Current tools include legacy patent analytics platforms (Clarivate, LexisNexis, Anaqua) and newer AI drafting tools, but these are described by the company as "rigid" and failing to integrate AI with clear traceability (YC company page).

**Approach:** Stilta is an AI-native workspace for IP teams, built on agentic workflows. Rather than offering a single-function tool (e.g., drafting only or search only), the product aims to cover patent work end-to-end — including FTO analysis, patent monitoring, and IP strategy optimization (LinkedIn post by Tobias Estreen, Jan 14, 2026). Every AI output is source-backed, referenced, and auditable to meet legal-grade requirements. The company claims practitioners can reduce manual work by up to ~60% (YC company page).

**Differentiation:** Stilta positions itself as an end-to-end AI-native workspace, as opposed to competitors that focus on individual steps of the patent lifecycle. Solve Intelligence ($55M raised, YC alum) covers patent drafting, prosecution, and claim charting but originated as a drafting tool. DeepIP ($15M raised) focuses on AI-assisted drafting embedded in Microsoft Word. Patlytics ($21M raised) focuses on patent intelligence and analytics. Stilta's framing as "Cursor for patent attorneys" implies a developer-tools-inspired UX paradigm — an integrated workspace with AI-driven workflows rather than a suite of separate features. The traceability and auditability emphasis also distinguishes it from general-purpose LLM tools.

**Business Model:** No public pricing page was accessible at time of research (website requires JavaScript rendering and did not load content). [Inferred]: Given the B2B SaaS model (Nordic9 categorization) and competitor pricing benchmarks ($199–$1,499/user/month for comparable tools like Dolcera and Rowan Patents), the most likely monetization path is per-seat SaaS subscription pricing for patent teams and law firms.

**TAM/SAM:** The global patent analytics market was valued at $1.0 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2032 at a 14% CAGR (Allied Market Research via search snippet). A separate estimate places the market at $1.26 billion in 2025, reaching $3.72 billion by 2034 (Global Growth Insights via search snippet). The broader intellectual property management software market is valued at $13.61 billion in 2025, projected to reach $24.82 billion by 2030 at 12.91% CAGR (Mordor Intelligence via search snippet). DeepIP estimates the global IP law services industry at $42 billion/year, with an immediately addressable market of $1.3 billion (DeepIP blog, Mar 2025 via search snippet).

**GTM / Distribution:** The company states it is "already live with leading firms in both Europe and the US" (YC company page). LinkedIn posts from January 2026 reference actively onboarding early users for FTO and monitoring workflows (Tobias Estreen LinkedIn, Jan 14, 2026). The team relocated from Stockholm to San Francisco in January 2026 (Petrus Werner LinkedIn, Jan 2, 2026). YC partner Gustaf Alströmer and James Evans are named backers (Tobias Estreen LinkedIn, Jan 14, 2026). [Inferred]: Distribution likely combines direct sales to patent law firms and corporate IP departments, leveraging McKinsey consulting network connections for enterprise introductions.

## Defensibility

The company's emphasis on source-backed, auditable AI outputs for legal-grade workflows suggests a product designed around domain-specific trust requirements that general-purpose LLMs do not inherently meet. If Stilta accumulates proprietary patent analysis workflows and integrations with firm-specific processes, switching costs could develop over time as practitioners build workflows around the platform. The "agentic workspace" approach — covering the full patent lifecycle rather than a single task — could create stickiness if users consolidate multiple tools into one.

No defensibility signals from public sources were found regarding patents filed by the company, proprietary datasets, or network effects. [Inferred]: Potential moat could develop via (1) workflow lock-in as firms integrate Stilta into their end-to-end processes, (2) accumulation of domain-specific fine-tuning data from user interactions across patent workflows, and (3) compliance/audit trail features that become embedded in firm processes.

**Market structure:** Legacy incumbents (Clarivate, LexisNexis, Anaqua) have large installed bases but are built on traditional search and document management architectures. [Inferred]: Structural barriers for incumbents include: (1) business model cannibalization — incumbents charge for database access and search queries, while an AI-native workflow tool changes the value proposition from data access to automated analysis; (2) technical architecture — rebuilding legacy platforms around agentic AI workflows requires fundamental re-architecture rather than incremental feature additions; and (3) sales channel conflict — incumbent sales teams optimize for database/analytics contracts, not workflow automation tooling sold to individual practitioners.

**Commoditization risk:** Multiple well-funded startups are building AI tools for patent work: Solve Intelligence ($55M total, YC alum, profitable with 8-figure ARR per company blog, Dec 2025), DeepIP ($15M raised, 7-figure ARR in 7 months per company blog, Mar 2025), and Patlytics ($21M raised, 20x ARR growth in 6 months per TechCrunch, Feb 2025). The underlying LLM capabilities are broadly available. Differentiation depends on workflow integration depth, domain-specific prompt engineering, and trust/auditability features rather than foundational model access. The space is becoming increasingly competitive.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **Solve Intelligence** (YC alum) — $55M total raised ($40M Series B, Dec 2025; $12M Series A, Apr 2025). Profitable with 8-figure ARR; 10x ARR growth since Series A (Solve Intelligence blog, Dec 2025). Covers patent drafting, prosecution, office actions, claim charting. Key differentiator vs. Stilta: more mature product focused on drafting and prosecution workflows with litigation charting; Stilta positions as a broader end-to-end workspace rather than a task-specific tool.

2. **DeepIP** — $15M Series A (Mar 2025), led by Resonance with Headline and Serena Capital. Reached 7-figure ARR in 7 months; 8,500 patents drafted on platform (DeepIP blog, Mar 2025). Founded 2024, NYC/Paris-based. Key differentiator vs. Stilta: embedded in Microsoft Word as a drafting assistant; Stilta is a standalone workspace rather than an add-on to existing tools.

3. **Patlytics** — $21M total ($14M Series A, Feb 2025; $4.5M seed, Apr 2024), led by Next47 with Gradient (Google). 20x ARR increase and 18x customer base expansion in 6 months; 300% MoM growth (TechCrunch, Feb 2025). Founded Jan 2024, NYC-based. Key differentiator vs. Stilta: focuses on patent intelligence/analytics (infringement detection, invalidity analysis, SEP analysis); Stilta targets broader IP workflow including FTO and monitoring.

4. **IPRally** — $10.8M Series A (TechCrunch, Mar 2023). Finland-based patent search engine using knowledge graph and explainable AI. Customers include Nvidia, Dolby, Bentley (TechCrunch, Mar 2023). Key differentiator vs. Stilta: focused specifically on patent search and classification using graph-based AI; Stilta targets end-to-end IP workflow.

5. **Rowan Patents** — Acquired by Clarivate in Jul 2024. Integrated patent drafting and prosecution solution at ~$500/seat/month (deepip.ai competitor review via search snippet). Key differentiator vs. Stilta: now part of Clarivate's legacy IP stack; Stilta is an independent AI-native platform.

**Why now:** [Inferred]: The primary catalyst is the crossing of an LLM capability threshold in 2023–2025 that made reliable, source-grounded patent analysis feasible for the first time. Prior AI tools could search and classify patents but could not generate auditable analytical outputs at the quality required for legal work. The emergence of agentic AI frameworks (multi-step reasoning, tool use) in 2024–2025 enables end-to-end workflow automation rather than single-task assistance. Simultaneously, patent filing volumes continue to grow (3.4 million applications worldwide in 2023, per WIPO via search snippet) while the supply of patent attorneys has not scaled proportionally, creating capacity pressure in IP departments and law firms.

**Co-founder relationship:** All four founders have McKinsey/QuantumBlack as a shared employer. Oskar Block worked at McKinsey; Tobias Estreen led AI projects at QuantumBlack (McKinsey's AI division); Petrus Werner scaled AI systems at QuantumBlack; and Oscar Adamsson worked with CEOs at McKinsey. Additionally, the company was originally based in Stockholm, Sweden, suggesting shared geographic roots. Tobias Estreen and Petrus Werner both appear to have overlapped at QuantumBlack specifically.

**Founder-market fit:** The team of four engineers from McKinsey/QuantumBlack brings experience deploying AI systems for large enterprises — relevant to building trusted, auditable AI workflows for legal-grade patent work. Oskar Block's experience at Goldman Sachs and scaling two bootstrapped ventures to $1M+ ARR indicates operational and GTM experience. Petrus Werner's AWS background adds scalable infrastructure expertise. Tobias Estreen's physics/ML academic background and QuantumBlack AI project leadership provide technical depth. Oscar Adamsson's product experience at unicorns and McKinsey CEO-level consulting provides client-facing and product development experience. No advisors, board members, or notable investors beyond YC and partners Gustaf Alströmer and James Evans were found.

## Key Risks

**Heavily funded, fast-scaling competitors:** Solve Intelligence ($55M raised, profitable, 8-figure ARR), DeepIP ($15M raised, 7-figure ARR in 7 months), and Patlytics ($21M raised, 300% MoM growth) are all well-funded and scaling rapidly in the same AI patent tooling space. These companies have 12–18 months of head start and substantially more capital. Stilta's end-to-end positioning must demonstrate clear superiority over these specialized tools to win practitioners away from established alternatives.

**No visible domain expertise in patent law:** None of the four founders have documented backgrounds in patent law, IP prosecution, or legal practice. The team is strong in AI/ML engineering and management consulting, but patent work has highly specialized domain requirements (claim construction, prosecution strategy, jurisdictional nuances). Mitigation: the company states it is "already live with leading firms," suggesting domain knowledge may be embedded through customer collaboration, but no patent attorneys or IP specialists are listed on the team.

**Trust and adoption barriers in legal workflows:** Patent attorneys operate under professional liability constraints and malpractice exposure. AI-generated analysis must meet extremely high accuracy thresholds for legal adoption. A single high-profile error (e.g., missed prior art leading to patent invalidation) could damage adoption broadly. The company's emphasis on traceability and auditability addresses this, but the threshold for trust in legal AI remains high.

**European-to-US market transition:** The founding team is Swedish, originally based in Stockholm, and relocated to San Francisco in January 2026 (Petrus Werner LinkedIn, Jan 2, 2026). While they state traction in both Europe and the US, building sales relationships with US law firms — which represent the largest patent market — requires US-specific legal knowledge, networks, and credibility that the team is still developing.

**Platform breadth vs. depth tradeoff:** Stilta's end-to-end workspace positioning (FTO, monitoring, strategy) means building across multiple patent workflow verticals simultaneously. Competitors like Solve Intelligence and DeepIP have focused on one or two workflows and achieved significant traction. Spreading across multiple capabilities with a 4-person team risks delivering none at the depth required for legal-grade work.
