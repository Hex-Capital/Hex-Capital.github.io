# Didit -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what's genuinely fascinating about Didit: these founders started in exactly the right place and then walked away from it. Gamium was a blockchain identity protocol -- a decentralized, wallet-based identity primitive. That's a protocol-layer play. The kind of thing where if it works, every application built on top increases your value. Then they pivoted to... selling per-verification API calls at fifteen cents a pop in competition with Persona, Sumsub, Veriff, and every other KYC vendor with ten to a hundred times more capital. They moved from building infrastructure that others build on to building an application that competes on price. From my framework, that's going the wrong direction on a one-way street.

The sane-person-insane-idea calibration fails here, but not in the way people expect me to say. The Rosas twins are clearly credible -- mathematics degrees, ML engineering chops (Alberto's StyleGAN2 repo has 143 stars, which tells me he actually builds things), Oracle data science background for Alejandro, and they've shipped real product. They're sane. The problem is the idea is also sane. Aggressively sane. "Make KYC cheaper and easier to integrate" is not a thesis that provokes confusion or skepticism from other investors. It's a thesis that provokes bidding wars. Persona just raised $418M at $2B. Veriff is a unicorn. Sumsub does $86M in revenue. When every VC on Sand Hill Road agrees that identity verification is a massive, growing market -- and it is, $14B heading to $30B -- you've lost the non-consensus premium entirely. You're buying narrative at market price.

Now, the traction numbers are legitimately impressive and I want to be honest about that. 700+ active B2B customers with 20% month-over-month growth, 300%+ net revenue retention by month six, close to profitability on just $2M raised -- that's exceptional operational execution for a pre-seed company. The revenue cushion here is real. These aren't vanity metrics. But I learned this lesson with Birchbox and I'll keep learning it: traction in a structurally exposed position is a trap. The subscription box metrics looked phenomenal right up until twenty competitors launched identical products. In identity verification, the core technology stack -- OCR, biometric matching, liveness detection -- is commoditizing in real-time. The dossier says it plainly: "the underlying technology stack is increasingly available via open-source models and cloud AI services." Didit's pricing advantage is a function of being lean and subsidizing a free tier. Sumsub or Persona can match that pricing tomorrow if they decide the SMB long tail matters enough, and they have the distribution to make it stick.

The structural moat question is where this company runs directly into my thesis about software defensibility. The free tier of 500 verifications per month is clever distribution, but it's a pricing strategy, not a moat. As AI inference costs continue to crater, every competitor can offer free basic KYC. What happens to your differentiation when the thing that makes you special becomes table stakes? The compliance certifications (ISO 27001, iBeta) are necessary but not unique -- the incumbents hold the same certs. The 14,000+ document types across 220+ countries is a real asset, but it's an asset that grows linearly with engineering investment, not one that compounds through network effects. This is software defending software, and that's exactly the game AI is dismantling.

The bull case I'd want to believe -- the scenario where I'm wrong to pass -- centers on the reusable KYC concept. If Didit's consumer identity wallet achieves critical mass, where a person verifies once and carries that credential across platforms, then Didit isn't a verification vendor anymore. It's an identity primitive. That's the Venmo analogy: peer-to-peer payments seemed like a feature until the social graph around money became its own infrastructure. If Didit could establish "verify once, accepted everywhere" as a standard, that's a protocol position with genuine network effects -- each new business accepting Didit credentials increases the value for every verified user, which attracts more businesses, which attracts more users. The Orange/GSMA Open Gateway partnership hints at this direction. But here's the thing: this is aspirational, not operational. Today, the revenue comes from per-verification API calls. The consumer app exists on iOS and Android but there's no adoption data. And the founders deliberately pivoted AWAY from the protocol architecture (Gamium's blockchain identity) toward the SaaS architecture. If they believed in the primitive play, they had it and abandoned it.

The competitive landscape seals this for me. Persona at $2B valuation with Gartner leadership and $418M in war chest. Veriff as a unicorn doing 75% year-over-year revenue growth. Sumsub at $86M revenue with its own Gartner recognition. Onfido absorbed by Entrust for $650M, gaining the resources of a major security conglomerate. Didit is bringing $2M and 12 people to a fight where the other side has hundreds of millions and thousands of enterprise relationships. The free tier might win the SMB long tail, but the SMB long tail in regulated identity verification is a tough business -- high support costs, low willingness to pay, churn when they grow into enterprises that want Persona-grade compliance infrastructure. This is a market where the founders' operational intensity is evident but where the structural position doesn't compound in their favor.
