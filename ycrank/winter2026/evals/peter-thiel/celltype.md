# CellType -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of CellType is not the technology itself but the structural paradox at its center: they co-developed their core 27-billion-parameter model with Google DeepMind, received personal amplification from Sundar Pichai reaching seven million people, and built on Google's own Gemma architecture -- while Google simultaneously funds Isomorphic Labs, a $600 million drug discovery subsidiary pursuing overlapping territory. This is either the most powerful validation imaginable or an existential threat dressed as an endorsement. When I co-founded Palantir, we built our technology independently and sold it to the intelligence community. We never co-developed our core IP with an entity that was also our potential competitor. CellType has handed their foundational insight to the most powerful AI research organization on earth and published the methodology at ICML for anyone to read. The models sit on Hugging Face. The code has 809 stars on GitHub. If this is a secret, it is the most publicly shared secret in the history of drug discovery.

The question I always ask first -- what is the secret here? -- yields a layered answer. The outer thesis, that AI will transform drug discovery, is not a secret at all. It is consensus dressed in lab coats. Isomorphic Labs, Recursion, Insilico Medicine, Valo Health -- billions have been deployed on this exact proposition. When a dozen well-funded companies and every major pharmaceutical R&D department all agree that AI-driven drug discovery is the future, there is no contrarian insight, only a crowded market. The inner thesis is more interesting: that single-cell gene expression data can be serialized into natural language and processed by LLMs, enabling models to "reason" about cellular biology in a way that molecular-structure approaches cannot. Cell2Sentence is a genuinely novel representation -- converting the transcriptome into ordered gene names that language models can parse. Most computational biologists I know would argue that this serialization discards critical biological information: pathway interactions, spatial context, epigenetic state, post-translational modifications. The fact that the approach is non-obvious and debatable is what gives it some flavor of a real secret. But the question is whether it is important enough, and defensible enough, to build a monopoly.

The monopoly test is where CellType fails most clearly. I see none of the four structural characteristics of durable monopoly. Proprietary technology? The core is open-source. Network effects? Pharma partnerships are bilateral contracts, not network-effect businesses. Economies of scale? Google has more compute than CellType will ever have. Brand? "CellType" is a common biology term that returns noise in every search. The competitive landscape looks like the food delivery wars applied to biology: multiple well-capitalized players pursuing variations of the same meta-thesis, competing for the same pharmaceutical partnerships, with no structural mechanism that allows any single player to achieve unassailable dominance. Insilico already has a drug in Phase II clinical trials. Recursion has $43 million in trailing revenue. Valo has a $4.6 billion deal with Novo Nordisk. CellType has a YC page claiming "Top 10 pharma" engagement with zero verifiable revenue. The mimetic dynamics are clear and destructive.

David van Dijk is the strongest element of this company. An associate professor at Yale with nearly nine thousand citations, creator of MAGIC and PHATE -- two of the most widely used methods in single-cell computational biology -- with an NSF CAREER Award in 2025. He turned down a position at Google to build CellType, which is the kind of path-refusal I value. This is not a consultant in a suit; this is a genuine technical mind with deep domain authority. But domain authority in an academic field is different from the kind of definite optimism I look for in founders. The articulated vision -- "AI agents do the work, humans steer the science" -- is a description of a methodology, not a specific plan for how the world will be different when CellType succeeds. Compare this to Musk's vision for SpaceX (specific plan for reusable rockets, then Mars colonization) or Zuckerberg's vision for Facebook (connect every person on earth through real identity). What does the world look like in ten years if CellType achieves everything it aims to? The answer appears to be "drug discovery is faster and cheaper" -- which is an outcome every company in the space claims. I want to hear something like: "We will make clinical trials unnecessary for 80% of drug candidates because our virtual human simulation will predict human outcomes with higher fidelity than Phase I trials." That would be a definite vision worth investing in. I do not see it.

The strongest bull case is this: if Cell2Sentence turns out to be the correct paradigm for biological simulation -- the way the transformer architecture proved correct for natural language -- then CellType has established the founding methodology and the deepest expertise. The Google DeepMind collaboration, rather than being a dependency, could signal that Google's own AI researchers concluded this approach is genuinely superior and chose van Dijk as the world's best partner. The 4,000 drugs screened with a validated novel cancer treatment signal suggests the technology produces real biological insights, not just computational artifacts. And if van Dijk builds the agentic orchestration layer into something no competitor can replicate -- the proprietary drug discovery pipeline that sits on top of the open-source foundation -- the company could become the Palantir of pharmaceutical R&D: a platform so deeply integrated into pharma workflows that switching costs make competition irrelevant. For this to work, CellType would need to move extremely fast from open-source academic credibility to proprietary commercial moat, locking in pharma partnerships with validated results before Isomorphic Labs or any well-funded competitor builds on their published methodology. It is possible. But it requires a race against the very organizations CellType has armed with its core technology.

I respect van Dijk's credentials and the genuine novelty of Cell2Sentence. But I invest in monopolies, and I do not see how CellType builds one. The core technology is public. The market is saturated with well-funded competitors. The Google relationship is structurally ambiguous. And the articulated vision, while technically sophisticated, does not describe a specific future that only CellType can create. This is a company built around a genuine scientific contribution deployed into a competitive market without a clear path to dominance. The contribution is real; the monopoly is not.
