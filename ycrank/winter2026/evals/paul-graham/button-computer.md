# Button Computer -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that jumps out here isn't the product. It's the graveyard surrounding it. Humane raised $240 million and died. Limitless raised at a $350M valuation and got absorbed by Meta. Rabbit R1 raised $30M and faded. And now two engineers want to enter this exact category with a two-person team and YC-scale funding. Normally when I see a startup entering a space where well-funded predecessors have failed, I ask: what do these founders understand that the $240M company didn't? The answer here seems to be "make it simpler and cheaper." That's a real insight. But it's not the same as understanding something deep about the problem that others missed. Simplification is a design philosophy, not a moat.

The origin of this idea concerns me most. I don't see the organic backstory. There's no moment where Chris or Ryan personally hit a wall — where they were doing something with their hands and desperately needed AI and thought "I have to build this." The problem statement reads like a product brief: "pulling out a phone creates friction for AI access." That's true, but it's the kind of observation anyone with a phone could make. It's not something that grew from the founders' own lives the way Dropbox grew from Houston forgetting his USB drive. When I look at their backgrounds — Apple Vision Pro, AR/VR, spatial computing — the natural continuation would be something in AR or spatial interfaces, not a clip-on button. The path from Vision Pro engineer to Bluetooth AI button doesn't trace a line through personal necessity. It traces a line through market observation. And the schlep here is thin. Voice capture to LLM API to text-to-speech is a pipeline anyone can assemble. The dossier itself notes "Bluetooth-connected microphone/speaker hardware is commodity." When the technical core of your product is commodity, you need extraordinary distribution or extraordinary insight to win. I don't see evidence of either yet.

The founder attention question is a genuine red flag. Chris Nolet founded Vibe Code Go in YC S25 — a mobile vibe-coding app — and now Button Computer in W26. That's two entirely different products in consecutive batches, which is roughly six months apart. I don't know what happened to Vibe Code Go, and maybe it was a deliberate pivot to something better. But the pattern worries me because the best founders I've funded are people who are obsessed with one problem, not people who cycle through ideas across batches. Earnest founders work on something because they can't stop thinking about it. Switching from a coding app to an AI wearable button in six months doesn't suggest that kind of obsession.

Let me make the bull case, because it exists. These are two Apple hardware engineers who watched the Vision Pro ship. They understand the full stack — hardware design, firmware, Bluetooth protocols, audio processing, software integration. That's rare and directly relevant. The argument is that Humane failed because it tried to replace the phone with a $499 device that had a projector, a camera, cellular connectivity, and a subscription. Button strips all that away. At $79 pre-order, it's an impulse buy. The "just a button" simplicity could be what makes this work where Humane's complexity killed it. If they can get the hardware right, ship on time, and ride the wave of AI becoming genuinely useful for quick voice queries, the low price and dead-simple interaction model could achieve the kind of viral spread that more ambitious devices couldn't. And the competitive graveyard actually helps: Humane's death and Limitless's acquisition cleared two funded competitors while generating press that validates the category. If I'm wrong about Button, it'll be because radical simplification at a low price point was the insight this category needed, and two ex-Apple hardware engineers were exactly the right people to execute it.

But I don't think I'm wrong. The fundamental problem is that the technology stack — microphone, Bluetooth, API call, speaker — has no defensibility. Omi already exists at $89, is open-source, and has Tim Draper's money. Friend exists at $99. Apple is reportedly building its own AI wearable. OpenAI is working with Jony Ive on hardware. When Apple can ship an AirPods firmware update that does exactly what Button does, the standalone device category collapses. This isn't like Stripe, where the schlep of dealing with banks and fraud and money transmission licenses created years of defensible complexity. There's no regulatory barrier, no data network effect, no switching cost. The only defense is execution speed against companies with orders of magnitude more resources, and that's not a bet I want to make with my own money.

The founders are technically credible — I'm not questioning their ability to build. Chris's GitHub work and Apple tenure, Ryan's Reality Composer experience — these are real engineers. But technical ability in a commodity category without organic problem discovery is exactly the pattern I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas." Smart engineers picking a trending category and building something competent in it. The market is large. The technology works. But when the schlep is absent and the origin isn't organic, what you get is a company that might ship a product but won't survive the moment a platform player decides to care.
