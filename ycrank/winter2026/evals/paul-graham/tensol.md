# Tensol -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Tensol is that "AI employees for your business" is the single most consensus idea in startups right now. Lindy has $49.9M. 11x has $74M. Artisan has $25M and $5M ARR. Relevance AI has $37M. Salesforce and Microsoft are building the same thing into their platforms. When I see a two-person team entering a space where competitors have collectively raised $185M+, I don't think "market validation." I think about what I wrote in 2025: the most impressive companies I'd seen were not working on AI. The problem with consensus ideas is that the upside has already been priced in by the market. The question is never "is this a big market?" -- it's "why will these specific founders win?"

So how did they find this problem? Oliviero built integration workflows at Stacksync, a YC W24 company, and says the product he built there is now used by Fortune 500s. That gives him a genuine connection to the pain of connecting SaaS tools -- he's seen it from the infrastructure side. Pratik won $50K at CMU's venture competition with Solstis, described as "AI-powered workflow automations." There's a thread here: both founders have been circling the integration-and-automation problem. But then OpenClaw exploded to 180K GitHub stars in late 2025, and Solstis became Tensol -- a pivot from their own workflow automation approach to wrapping someone else's open-source agent framework. That pivot pattern worries me. When a company abandons its own technology to build on the hot new framework everyone else can also build on, the organic connection between founder and problem starts to fray. This feels less like a team that can't stop working on their problem and more like a team repositioning around whatever technology has the most momentum.

The deeper issue is the absence of schlep. The Stripe pattern works because the Collisons built their own payment infrastructure -- the banks, the fraud systems, the compliance layer. That proprietary schlep was the moat. Tensol's core runtime is OpenClaw, which is open-source and available to every competitor. The integration layer -- OAuth connectors to Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and 40 other tools -- is commodity plumbing that any team can replicate. Where is the ugly, tedious work that only these founders are willing to do? Enterprise trust in autonomous agents could be that schlep -- getting companies to let AI write to their production CRM and create Jira tickets requires painstaking reliability engineering and compliance work. But I see no evidence they've started that grind. The website lists "progressive autonomy" and enterprise security features, but there are no case studies, no customer testimonials, no named companies trusting Tensol with write access to their systems.

The bull case is real and I want to take it seriously. Oliviero is genuinely technical -- CS background, built products at Stacksync, has a real GitHub history. Pratik has an AI/ML master's from CMU and hands-on engineering experience at Rivian. Together they cover the two competencies you'd want: SaaS integration architecture and AI agent development. If the category shakes out the way cloud infrastructure did -- where open-source foundations (Linux, Kubernetes) became the standard and the winners were companies that built the best managed layers on top -- then being early to OpenClaw with deep integration expertise could work. The "pre-configured role-based agents" angle (deploying an engineering agent or sales agent in minutes rather than building custom workflows) is a reasonable product bet against Lindy's build-it-yourself approach. And the timing of OpenClaw's independent foundation transition means they might be building on something that becomes genuinely neutral infrastructure. If they can get two or three mid-market companies deeply dependent on their agents -- the kind of dependency where the accumulated context creates real switching costs -- they'd have something.

But that bull case requires several things to go right simultaneously. OpenClaw needs to remain viable and neutral after its creator joined OpenAI. Tensol needs to build proprietary value on top of a framework anyone can use. They need to win enterprise trust for autonomous agents in a market where well-funded competitors are spending heavily on sales and reliability. And they need to do all of this with two people and standard YC funding against teams with 50-100x their capital. Each of these is possible individually. Requiring all of them starts to look like multiple miracles, which is one of my red flags. When I look at this team, I see competent, energetic young founders who've accomplished real things -- venture competition wins, hackathon wins, prior YC experience. What I don't see is the kind of founder-problem bond that makes a company survive the years of painful execution ahead. The problem wasn't discovered through lived necessity; the technology was adopted because it's what's trending. That's usually not enough.
