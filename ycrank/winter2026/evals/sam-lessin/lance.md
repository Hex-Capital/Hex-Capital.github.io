# Lance -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my fundamental problem with Lance: if AI didn't exist, this company doesn't exist. That's the single most important thing I can say about it. My "cherry on top" test is dead simple -- would this business be good without AI? Lance's answer is an unambiguous no. There is no hotel operations company underneath the AI layer. There are no painting crews, no parking infrastructure, no physical assets. The AI IS the product. And that puts Lance squarely in the category I've been loudest about avoiding: a software company whose moat is about to learn it isn't a moat anymore.

The founders are credible -- I'll give them that. Caleb Chan built voice and AI agent technology at Google and Salesforce and was a founding engineer at a company that achieved a nine-figure exit. Gatik Trivedi has Stanford speech and language research credentials and prior YC experience at Knowtex. These are competent people. But competent people pursuing a consensus idea is actually my worst-case scenario. "AI agents for hotel front desks" is not an idea that provokes genuine skepticism from investors -- it's the kind of thing that makes every VC nod approvingly. Chronic staffing shortages? Check. Repetitive tasks ripe for automation? Check. Obvious ROI story? Check. When I describe the "sane person, insane idea" framework, I mean something like Teamshares buying hundreds of small businesses through employee ownership -- an idea that makes smart people uncomfortable. "AI handles your hotel phone calls" makes nobody uncomfortable. It's table stakes in 2026.

The competitive dynamics here are what worry me most. Canary Technologies has $180 million in funding, a $600 million valuation, and already launched AI Voice as a module within a broader platform that includes contactless check-in, digital tipping, and guest messaging. Duve raised $85 million. These aren't sleeping incumbents -- they're well-capitalized platforms with existing hotel relationships that can bundle AI voice at zero marginal cost. Lance's "Computer Use Agent" approach -- where the AI navigates hotel software UIs directly rather than through API integrations -- is technically interesting, but it's built on top of capabilities that Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are all commoditizing. When computer use becomes a standard feature of every foundation model, which it will within eighteen months, Lance's core technical differentiator dissolves. Worse, the UI fragility problem is real: every time Oracle OPERA or Cloudbeds pushes a UI update, Lance's agents could break across dozens of properties simultaneously.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. Fifty-plus hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt properties at pre-seed is legitimately impressive traction -- most YC companies at this stage are still doing design partnerships. The testimonials about reducing front desk call volume by thirty percent and recovering revenue from restaurant bookings suggest real value delivery. If Lance can accumulate enough property-specific operational data across diverse hotel configurations, there's a version of this where switching costs compound meaningfully. And the Quore partnership is a smart distribution play. If I squint, I can see an argument that the hospitality vertical is specialized enough that general-purpose AI voice platforms won't invest in building the domain-specific workflow depth required -- that the gap between "AI can answer phones" and "AI can navigate a specific PMS to schedule a wake-up call, route a towel delivery request, and process a restaurant booking while maintaining brand compliance standards" is wider than it appears. If that gap stays wide, Lance could build a genuinely defensible vertical position.

But I don't believe it stays wide. The structural logic cuts against them. Lance is tagged "SaaS, Conversational AI" -- literally the two categories I've spent the last two years arguing are being destroyed. The business model is almost certainly per-hotel-per-month software subscriptions, which is exactly what I mean when I say software is a business tool, not a business model. There's no protocol being created here, no new primitive that other businesses build on. Lance is an application sitting on top of someone else's infrastructure -- hotel PMS systems, Quore's operations platform, Anthropic's computer use capabilities. Every layer underneath them is controlled by someone else, and the layers above them (the actual hotel operations, the physical property, the guest relationships) belong to the customer. That leaves Lance in the thinnest possible position: a software intermediary in a world where software intermediaries are being compressed from both directions. I'd rather fund the hotel group itself than fund a software layer that any well-resourced competitor can replicate once the underlying AI capabilities fully commoditize.
