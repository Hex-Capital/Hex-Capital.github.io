# Stilta -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I see when I look at Stilta is the competitive landscape, and what it tells me about timing. Solve Intelligence has $55 million in funding and eight-figure ARR. DeepIP reached seven-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics grew ARR 20x in six months. These are not legacy incumbents asleep at the wheel -- these are fast-moving startups that have already demonstrated product-market fit in AI patent tooling. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router -- that dismissal was the signal. Here, the market has already been validated and the race is well underway. Stilta is arriving with four people and $500K to a party where the drinks are half gone. That's not skating to where the puck will be. That's arriving at a rink where several well-capitalized teams are already playing.

But the more fundamental issue is consequence magnitude. If Stilta succeeds completely -- becomes the dominant AI workspace for patent attorneys worldwide -- what changes? Patent filings happen faster. Lawyers bill fewer hours per patent. IP departments consolidate their tool stack. That's a fine business. It might be a billion-dollar outcome. But I keep coming back to my core question: does the world operate differently? The answer is no. The patent system continues in its current form. No trillion-dollar industry is disrupted. No physical reality is transformed. A 60% reduction in manual patent review work is an efficiency gain, not a structural displacement. "Cursor for patent attorneys" is an honest framing -- Cursor makes developers more productive within the existing paradigm of software development. It doesn't eliminate developers or reinvent what software is. That's the ceiling Stilta has implicitly set for itself.

The team composition reinforces my concern. Four McKinsey and QuantumBlack alumni building enterprise workflow software. These are people trained to identify manageable market segments and optimize within existing systems -- that is literally what McKinsey consultants do for a living. I look for outsiders who don't know what the industry considers impossible, which frees them to attempt it. A team of management consultants building productivity tools for a professional services niche is the opposite of that pattern. They've brought establishment credibility to an establishment problem. Oskar Block's bootstrapped sports betting startups to $1M ARR demonstrate execution ability, which I respect -- but execution on a small ambition is still a small ambition. And critically, not one of the four founders has patent law experience. For a product that must meet legal-grade accuracy thresholds where a single missed prior art reference could lead to malpractice exposure, that absence is not an outsider advantage -- it's a domain gap that the competitive landscape won't wait for them to fill.

The strongest bull case would require me to believe that the end-to-end workspace approach is structurally superior to the point solutions that are already scaling -- that Stilta's breadth becomes a moat as firms consolidate tools. There's a version of this story where Stilta becomes the Salesforce of IP workflow: the integrated platform that displaces a fragmented stack of specialized tools. If I believed patent law firms would pay a significant premium for consolidation, and that a four-person team could build end-to-end depth competitive with focused teams that are 12-18 months ahead with 50-100x more capital, this could work. The underlying LLM timing is genuinely favorable -- agentic AI capabilities crossed the threshold for reliable legal document analysis in 2024-2025, and patent filing volumes continue to grow faster than attorney supply. But even in the best case, I'm looking at a workflow automation company in a $3-13 billion addressable market with multiple well-funded competitors. The magnitude of success isn't large enough to justify the magnitude of risk.

I'll say what I always say to teams like this: you're smart enough to work on something bigger. Four people with this caliber of AI engineering talent and enterprise credibility could attack a problem where the consequence of success is civilization-scale. Instead, you've chosen a problem where the consequence of success is that patent lawyers save time. The market is real, the timing is reasonable, the team can execute -- and you've reduced the probability of failure to the point where success doesn't much matter.
