# Condor Energy -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The dossier itself contains a sentence that would end my evaluation before it begins: "The individual components — energy dashboards, price forecasting, hedging analytics — are not technically unique." When a company's own description concedes that nothing in the product is novel, you are looking at a 1-to-n business. Condor is assembling existing capabilities — consumption monitoring, market data aggregation, hedging analytics, capex screening — into a unified dashboard for energy buyers. This is integration, not invention. A better spreadsheet for energy procurement is not a secret about how the world works; it is an observation about workflow inefficiency that any competent software team could act on. And many already have.

What is the secret here? The implicit thesis is something like: "Large electricity buyers are systematically overpaying because their tools are fragmented, and an integrated platform can capture 20% of that waste." But who disagrees with this? No energy professional would argue that fragmented spreadsheets are superior to integrated software. No CFO would claim that better price forecasting is unwelcome. The thesis is consensus dressed as insight. When I look at the competitive landscape — Voltus on the demand response side, Pexapark on the seller side, Granular Energy on certificates, Gridmatic on retail supply, plus SAP and Schneider Electric lurking with existing energy management modules — I see a market where multiple players are converging on the same observation from different angles. This is the early stage of a mimetic competition cycle: everyone has noticed the same inefficiency, everyone is building dashboards, and no one has a structural path to monopoly. The inevitable outcome is margin compression.

The founders have relevant domain credentials — a power trader, two engineers with hydropower experience, all from serious French institutions. But relevant credentials and a genuine secret are different things entirely. The "200+ company interviews" that informed the product signal exactly the lean-startup methodology I find most concerning. When founders tell me they validated through customer discovery, I hear that they started without a definite thesis and constructed one from survey data. Zuckerberg did not interview 200 college students before building Facebook; he had a specific insight about real-identity networks and built it. Musk did not survey rocket scientists before designing reusable boosters; he did the physics and concluded everyone else was wrong. The interview-driven approach produces products that address expressed needs rather than latent truths — and expressed needs are by definition consensus, which means competitive markets and no monopoly.

The strongest bull case for Condor is the data center explosion. The AI infrastructure buildout is creating an entirely new class of massive electricity buyers — companies spending tens of millions annually on power who did not exist five years ago and have no legacy procurement relationships. If Condor could become the default energy management platform for hyperscalers and GPU-farm operators, the timing is genuinely favorable. The misaligned incentive structure of traditional energy brokers — who earn commissions per MWh and therefore benefit from higher consumption — creates a real opening for a subscription-aligned platform that optimizes total cost. And Florian Pérocheau's power trading background gives the team more credibility than a typical SaaS team entering energy. If Condor could monopolize the data center energy procurement workflow specifically, accumulate proprietary load profiles and hedging outcomes across dozens of facilities, and use that data asset to produce forecasts that no competitor could replicate, there would be a path to defensibility. But "could" is doing enormous work in that sentence. The dossier shows no evidence that this data flywheel is spinning, no evidence that the product is 10x better than hiring a competent energy consultant, and no evidence that the founders have a definite plan for how initial customers compound into an unassailable position. They are already splitting focus between France and the US with three people — the opposite of the concentrated, niche-monopolizing strategy that defines my most successful investments.

The technology here is table stakes. AI-powered forecasting in energy markets is what every energy tech startup claims in 2026. The platform aggregates known data sources — consumption meters, PPA contracts, wholesale feeds — into dashboards with analytics. This is competent software engineering, not a technological discontinuity. Nothing in the product makes a previously impossible thing possible. A well-resourced competitor — or one of the incumbents like Schneider Electric — could replicate this integration within eighteen months. There is no 10x moment, no structural break with the past, no capability that did not exist before Condor built it. This is the energy equivalent of building a marginally better CRM: useful to customers, impossible to monopolize.

I pass. Condor Energy is a competent team building a reasonable product in a market that is becoming crowded precisely because the opportunity is obvious. There is no secret. There is no monopoly path. The technology is incremental. The go-to-market is dispersed rather than concentrated. The founders show domain expertise but not the kind of definite, civilization-level conviction that separates transformative companies from competent ones. This is an energy consulting business delivered as software — and while it may build a viable company, it will not return a fund.
