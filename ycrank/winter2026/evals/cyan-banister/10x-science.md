# 10x Science -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about 10x Science: this is an extraordinarily credentialed team building in one of the most competitive, most consensus investment categories of this moment. AI applied to biotech — every fund I know has a deck like this in their pipeline right now. And that's the thing that gives me pause before anything else. I've learned over two decades of writing checks that the best investments look bad to most investors at the time. SpaceX was lunacy. Crusoe was absurd. Even Uber was illegal. When I look at 10x Science, I see a company that looks *good* to most investors — deep Stanford pedigree, Nobel Prize-winning lab connection, clean enterprise SaaS model, well-defined market. That legibility is precisely what makes me less excited, not more. The contrarian edge I hunt for isn't here in the way I need it to be.

If I could sit down with David Roberts and Andrew Reiter, my first question wouldn't be about peptide mapping or mass spectrometry throughput. I'd ask them to tell me how they got here — not the professional timeline, but the real story. What I can see from the dossier is impressive credentials: a Ph.D. from Wisconsin, a postdoc in Carolyn Bertozzi's lab, fifty-plus publications, a Damon Runyon Fellowship. Reiter trained at the Broad Institute's Proteomics Platform and is an NSF fellow at Stanford. These are world-class scientific accomplishments. But credentials and biographical grit are different things. I'm looking for the specific hardship that forged an unbreakable commitment to this particular problem — the reason this founder will keep going when the company hits a wall, when pharma sales cycles drag to eighteen months, when Dotmatics with their 200-plus biopharma customers starts adding AI features to Byonic. I can't see that thread from what's available. It doesn't mean it isn't there — some of the most resilient people I've met come from academic science, where rejection and failure are constant — but my primary evaluation channel is blocked without the founder's personal narrative.

Now let me make the strongest bull case, because the technical foundation here genuinely impresses me. Two of three founders trained in the exact lab that won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry they're building tools around. That's not just founder-market fit — that's founder-market fusion. The timing argument has real teeth: AI-designed protein therapeutics from tools like AlphaFold and RFdiffusion are flooding the early pipeline with drug candidates, and the characterization bottleneck downstream is real and growing. This reminds me of the pattern I've invested through before — infrastructure at a technological inflection point. When I backed companies at inflection points, the key was that someone saw the demand curve before others did. If characterization volume is about to explode tenfold and legacy tools from Thermo Fisher and Waters are instrument-locked and architecturally unable to scale, then 10x Science is positioned at exactly the right chokepoint. The CTO Vishnu's experience scaling Nooks through a forty-three-million-dollar Series B means this isn't three academics who've never shipped product. That combination — deep domain science plus someone who's actually built and scaled software — is legitimately rare. If this team executes, the regulatory validation moat they'd build over time could be formidable.

The regulatory complexity dimension is where this company most aligns with how I think. Biopharma characterization for regulatory submissions requires GxP-validated workflows. That's a hard, slow, expensive barrier to entry — exactly the kind of moat I've watched develop at companies like Contraline navigating FDA pathways. Once 10x Science gets referenced in a customer's IND or BLA filing, switching costs become enormous. And the structural conflict with instrument vendors is interesting: Thermo Fisher and Waters are incentivized to keep their software bundled with their hardware, which means they'll resist building a truly instrument-agnostic solution. That's a crack in the market that a purpose-built startup can wedge into. I've seen this pattern before in security — incumbents protecting their bundled offerings while a focused newcomer builds the better standalone tool.

But I keep coming back to what's missing through my particular lens. This company doesn't create economic access for underserved populations in any direct way. It makes biopharma analytical teams more efficient — these are some of the best-funded organizations on the planet. The downstream benefit to patients is real but diffuse and distant, several years and several clinical trial stages removed. I'm drawn to companies where the impact is immediate and tangible — where a driver earns income tomorrow, where a homeowner sees a transparent price today. I also notice the brand confusion with 10x Genomics, a publicly traded company in an adjacent space, which is the kind of unforced commercial error that makes me wonder about go-to-market instincts. And the unverifiable "2x YC Founder" claim on the company page nags at me — I care deeply about authenticity, and credential stretching, however minor, is the kind of thing I'd want to probe directly.

This is a company I'd want to have coffee with the founders about, specifically to hear the stories behind the resumes. The scientific moat and timing are real. But through my framework — where I'm looking for outsider founders solving problems born from personal adversity, building something the consensus considers strange or impossible — 10x Science reads as elite insiders building something the market already wants. That's a perfectly good company. It's just not my kind of bet.
