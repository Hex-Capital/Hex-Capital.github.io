# Visibl Semiconductors -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing about "AI agents for chip design" in February 2026: it's not an insane idea. It's a consensus idea. ChipAgents has already raised $74 million and deployed at 80 semiconductor companies with 140x year-over-year ARR growth. Cognichip pulled in $33 million from Lux and Mayfield. Cadence launched ChipStack AI Agent literally this month. Synopsys.ai has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. NVIDIA put $2 billion into Synopsys to accelerate AI across EDA workloads. When I look at this landscape and then see a 2-person pre-seed team entering the exact same thesis, my framework produces a clear answer: the non-consensus premium has been fully arbitraged. You're buying narrative at market price -- or worse, you're buying it late.

The CTO, Jordon Kashanchi, is genuinely credible. BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from UT Austin with an integrated circuits specialization, silicon design at Microsoft on Azure Maia custom AI silicon, prior stints at ARM and Intel, published in PNAS and ACM. That's a real semiconductor engineer who's lived inside the pain of EDA tool complexity. I take that seriously. But one credible CTO doesn't make a sane-person-insane-idea combination when the idea itself has become the hottest category in semiconductor tooling. Kashanchi is a sane person with a sane idea -- which in my framework means the returns are already being competed away before the first customer signs. The CEO, Bryce Neil, built software at Deloitte's OmniaAI team, which is fine for the AI platform layer but creates a domain credibility gap when you're selling to chip design leads at Intel or Broadcom who want to talk about timing closure and verification coverage. Co-founder relationship origin is unclear from the dossier -- no shared employer, no shared university -- which is a minor concern but not disqualifying.

The structural moat question is where this falls apart for me. Strip away the AI and ask: would this business exist? No. The AI IS the business. That's the exact opposite of my "cherry on top" test. Craftwork would still be a painting company without AI -- a less efficient one, but a real business with crews and customers and revenue. Visibl without AI is... nothing. It's an empty IDE. And when the AI capability is the entire value proposition, my question becomes: who wins the AI-for-EDA race? The answer is almost certainly the incumbents with distribution. Synopsys and Cadence have decades of customer relationships, existing integration points into every chip design workflow, and the financial firepower to build or acquire any AI capability a startup develops. Their business model tension -- AI potentially cannibalizing license revenue -- is real, but it's the kind of tension that slows incumbents by 18 months, not the kind that lets a 2-person startup build an insurmountable lead. And even among startups, ChipAgents has a massive head start with 80 production deployments generating the proprietary design-iteration data that would constitute Visibl's eventual moat.

The bull case deserves a real hearing. If you believe that "AI-native" architecture is to EDA what web-native was to design tools -- that building from scratch around an agent-first paradigm produces a categorically better product than bolting AI features onto legacy tool suites -- then Visibl's standalone IDE approach could be structurally superior to both ChipAgents (which integrates into Synopsys and Cadence workflows) and the incumbents' own AI layers. The on-prem deployment model is smart for an IP-sensitive industry, and once embedded in a design team's workflow, switching costs compound. If Kashanchi's firsthand experience on Azure Maia translates into product decisions that resonate with other custom silicon teams, and if those early deployments generate proprietary context data that makes the platform meaningfully better, there's a path where Visibl becomes the "new paradigm" player while everyone else is adding AI paint to legacy architecture. But that path requires outrunning ChipAgents' 80-customer head start and $74 million war chest with a fraction of the resources, in an enterprise sales environment where procurement cycles stretch for months and trust is built over years. That's not an impossible path -- it's just one where the timing and competitive dynamics work against you.

This company occupies the exact category I've spent the last two years publicly arguing against: an AI-first startup in a consensus market where incumbents have overwhelming distribution advantages. It's not creating a new primitive or protocol -- it's an application-layer tool that lives on top of existing chip design workflows. There are no network effects; each on-prem deployment is isolated. The narrative can stretch ("AI agents for all hardware engineering") but it's competing against four or five funded startups telling similar stories with more traction. And there's zero revenue or customer signal to provide a downside cushion. I'd rather fund the company that makes chip design teams 15% more productive through better project management and physical workflow coordination than the one betting everything on having better AI agents than Synopsys, Cadence, ChipAgents, and Cognichip simultaneously.
