# Remy AI -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I look for is how the founders found this problem. Oscar Brisset spent eighteen months at BCG X advising Fortune 500 logistics companies. That's where the insight came from — eighty percent of warehouses have no automation, and existing solutions are too expensive for most facilities. This is a real observation. But it's a consultant's observation, not a warehouse operator's pain. Nobody at Remy AI was running a 3PL and tearing their hair out over the cost of automation. Nobody was working a warehouse floor thinking "if I could just automate this one step." The idea was identified through market analysis, not discovered through lived experience. When I compare that to how Stripe started — the Collisons were programmers who personally hated integrating payment APIs — the organic connection just isn't here.

This matters more than usual because warehouse robotics is among the hardest schleps in all of technology. You're building physical machines that must work reliably in messy, variable environments — different products, different layouts, different processes at every facility. The incumbents — Dexterity, Nimble, Covariant, RightHand Robotics — have collectively raised over $970 million and none of them have cracked this at scale. Entering this arena as two people with $500K requires either a genuinely novel structural insight or an extraordinary tolerance for pain. The structural insight Remy claims is brownfield deployment at fifty percent lower cost — Christensen's low-end disruption, targeting the eighty percent of warehouses that incumbents can't economically serve. That's a real strategic idea. But it was born in a slide deck, not in a warehouse.

The strongest part of the story is the technical foundation. Ben Kaye has genuine research depth — an Oxford DPhil in the Visual Geometry Group, a CVPR 2025 publication on 3D shape reconstruction, active GitHub repos with real research code. He's a builder, not a resume padder. That matters. But 3D vision research and building reliable warehouse robots that handle thousands of different products are adjacent domains, not the same one. And the core technology bet — Vision-Language-Action models — is exactly the kind of fast-moving open research area where being two people is a disadvantage. Stanford published OpenVLA. Google DeepMind shipped Gemini Robotics. Physical Intelligence raised massive rounds for π0. Remy's claimed edge is a data-efficient training pipeline, but that claim is unvalidated, and even if true today, the half-life of a training trick in a field this active is measured in months.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. The brownfield 3PL market really is structurally underserved, and for real reasons — incumbents' unit economics and sales motions are built for large facilities, and moving downmarket would cannibalize their margins and retrain their sales teams. If VLA models crossed a capability threshold in 2024-2025, there may be a window where a lean team could build a good-enough robot at a price point that opens an entirely new market segment. Oscar's consulting background at least exposed him to logistics companies' actual buying patterns, even if that exposure was analytical rather than operational. And the co-founders share an Oxford connection that predates the company, which avoids my red flag about strangers teaming up to start something. If they could get one robot reliably picking in one warehouse, the seventy thousand US-based 3PLs are a huge market that nobody is specifically targeting at this price point.

But this company needs multiple miracles to work. They need VLA models that generalize across diverse products without retraining. They need hardware manufacturing at lower cost than competitors with a hundred-fold funding advantage. They need enterprise sales into a fragmented market of small operators. They need field service for physical machines in demanding environments. When a startup needs that many things to go right simultaneously, I want to see either extreme founder-problem fit — founders who understand something about this problem that nobody else does because they've lived inside it — or evidence of the kind of relentless resourcefulness that suggests they'll adapt when the plan doesn't survive contact with reality. I see neither signal here. There is zero public evidence of traction: no pilots, no LOIs, no named customers, no partnerships. At pre-seed that's not damning by itself, but combined with a consulting-derived idea in the most capital-intensive category imaginable, it leaves me without the conviction I'd need to write a check from my own account.
