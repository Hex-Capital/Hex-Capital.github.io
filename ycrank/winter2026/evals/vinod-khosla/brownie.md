# IncidentFox -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

IncidentFox walks into a room where five well-funded players are already seated. Resolve AI has $160 million and a billion-dollar valuation. Incident.io has $96 million and $9 million in revenue. Datadog is shipping Bits AI. PagerDuty is shipping SRE Agents. Microsoft is building this into Azure. And IncidentFox's plan is to win with an open-source Apache 2.0 project, 305 GitHub stars, and two engineers from Roblox. This is not contrarian. This is not skating to where the puck will be. The puck is here, and every major player in observability infrastructure is already fighting over it. When I backed Juniper against Cisco, Cisco's CTO told me they would *never* build a TCP/IP router -- the incumbents dismissed the approach. Here, the incumbents are building exactly what IncidentFox is building, with hundred-million-dollar head starts.

Let me start where I always start: if IncidentFox succeeds completely, what changes? On-call engineers triage incidents faster. SRE teams resolve production outages more efficiently. Response times drop. That is a real pain point -- anyone who has been paged at 3 AM knows it. But the consequence of success is a better workflow tool, not a transformed industry. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. The infrastructure stack doesn't get replaced. Animal agriculture doesn't get dismantled. Energy production doesn't shift. Incident response gets 50-80% more efficient. That is the definition of reducing the probability of failure to the point where the consequences of success are, to me, insufficient to justify the competitive gauntlet this team would have to run. The AIOps market is $11 billion -- not trivial -- but capturing meaningful share against five funded competitors and three platform incumbents is a different proposition than creating a new category.

The founders concern me in a specific way. Both Jimmy Wei and Long Yi come from Roblox infrastructure. Long Yi "experienced the chaos of on-call firsthand." This is the most conventional founder-market fit story in enterprise software: engineers who experienced a pain point building a tool to fix it. I have consistently found that industry insiders who know exactly what the current system's problems are tend to build solutions calibrated to those known problems -- 5% year-to-year improvement, not a wholesale reinvention. Where is the outsider perspective? Where is the biochemistry professor who doesn't know what the food industry considers impossible? These founders know exactly what SRE teams consider possible, and they're building within those boundaries. The "brownie" URL slug on the YC page hints at a pivot, which could signal learning rate and adaptability, but without knowing what they pivoted from or what they learned, I can't give credit for it.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: open-source wins distribution the way Linux won servers, the per-customer learning flywheel (codebase analysis, incident history, team patterns) creates a compounding data moat that proprietary competitors cannot replicate, and the auto-discovery of integrations is a genuine UX breakthrough that collapses the months-long setup time competitors require. At $1 million, this is a cheap option on capturing meaningful share of a large and growing market. If LLM capabilities continue their exponential improvement, the quality gap between IncidentFox and Resolve AI could narrow faster than the funding gap would suggest. I take this seriously. But the bull case requires IncidentFox to win an open-source adoption race it hasn't started winning -- 305 stars and two Show HN posts with 3 and 1 points respectively do not suggest developer community momentum. And the core technology -- LLMs querying logs and metrics through integrations -- uses publicly available models and techniques. The moat is execution speed and integration breadth, not a proprietary technology breakthrough that makes the incumbent approach uneconomic.

The technology itself is competent engineering, not structural disruption. Multi-agent orchestration, RAPTOR retrieval, Prophet anomaly detection, 300+ integrations -- these are building blocks assembled well, not a 10x cost reduction or a capability that didn't exist before. IncidentFox doesn't replace Datadog or PagerDuty; it sits on top of them. That architectural dependency means the incumbents can absorb this functionality into their platforms at any time -- and they are already doing so. When I invested in Square, the technology made traditional POS infrastructure structurally obsolete. Nothing about IncidentFox makes the existing observability stack obsolete. It adds a layer.

I pass. These founders are too capable to spend their careers making incident response incrementally better in a market where five companies with 100x their capital are building the same thing. The problem they've identified is real but the ambition is calibrated to the scale of the workflow, not the scale of the opportunity. Go find a problem where the experts tell you it cannot be done.
