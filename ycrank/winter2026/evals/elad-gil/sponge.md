# Sponge -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Sponge is the competitive landscape, and it tells me everything about the market structure. When Visa announces "Intelligent Commerce," Mastercard ships "Agent Pay," Stripe launches an Agentic Commerce Suite, Coinbase has AgentKit with 50 million transactions on the x402 protocol, a16z backs Catena Labs at $18M, and four other funded startups are pursuing variations of the same thesis -- this is not a non-obvious market. This is a consensus bet. The TAM slides project $199 billion by 2034 at a 43.8% CAGR, which is exactly the kind of forward-looking market sizing that I find misleading. Nobody in this space -- not Catena, not Skyfire, not Natural, not Sponge -- has reported revenue. The category has attracted significant capital and corporate attention before demonstrating that agents are actually making autonomous payments at any meaningful volume today. When the market looks this obvious, the asymmetric returns I hunt for aren't there.

The structural moment is real but fully priced in. Agent capability has crossed meaningful thresholds in the last 18 months -- Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and the proliferation of agent frameworks create genuine demand for financial primitives. But recognizing a structural inflection is only half the equation. The other half is whether YOU are uniquely positioned to capture it before others see it. Stripe built their business by identifying a developer-centric wedge in online payments when everyone else assumed PayPal had won. The wedge was non-obvious. For Sponge, the wedge -- "give agents wallets and let businesses sell to them" -- is the obvious play that every competitor is executing simultaneously. Worse, Sponge's former employer built the exact infrastructure layer that Sponge is rebuilding. Stripe didn't face a "Stripe" when it started.

I should address the bull case directly, because the founding team's credentials are genuinely strong. Three engineers who built Stripe's stablecoin financial accounts, stablecoin payments, and core money movement systems -- that's not a team that needs to learn how payments infrastructure works. They've shipped a live product with a TypeScript SDK, MCP integration into agent frameworks, and multi-chain support across fiat and crypto rails. The two-product architecture -- Wallet for agents, Gateway for businesses -- shows real distribution thinking at the pre-seed stage. The Gateway product, where a business uploads its API spec and agents can onboard autonomously, is a smart wedge because it reduces the business-side friction that other crypto-only competitors don't address. If agent transaction volume inflects rapidly over the next 12-18 months, Sponge's fiat-plus-crypto hybrid and developer-framework integration could make it the default payment layer for the long tail of agent builders, while Stripe services enterprise merchants. That's the Sponge-wins scenario, and it's not crazy. The structural gap between Stripe's enterprise focus (URBN, Etsy, Ashley Furniture as launch partners) and Sponge's developer-first approach could be durable.

But I don't invest on "could be" when the market structure is working against the company. The single-miracle test reveals the problem: Sponge needs at least two things to go right. First, agent adoption has to reach a volume where autonomous payments are frequent enough to build a business on. This is an exogenous dependency -- Sponge can't control it. When Harvey depended on model fidelity improving, I could track the GPT scaling curve and predict with confidence that the threshold would be crossed in 12-18 months. There is no equivalent trackable curve for "when will agents start making autonomous purchases at scale." Second, even if the volume appears, Sponge has to win developer adoption against better-funded competitors and incumbents who are already building the same integrations. That's two miracles, and they compound.

The technology cycle positioning compounds my concern. This feels structurally similar to the VR/AR moment of 2015 -- the capability exists in demos and controlled environments, but the behavioral adoption curve for enterprises actually trusting agents with financial autonomy may be further out than the ecosystem assumes. When every major payment company ships an agent product in the same quarter but none reports transaction volume, the market is signaling category creation, not category validation. I'd rather invest in this space when there's evidence of real transaction flow, even if that means paying a higher price. The "building ahead of the capability curve" pattern I liked in Harvey only works when you can see the curve clearly. Here, the curve is agent adoption, not model capability, and it's far less predictable.
