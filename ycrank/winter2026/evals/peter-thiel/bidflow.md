# Bidflow -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most telling detail in this entire dossier is the contact email: founders@tryghostship.dev. A few months ago, these founders were building QA agents for bug detection. Now they are building AI for electrical estimating. The email domain hasn't even been updated. This is not a company built around a secret about the world — it is a search process. Two technically gifted young programmers are iterating through verticals looking for product-market fit, and they have landed on electrical contracting estimating as their current hypothesis. This is precisely the "lean startup" pattern I find least compelling: test, pivot, test again, until something sticks. The methodology is indefinite by design. When I ask "what important truth about the world does this company see that others do not?", the answer is not a conviction about the future of electrical contracting or the nature of construction technology. The answer is that they noticed a vertical where legacy software is old and AI hasn't fully arrived yet. That is an observation, not a secret.

The competitive landscape confirms the absence of a secret. Beam AI has $48 million in funding and 1,100 customers across multiple construction trades. Togal.AI has $17.5 million and is expanding its capabilities. Autodesk acquired ProEst. Countfire in the UK already does automated symbol counting for electrical drawings. Every sophisticated investor in construction technology can see that AI will transform blueprint analysis — this thesis is consensus, not contrarian. Bidflow's differentiation is narrowness: they focus exclusively on electrical, integrating NECA labor units and material pricing into a unified workflow. But vertical specialization within an already-crowded AI construction category is a positioning choice, not a monopoly strategy. Beam AI, with fifty times the capital and a thousand-plus customer base generating training data, could add deep electrical-specific features as a product line extension. The structural dynamics here are Girardian in the worst sense — multiple companies converging on the same fundamental insight, differentiated only by which trade they emphasize or which geography they target first.

The technology is competent but not discontinuous. The 83.5% accuracy figure is honest, and I give them credit for publishing it rather than obscuring it. But consider what it means: roughly one in six counts is wrong. For a contractor bidding on a data center project where margins may be 5-8%, systematic errors in the takeoff can mean the difference between winning profitably and winning at a loss. The Bass Electric testimonial claims a 5x reduction in estimate time, which is meaningful — but the product is an accelerant for an existing process, not a replacement for it. Estimators still review every output. This is a "1 to n" application of computer vision models that have improved dramatically across the industry since 2023. The underlying capability — recognizing symbols on engineering drawings — is not proprietary to Bidflow. Foundation model improvements will lower the barrier for any reasonably funded team to replicate this performance within eighteen months.

The strongest argument for investing is the beachhead logic and the data center timing. Electrical estimating in the U.S. Northeast is a small, specific market that a focused team could potentially dominate. The data center construction boom is creating genuine urgency — more projects, more complex electrical infrastructure, fewer experienced estimators. If Bidflow reaches 95%+ accuracy and becomes the default tool for mid-market electrical contractors in this corridor, they could build real switching costs through workflow dependency and a proprietary training data advantage from accumulated corrections. The founders' technical raw material is undeniable: USACO Platinum, Jane Street externship, a co-founder who bootstrapped to $120K revenue at sixteen. These are not dilettantes. If they develop genuine conviction about the future of construction technology — not just "this vertical has bad software" but a definite vision of how electrical contracting will be transformed — and if the data flywheel compounds faster than Beam AI's multi-trade approach can specialize, there is a path to a durable vertical SaaS business.

But a durable vertical SaaS business in a $2-4 billion market is not a power-law outcome. Even if Bidflow captures 10% of electrical estimating software revenue, that is $200-400 million — a good business, but not one that returns a fund. The founders have not articulated why electrical estimating is the wedge into something much larger, nor have they demonstrated the kind of civilizational conviction that distinguishes the companies I back. They are young, smart, and adaptable — qualities that the venture consensus values but that my framework treats with suspicion when unaccompanied by a definite plan. Adaptability is the virtue of the indefinite optimist. I invest in founders who would rather fail pursuing their specific vision than succeed by pivoting to whatever works. The pivot from Ghostship to Bidflow, executed in what appears to be weeks, signals exactly the opposite disposition. This is a pass.
