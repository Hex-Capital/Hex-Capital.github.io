# Mendral -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here are two founders who literally built the infrastructure the modern software industry runs on -- Docker's first employee and the creator of Docker Swarm -- and what they've chosen to do with that extraordinary position is make CI/CD pipelines fail less often. I look at that and think: you are too talented to spend your careers on a problem this small. If Mendral achieves everything it's attempting, the result is that engineering teams spend fewer hours debugging broken builds. That's a real annoyance solved. It is not an industry transformed. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The consequence of maximum success here is a good DevOps tool company -- perhaps worth a few billion dollars in the best case -- in a crowded market where Harness just raised at $5.5 billion and every CI/CD vendor on the planet is bolting AI onto their platform. I have spent forty years looking for companies where success means the world operates differently. Fixing flaky tests faster does not clear that bar.

What makes this evaluation more pointed is that Sam Alba and Andrea Luzzardi are the archetype of the founder profile I explicitly avoid for transformational bets. They are the ultimate insiders: over a decade together at Docker and then Dagger, both from EPITECH, both steeped in the exact system they're now incrementally improving. My experience -- Juniper, Rocket Lab, Impossible Foods -- is that the deepest innovations come from people who don't know what the industry considers impossible. These founders know every failure mode, every integration pattern, every customer complaint about CI/CD. That knowledge makes them excellent at optimization. It is precisely the "set of biases that prevent you from making mistakes but also prevent you from inventing." An outsider might ask why CI/CD pipelines exist in their current form at all. These founders ask how to patch them when they break. That is the difference between disruptive and incremental innovation.

The technology concern compounds this. The dossier states it plainly: "Any team with CI/CD domain expertise and access to frontier LLMs could build a similar agent." Mendral is an application layer on top of someone else's breakthrough. The LLMs that make CI failure diagnosis possible were built by OpenAI, Anthropic, and others -- Mendral consumes that capability, it doesn't create it. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu had invented a fundamentally different router architecture that Cisco couldn't replicate without abandoning their own codebase. That is a technology moat. Wrapping an API call to a frontier model in a GitHub App and pointing it at CI logs is not. GitHub itself -- the platform Mendral depends on entirely -- could ship this as a Copilot feature and eliminate the need for a third-party agent overnight. The structural risk of building your entire company as an app on a platform controlled by a potential competitor is something I've watched destroy startups repeatedly.

The strongest bull case I can construct: these founders' decade of CI/CD experience means they understand failure patterns at a depth no LLM-wrapper startup can match. The "continuous learning loop" -- where each customer's deployment generates proprietary training data specific to their codebase -- could create a genuine data flywheel that compounds over time. Five paying customers including PostHog, SOC 2 Type II certification at pre-seed, and the ability to deliver fixes within hours of installation suggest real product-market resonance. If the data moat materializes and the learning loop produces measurably better fixes than any generic competitor, Mendral could own the autonomous DevOps agent category the way Square owned mobile payments. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that (a) the accumulated failure-pattern data creates an insurmountable lead, (b) GitHub and Harness are too slow to build this natively, and (c) the product expands from CI remediation into a full autonomous engineering platform handling security, performance, and compliance. I find each of these assumptions individually plausible but collectively unlikely -- especially given the attention split with Dagger, which the founders appear to still be running.

The timing argument deserves acknowledgment: LLMs crossed a code-generation threshold in 2023-2024 that makes autonomous CI remediation viable for the first time, and the founders are positioned early on that curve. But "AI for DevOps" is not a secret. Harness raised $614 million and is valued at $5.5 billion specifically for AI-powered software delivery. Every DevOps vendor is adding AI capabilities. This is not 2019 AI or 2004 cleantech, where I was investing before the trend existed. This is consensus technology applied to a well-understood problem. I look for exponential curves before they reach mainstream awareness. This curve is already on the cover of every DevOps trade publication.

I pass. Not because the founders lack ability -- they are clearly exceptional engineers. Not because the market doesn't exist -- DevOps is real and growing. But because the consequence of success, even full success, is an incremental improvement to an existing system in a market where well-funded competitors are converging on the same capability. These founders reduced their probability of failure admirably -- strong domain expertise, working product, paying customers, enterprise compliance. And in doing so, they reduced the consequence of success to something that doesn't justify the opportunity cost of two people this talented.
