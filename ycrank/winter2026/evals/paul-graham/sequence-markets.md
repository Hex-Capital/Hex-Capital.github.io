# Sequence Markets -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is what's missing from this story: the moment of pain. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer appears to be that Peter Bai studied market microstructure at Ivey, worked at TMX Group and a pension fund, and concluded that crypto execution quality was a real market. That's a perfectly reasonable way to identify a business opportunity. It's also exactly how startup ideas get manufactured rather than discovered. The best execution infrastructure companies I've seen started because someone was actually trading and getting destroyed by slippage -- they were losing their own money, or watching a fund bleed basis points on every fill, and they snapped. There's no evidence of that here. This reads like someone with relevant knowledge identified a gap in the market. That's not the same thing as stumbling into a problem you can't walk away from.

The deeper issue is that this problem isn't hiding in plain sight. It's in plain sight, and a half-dozen well-funded companies are already staring directly at it. CoinRoutes has a patent on smart order routing in crypto. Talos just raised at $1.5B with Robinhood as a strategic investor. FalconX sits at $8B. Wyden is onboarding European banks. This is the opposite of schlep blindness -- the schlep is fully visible and being actively attacked with hundreds of millions of dollars. When I wrote about Stripe, the key insight wasn't just that payments were painful. It was that thousands of hackers had been unconsciously avoiding the problem for years despite knowing it existed. The Collisons walked into that vacuum. There is no vacuum here. There's a crowded room of incumbents expanding rapidly through acquisitions and partnerships. The "non-custodial, venue-neutral" positioning is a coherent differentiation on paper, but it's the kind of strategic positioning that emerges from competitive analysis, not from a founder who built something they personally needed.

The bull case would go something like this: MiCA best execution mandates create sudden regulatory demand. Tokenization of real-world assets creates a new asset class that existing infrastructure doesn't handle well. Incumbents are bloated prime brokerages with conflicted order flow, and a lightweight execution-only layer could win the way Stripe won against PayPal's heavy infrastructure. Peter Bai's TMX experience gives him genuine insight into how exchange infrastructure works at scale. If the timing is right and institutions want unbundled execution technology without the prime brokerage lock-in, a focused startup could capture the wedge before incumbents react. I'd need to believe that, and I'd also need to believe that two founders -- one an undergraduate club president and the other an incoming software engineering intern -- can build sub-millisecond latency institutional execution systems that compete with teams of hundreds. That's a lot to believe.

About the founders specifically: I can see the domain knowledge in Bai's background. Working at a stock exchange and managing macro trading at a $12.8B pension fund is meaningful, especially for someone early in their career. But Awan's profile -- Waterloo Quant Club, incoming Databricks intern -- describes someone at the starting line of a career, not someone who's been building production infrastructure. There are no public GitHub repositories for either founder, no open-source work, no technical blog posts, no published research. For a company claiming AI-powered routing with sub-millisecond latency, I want to see that the founders actually wrote code. The absence of any visible technical output is concerning. At YC, the companies that work in fintech infrastructure are almost always built by founders who can personally construct the system -- the Collisons wrote Stripe, Drew Houston wrote Dropbox's sync engine. When the core product is an execution algorithm and nobody can show me code, I get nervous.

The "$15B+ liquidity" claim on the website describes how many exchanges they've connected to, not how much trading flows through them. Zero public revenue data, zero user metrics, zero press coverage. At pre-seed this isn't unusual, and I don't penalize for it mechanically. But combined with the competitive landscape -- CoinRoutes with a patent, Talos with $150M in funding, FalconX at $8B -- the absence of any evidence that institutions are pulling this product toward them makes the bet feel like it requires faith in the founders' ability to out-execute dramatically better-resourced competitors. That kind of faith needs to be grounded in either extreme founder quality or organic problem-founder fit. I see a reasonable problem-founder connection but not the kind of deep organic fit that overrides everything else.
