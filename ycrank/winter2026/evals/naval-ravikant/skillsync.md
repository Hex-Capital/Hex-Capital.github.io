# Skillsync -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The structural problem with Skillsync is that it's building on someone else's leverage rather than creating its own. GitHub is Microsoft's platform. The data is public. The API is available to everyone. LLMs that understand code semantics are becoming commodity infrastructure. When you're sourcing your raw material from a platform controlled by a company that also owns LinkedIn — the dominant professional graph — you're not building leverage, you're renting it. Microsoft could ship a "Skills" tab on every GitHub profile tomorrow and the entire value proposition evaporates. I learned this lesson watching companies build on Twitter's API in the early days: the platform giveth, and the platform taketh away. The companies that survive are the ones that create their own gravity, not the ones that orbit someone else's.

The founders have genuine open-source experience — they worked together at Juspay building Hyperswitch, a Rust payments switch they grew to 20K+ stars. That's real. They've managed a community of hundreds of contributors and experienced firsthand the difficulty of identifying who's actually skilled versus who's just prolific. Nishant Joshi's Rust depth is credible (shelgon with 271 stars, 100+ repos, core contributor to a 40K-star project). But I need to distinguish between "experienced the problem" and "possess non-transferable knowledge about the solution." Any open-source maintainer who's managed a significant project has noticed that GitHub profiles don't capture skill well. The insight is common; the execution question is whether LLM-based code analysis produces skill profiles accurate enough that recruiters pay $499/month for them. That's an engineering question, not a knowledge question. And engineering questions, by definition, can be answered by other competent engineers.

The leverage architecture doesn't excite me. This is a sourcing tool for recruiters — a search engine with a per-seat subscription. Each new customer doesn't make the product meaningfully better for other customers. There are no network effects because the developers being profiled don't participate and haven't opted in. Compare this to Stack Overflow, which I backed: every question asked and answered made the knowledge graph denser, and developers actively contributed because they received reputation and career benefits in return. Skillsync's relationship with its "supply side" is extractive rather than generative. The developers whose code is being analyzed have no incentive to engage, and many will actively object. You can't build durable infrastructure on a relationship where half your ecosystem doesn't know you exist and might resent you when they find out.

Here's the bull case I genuinely considered: if LLMs have just crossed the threshold where deep code analysis is feasible, and Skillsync is first to build a comprehensive, accurate skill graph across millions of developers, that dataset could compound in ways that matter. Whoever indexes first and iterates on accuracy first could develop a real lead. The AI/ML talent shortage is severe, specialized systems engineers are nearly impossible to source through LinkedIn, and $499/month is trivial for any company trying to fill a $300K+ role. If Skillsync can demonstrate measurably better hire outcomes for systems and infrastructure roles — the exact niche where traditional sourcing fails hardest — the product sells itself. The repositioning from "discover hidden talent in your codebase" to "find anyone in open source" might signal founders who are iterating fast toward real demand rather than founders without conviction. And the Juspay experience means they understand the open-source developer psyche from inside it.

But the bull case requires believing that code-analysis-based sourcing is a standalone business rather than a feature. SeekOut has $189M in funding and an existing recruiter customer base — adding a code analysis layer is a product sprint for them, not a company. HireEZ could do the same. LinkedIn, with access to both the professional graph and GitHub data through Microsoft, is the obvious winner if this category materializes. The timing isn't contrarian — it's consensus. Everyone in tech recruiting already knows that GitHub contributions matter more than resumes for engineering roles. Skillsync isn't saying something most people disagree with; it's automating something most people already believe. That's useful, but it's not where asymmetric returns come from. The no-opt-in model creates an additional headwind: developer communities can be hostile to tools that surveil them without consent, and a backlash could poison the well before the company reaches scale.

Two-person team, no disclosed traction, a Product Hunt launch with 3 upvotes, and a product positioning that has already shifted once — these are all normal at pre-seed, so I won't penalize for them. What I will note is the absence of any signal that this company creates a new form of leverage that didn't previously exist. Better search for recruiters is incremental. It's "SeekOut but for code" — the exact vertical SaaS pattern I avoid. Smart founders, real problem, but the wrong architecture for the kind of compounding, leverage-creating business I want to own for a decade.
