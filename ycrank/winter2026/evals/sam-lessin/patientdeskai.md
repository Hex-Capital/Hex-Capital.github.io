# Patientdesk.ai -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what struck me first about Patientdesk: if I were constructing the platonic ideal of a company that fails every filter in my framework, it would look almost exactly like this. An AI voice agent that replaces dental receptionists. The AI isn't the cherry on top — it's the entire sundae. Remove the AI and you have... a call center. Which, incidentally, is what the founders used to run. I say this not to be dismissive of the team — there's actually something interesting in the agency-to-product arc — but because the structural position is exactly the kind I've been publicly arguing against for two years. "Would this business be good if AI didn't exist?" No. It wouldn't exist at all.

The sane-person-insane-idea calibration lands poorly here because the idea isn't insane — it's one of the most consensus AI applications in the market right now. "Replace the receptionist with an AI voice agent" is the demo that every voice AI startup shows at every pitch night. Arini is building literally the same product, one YC batch ahead, founded by MIT/Harvard engineers who were early at Threads. Sully.ai has raised $35M doing AI healthcare employees across multiple verticals. Weave, which already serves 35,000 dental locations and generates $230M in trailing revenue, has announced AI receptionist features. When the publicly traded incumbent, the well-funded specialist, and a direct YC-batch predecessor are all converging on your exact product — you're not pursuing a non-consensus idea, you're pursuing the consensus at a smaller scale.

The founders do have genuine domain credibility that's worth acknowledging. Özgül ran a call center for dental practices and co-founded ESO Marketing Automations, a dental agency operating in the UAE and Australia. Koktas has a physics degree from Pomona and is pursuing an ML master's at Aalto. They lived inside the workflow they're automating, which is the right origin story — it's the Craftwork pattern, in theory. But the Craftwork comparison actually illuminates what's missing: Craftwork's moat is physical. Painting crews, trucks, scheduling complexity, quality control on job sites. Software makes it better, but the operational layer cannot be commoditized by cheaper code. Patientdesk's entire value delivery is software — an LLM generating voice responses, API calls to PMS systems, and insurance verification lookups. Every component is accessible to any competitor with competent engineers. The PMS integrations with 15+ systems create real switching friction, I'll grant that, but integration work is labor, not a moat. Every competitor will build the same Dentrix and Eaglesoft connectors because they have to.

The strongest bull case — and I want to take it seriously — goes like this: dental practices are technologically backward, relationship-driven, and deeply fragmented. The founders' agency relationships give them distribution that pure-tech competitors lack. At 60+ clinics and $1K/month per location, they may already have meaningful revenue for a pre-seed company, and the ROI story is compelling because a single high-value booking covers months of subscription cost. If they can lock in enough practices fast enough, the patient data and workflow customization becomes the switching cost, not the AI itself. The expansion narrative runs from voice agent to full front-office automation to dental practice operating system. The path from "agency that serves dental clinics" to "platform that runs dental operations" has historical precedent. And the fact that they're exhibiting at ADX — the largest dental conference in the world — suggests real commercial seriousness. If everything breaks right, this could be a $200M+ outcome in dental vertical SaaS. But that ceiling IS the problem. $200M outcomes in vertical SaaS where you're competing with a public company that has 35K locations don't produce venture returns at the scale I need. And the "everything breaks right" scenario requires outrunning Weave's distribution, Arini's engineering, and the inevitable commoditization of voice AI — all with a three-person team spread across the US, Australia, and the UK.

The $1,000/month subscription model is the final red flag. This is the pricing architecture I've been explicitly arguing is structurally doomed. Software-as-subscription assumes the software is the moat, but when the software is an LLM voice agent configured for dental workflows, the moat is dissolving in real time. Every improvement in foundation models makes it easier for a competitor — or for Weave to add a checkbox feature — that does 80% of what Patientdesk does. The founders are building where AI is the product rather than where AI is the accelerant, and that's the exact inverse of where I want to deploy capital.
