# SpotPay -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I see when I look at SpotPay isn't the founder story or the technology -- it's the capital table of everyone else already in the room. Kontigo raised $20 million at a $100 million valuation and is running at $30 million annualized revenue with a million users. Plasma has $74 million in the bank and Peter Thiel on speed dial. Slash closed a $41 million Series B at $370 million. And right here inside Y Combinator itself there's Pana, founded by someone who was literally Head of Digital Banking at Scotiabank Caribbean and Central America -- the exact corridors SpotPay is targeting. When I invest, I'm looking for ideas that are unpopular and difficult to assess -- companies other investors have dismissed or can't understand. Stablecoin neobanking in 2026 is the opposite of that. This is a category where consensus has already formed and capital is flooding in. The weirdness, if it was ever there, has been fully priced.

Now let me talk about Zsika, because the story always comes first for me. He grew up between the Caribbean and Latin America and felt the pain of moving money across borders -- that's real, and I believe him. But when I ask myself whether this founder's biography and this company's mission are inseparable, the answer gets complicated. Zsika's last company was Astros AI, a mobile game monetization platform at Techstars Seattle in 2023. That's a genuinely different problem in a genuinely different industry. I'm not opposed to founders who pivot -- I've seen it work -- but what I'm listening for is the person who couldn't NOT build this thing, who has been circling this problem their whole life. The cross-border payments pain is shared by millions of people in diaspora communities. It's a real problem, but experiencing it doesn't make you the singular person who must solve it the way that, say, Contraline's founder spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone would fund him. Zsika has strong credentials -- Stanford MBA, Purdue CS, Google PM -- but credentials and biographical necessity are different things.

Thomas as CTO is the strongest individual signal in this company. Engineer number four at Brex, rising to Principal Software Engineer, building observability infrastructure for financial systems at scale -- that's directly relevant domain expertise for building a neobank. If I were evaluating the team purely on whether they can build the product, Thomas's background gives me real confidence. The problem isn't whether they can build it; it's whether they can win the corridor war against teams with 20 to 40 times more capital already deployed.

The bull case deserves real engagement, because the economic access dimension here is powerful and it maps to something I care deeply about. When I backed Affirm, part of the conviction came from seeing how credit card companies exploited opacity -- hidden fees, confusing terms, predatory compounding. Western Union and the correspondent banking system exploit the same kind of opacity for cross-border remittances. A family in Trinidad sending money to a relative in Brooklyn shouldn't lose 7-10% to intermediaries and multi-day delays. Stablecoin rails can structurally compress those costs the way Affirm structurally made interest transparent. If SpotPay can build deep trust and liquidity in specific Caribbean and Latin American corridors -- becoming the product that a Trinidadian nurse in Miami uses every payday -- the network effects within tight-knit diaspora communities could create real defensibility that the broader-market competitors won't match. That's a genuine path.

But the "if" is doing enormous work in that sentence. Building corridor-specific liquidity, local payment method integrations, and community trust requires capital, regulatory licenses in each receiving country, and time -- all resources where SpotPay is at a massive disadvantage. The FinCEN MSB registration is table-stakes, not a moat. Card issuance programs are commercially available. And the stablecoin neobank product itself -- wallet, card, cross-border transfers -- is technically reproducible by any team with fintech and crypto engineering experience. When I backed Crusoe Energy, there was no one else trying to mine Bitcoin on flare gas. When I backed SpaceX, private space was considered insane. Here, there are at least four well-funded companies building essentially the same thing. I don't invest when consensus has already formed around a category -- I'm looking for the pocket of dreamers that nobody else has found yet, and this pocket has been thoroughly discovered.

The 9 ratings on the App Store and absence of any public traction data tell me this is very early, which is fine for pre-seed -- that's not the concern. The concern is whether this team, at this stage, with this level of funding, can carve out defensible territory in a category that's attracting hundreds of millions in venture capital. I respect the economic mission and I respect Thomas's Brex pedigree. But I don't feel the jolt. The category is too hot, the competition too capitalized, and the founder-problem connection, while real, isn't the deep biographical thread I need to write a conviction check from my own money.
