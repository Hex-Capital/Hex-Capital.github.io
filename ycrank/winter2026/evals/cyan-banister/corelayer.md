# Corelayer -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Corelayer: this is a consensus category. Resolve AI just closed $125 million at a billion-dollar valuation building autonomous SRE tools. incident.io raised $96 million. BigPanda has taken $431 million. When I see that kind of capital concentration in a space, the signal I'm reading isn't "validated market" -- it's "the weirdness has already been arbitraged away." AI-powered debugging and incident management is what every enterprise-focused AI startup is pitching right now. The most promising companies I've backed were ones nobody else wanted to fund. SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, Crusoe when people laughed at mining Bitcoin on gas flares. Corelayer's data-pipeline-specific angle is a reasonable differentiation, but it's an incremental positioning choice within a hot market, not the kind of insight that makes other investors uncomfortable.

When I sit down with founders, I don't start with the product or the TAM slide. I want to hear the story -- how did you get here, what shaped you, what broke you and what you rebuilt from the pieces. What I can see about Mitch and Shipra is a credentialed path: Michigan, Princeton astrophysics, CMU computer science, Oracle, Goldman Sachs. These are clearly capable people with genuine domain expertise. They debugged systems processing hundreds of billions of rows daily at one of the world's most demanding financial institutions. That's real founder-market fit. But founder-market fit and the biographical grit I look for are different things. I'm listening for the hardship that makes this founder the only person who could solve this problem -- the thing that means they'll keep going when the company hits its inevitable crisis. That story might exist for Mitch and Shipra, but it's not visible in anything I can see here, and my entire evaluation method depends on that biographical transparency.

The strongest case for Corelayer -- and I want to be honest about what's genuinely compelling -- lives in regulated industry infrastructure. On-prem deployments and confidential compute for financial services, healthcare, and insurance is hard to build and harder to sell. They've already achieved SOC 2 Type I certification as a two-person team, which tells me they understand that compliance isn't a checkbox but the actual product in these environments. My background at IronPort taught me that security and compliance infrastructure in regulated sectors creates real switching costs -- once you're embedded in a bank's production environment with access to their sensitive data flows, ripping you out is painful. If Corelayer becomes the trusted debugging layer inside three or four major financial institutions, that position gets very defensible. Cloud-native competitors like Datadog would have to build entirely new deployment architectures that conflict with their margin structures to follow them there. That's a genuine moat thesis.

But here's where I get stuck: a two-person team selling into Fortune 100 financial services companies faces a brutal timing mismatch. Enterprise procurement at banks and insurers isn't measured in weeks or months -- it's measured in quarters and years. Security reviews, vendor assessments, compliance audits, legal negotiations. Even with Goldman Sachs network connections, converting those warm introductions into signed contracts while burning through pre-seed capital requires a patience and a sales infrastructure that's extremely difficult to build at this stage. And the value proposition -- saving engineering time for teams making $200K a year -- is a cost optimization pitch, not the kind of transformative economic access that pulls me in. Uber didn't just make transportation more efficient; it created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. Affirm didn't just reduce credit card fees; it gave transparent credit access to people the system had excluded. Corelayer helps Fortune 100 companies spend less on production support. That's a real business, but it's not the kind of impact that gets me to write a check from my own money.

The co-founder dynamic has one positive signal: Mitch and Shipra worked together at Goldman Sachs building data infrastructure, so they've been in the trenches on the actual problem domain before starting a company together. That's better than co-founders who met at a hackathon. But I learned from HQ Trivia that shared professional history isn't the same as stress-tested conflict resolution, and I don't have visibility into how these two navigate disagreement when things get hard -- which they inevitably will, especially when enterprise sales cycles stretch longer than runway.

I respect what Corelayer is building. The regulated-industry wedge is smart, the technical approach of data-content-level debugging versus infrastructure metrics is a real differentiation, and the founders clearly know this problem domain from the inside. If someone told me this company succeeded and became the standard debugging layer for every major financial institution, I could see the path. But nothing here gives me that jolt -- that visceral feeling I had with Niantic, or the sense that these founders arrived at an insight so strange and so personal that nobody else could see it yet. This reads as competent people building a logical product in a popular category, and that's just not where I invest.
