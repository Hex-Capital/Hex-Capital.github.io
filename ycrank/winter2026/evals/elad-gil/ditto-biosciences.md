# Ditto Biosciences -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Mining parasitic worm genomes for autoimmune drug candidates is exactly the kind of idea that triggers dismissive reactions from most investors -- and that's what makes it analytically interesting to me. When I hear "too weird," I lean in. PagerDuty was "just alerting," Gusto was "just payroll," and the investors who dismissed those markets missed category-defining companies. Ditto Bio fits the "too weird to fund" archetype cleanly: three PhD scientists mining an evolutionary biology goldmine that pharma organizations don't have the interdisciplinary muscle to access. The problem is that my single-miracle framework punishes this company severely, and I can't override it just because the market archetype is favorable.

The structural moment here is real but moderate. What's changed is computational protein biology -- AlphaFold2 in 2021, AlphaFold3 in 2024, and the broader collapse in cost of genomic analysis. Five years ago, systematically screening a million parasite proteins against human immune targets would have been a decade-long academic project. Today a three-person team can do it at pre-seed. That's a genuine capability threshold being crossed, and the timing is credible. But the autoimmune therapeutics market itself isn't at an inflection -- it's an $80 billion market that's been large and well-funded for years. The "why now" applies to the discovery methodology, not to the market demand. Compare this to Harvey, where the GPT-4 capability jump was about to unlock an entirely new category of product. Here, the AlphaFold-era tools enable a better discovery approach within an existing category. That's valuable but structurally less explosive.

Where the company genuinely impresses me is founder-domain fit and scientific execution velocity. Three scientists who spent three years together at Arcadia Science -- a startup focused on non-model organism biology, which is directly relevant to mining understudied parasites -- and who collectively bring parasitology (Borges), computational genomics (Sun), and microbiology/sequencing (Weiss). Borges has 50+ papers and a patent for anti-CRISPR proteins, demonstrating she generates IP, not just publications. Sun brings operational chops from a Chief of Staff role. For a pre-seed team, analyzing 1M+ proteins and producing candidates with 1-2 nM binding affinities is serious scientific output -- that's not a slide deck, that's working infrastructure. The co-founder relationship has been stress-tested in a startup environment, which addresses one of the three things I believe kills pre-PMF companies.

The bull case requires taking the platform view seriously. If the discovery engine works, Ditto isn't a single-drug company -- it's a systematic search across every parasite-host interaction for immunomodulatory candidates across rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, psoriasis, MS, lupus, Type 1 diabetes. Each indication is a separate multi-billion-dollar market. The proprietary database becomes a distribution channel for multiple therapeutic programs and pharma partnerships, analogous to how Stripe's developer integration distributes Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. The Pandion Therapeutics exit to Merck at $1.9B validates that novel protein therapeutics in autoimmune disease can create massive acquirer interest. And the interdisciplinary talent moat -- parasitology plus computational genomics plus protein engineering -- is genuinely difficult to replicate. You can't assemble this team by posting on LinkedIn.

But here's where my framework forces a clear-eyed pass. The path from "proteins with good binding affinity" to "FDA-approved therapeutic" requires at least four sequential miracles: computational identification works (partially demonstrated), immunogenicity can be solved (acknowledged but unresolved -- they're building a tissue biobank, which tells me they know this is hard), preclinical efficacy validates in animal models, and clinical trials succeed for a novel modality with limited regulatory precedent. Each of these has meaningfully less than 50% probability. Compound those odds and the expected value drops fast. When I funded Color Health, the single miracle was driving down genetic testing costs through lab automation -- hard but focused. When I look at Ditto, the team hasn't collapsed their challenge to one obstacle. The immunogenicity problem alone could invalidate the entire approach regardless of how good the discovery engine is. Companies requiring multiple sequential breakthroughs multiply low-probability events, and I've been disciplined about this principle even when the science is compelling.

I respect the team, the approach is genuinely novel, and the "too weird for most investors" pattern is one I track carefully. But regulatory novelty risk cuts both ways here -- it can create a moat, but a parasite-derived protein modality with no FDA precedent adds timeline uncertainty on top of already long biotech development cycles. The well-funded competitive landscape ($200M+ raised each by Seismic, Anokion, and Sonoma) means Ditto is competing for the same clinical endpoints with a fraction of the resources, and while their approach is differentiated, the endpoints are shared. This is a pass on multi-miracle grounds, not on team or market quality.
