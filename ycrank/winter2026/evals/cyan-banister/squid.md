# Squid -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's my honest tension with Squid: this is exactly the kind of company that every climate-tech and infrastructure investor in the Valley can immediately understand. Grid modernization, browser-native SaaS replacing legacy desktop tools, AI-powered planning -- that pitch lands clean in any partner meeting. Neara just raised $90M at a billion-dollar valuation doing adjacent work. The DOE is funding grid AI initiatives. Electricity demand from data centers is tripling. And that's precisely my problem. The most promising companies I've backed were ones that made people uncomfortable or confused. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, people thought private rockets were absurd. When I backed Crusoe, people thought mining Bitcoin on gas flares was insane. Grid planning SaaS is not insane. It's a sensible modernization play in a category that's already attracting real capital. When consensus forms this early around a market, the weirdness premium I look for has already been arbitraged away.

What I want to know -- and what the dossier doesn't tell me -- is the founders' personal stories. Not their resumes. Conor Jones went from BCG to National Grid to Octopus Energy, and George Kolokotronis has a Cambridge MPhil, led technology at Octopus, and worked in AI at AWS. Those are strong professional credentials, and George being a second-time cleantech founder with VoltQuant (which already had National Grid and Octopus as customers) tells me he's persistent in this domain. But when I ask "how did you get here?" I'm listening for something deeper than a career progression through the UK energy sector. I want to hear about the moment that broke them open and made this problem feel personal -- not professional, personal. Maybe that story exists and I just can't see it from the dossier. But the biographical signal I rely on most heavily to evaluate pre-seed founders isn't present here, and I've learned not to fill in gaps with assumptions.

Now, the bull case deserves real engagement because there's something here that does activate one of my patterns. Squid is doing what Carta did for cap tables and what Affirm did for credit -- taking a system that lived in opaque spreadsheets and fragmented tools and making it visible, versioned, and shared. National Grid DSO's head of flexibility markets literally said "For too long flex data lived in spreadsheets. Not anymore!" That's the transparency-over-opacity signal I've followed across my portfolio without ever naming it explicitly. And the fact that a pre-seed company already has National Grid deploying their FlexPortal in production, with press coverage in three trade publications, plus SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications -- that's extraordinary execution for a two-person team. If I were evaluating this purely on founder-market fit and early enterprise traction, I'd be more excited. These founders know their customers because they literally were their customers.

The regulatory complexity angle also works in their favor. Utilities are slow, procurement-heavy buyers with compliance requirements that take years to navigate. Squid having those certifications already creates a real barrier -- I learned from my IronPort days that security and compliance certifications aren't just checkboxes, they're moats that take time and discipline to build. And the structural position is interesting: legacy tools (PSS/E, Synergi, CYME) are trapped in perpetual license business models that make it painful to rebuild as cloud-native SaaS. Envelio, the most direct modern competitor, got acquired by E.ON, which limits its ability to sell to E.ON's competitors. That's a real structural opening.

But when I step back and run this through my full framework, I keep returning to the same conclusion: this is a well-credentialed team building a smart product in a market that other investors already understand and are funding aggressively. The founders didn't arrive at some insight that seemed ridiculous -- they saw a workflow problem at their former employers and decided to build the obvious solution. That's a valid way to build a company, and it might even be a great company. But it's not my kind of bet. I'm drawn to the founders who've been told no fifty times, who are building something that makes most people uncomfortable, who carry a personal stake that goes beyond professional observation. Squid feels like a company that will attract plenty of capital from investors who evaluate domain expertise and market timing. They don't need me, and my particular pattern recognition doesn't give me an edge here.
