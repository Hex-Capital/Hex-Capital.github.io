# Remy AI -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking feature of Remy AI isn't what they're building -- it's who else is building it. Dexterity, Nimble Robotics, RightHand Robotics, Covariant, and Osaro have collectively raised over $970 million to automate warehouse manipulation. Google DeepMind launched Gemini Robotics. Physical Intelligence shipped π0. Stanford released OpenVLA as open source. When I backed Juniper Networks, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router -- the incumbents refused to pursue the approach. When I backed Impossible Foods, literally no one else on the planet was trying to replicate meat at the molecular level using plant-based heme. Here, everyone from billion-dollar startups to the largest AI labs in the world is pursuing the same goal with the same foundational technology. That's the opposite of the signal I look for. The question isn't whether warehouse robotics will transform logistics -- it will. The question is whether Remy AI has any structural reason to win.

The brownfield disruption angle is the bull case, and it deserves serious engagement. Eighty percent of US warehouses have no automation. The incumbents sell $100K-$150K systems designed for massive facilities. Their sales teams, their margin structures, their engineering -- all optimized for the top of the market. Remy claims 50% lower cost and deployment into existing workstations without facility redesign. This is textbook Christensen: start where the incumbents can't profitably serve, accumulate deployment data from the underserved 80%, and eventually move upmarket. If the data-efficient VLA training pipeline is real -- if they genuinely need less demonstration data to teach new tasks -- that could translate into dramatically lower deployment costs per warehouse. Combine that with hardware designed for brownfield sites rather than greenfield installations, and you have a path to serving 70,000 US 3PLs that nobody else is economically incentivized to pursue. If this works, it's a meaningful physical-world transformation: the majority of warehouses shift from manual labor to robotic handling, unlocking productivity gains across the entire logistics chain. That's worth something.

But here's where my framework exposes the gap: the consequence of Remy AI's success is bounded by competition in a way that my best investments never were. Even if they execute perfectly on brownfield mid-market, they're building toward a world where VLA-based warehouse robots are a commodity. OpenVLA is open source today. Any of the well-funded competitors could decide to package a cheaper, simpler offering for smaller 3PLs tomorrow. Nimble's fulfillment-as-a-service model already converts capital expenditure into operational expenditure, which addresses the affordability barrier from a different angle. The company's claimed differentiation -- the training pipeline's data efficiency -- is an unvalidated assertion, and it's precisely the kind of technical claim that erodes as foundation models improve across the ecosystem. When the underlying model architecture is available to everyone, "we fine-tune more efficiently" is a feature, not a moat.

The founding team is credentialed but conventional. Ben Kaye's CVPR 2025 publication and Oxford Visual Geometry Group pedigree represent legitimate computer vision depth -- this is real technical talent. Oscar Brisset's BCG X stint advising Fortune 500 logistics companies provides warehouse domain exposure. But both founders are doing exactly what their training prepared them for: an ML researcher building ML-powered robots, a consultant commercializing enterprise technology. There's no outsider audacity here, no one attempting what the experts say is impossible. I don't see evidence of rapid learning, abandoned assumptions, or contrarian bets -- the signals I care most about when evaluating founders. They're building a reasonable company in a reasonable market, and that's precisely the profile that concerns me. The probability of modest success may be reasonable, but the consequence of that success -- capturing a slice of a competitive market -- doesn't justify the effort relative to what these two could attempt.

The timing is real but consensus. VLA models crossing the capability threshold in 2024-2025 is the wave, and Remy is riding it along with everyone else. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was laughable to most investors -- that's four years of compounding returns I captured because I was early. When I entered cleantech in 2004, other VCs hadn't arrived yet. Remy AI is entering warehouse robotics at the exact moment when it's become one of the hottest investment categories in robotics. That's not skating to where the puck will be; it's arriving at the same time as the crowd. The technology trajectory is favorable, but it's favorable for everyone in the space equally.

I don't invest to capture a market share of an existing wave. I invest to fund the person or team that will create something the consensus says is impossible, in a domain where the consequence of getting it right reshapes how the world works. Warehouse automation is important, but Remy AI hasn't shown me why they -- specifically, uniquely, structurally -- would be the ones to transform it. Two Oxford graduates with strong credentials, a reasonable strategy, and a competitive market full of well-funded rivals. This is a bet on execution in a crowded race, not a bet on a contrarian insight that unlocks a transformational outcome.
