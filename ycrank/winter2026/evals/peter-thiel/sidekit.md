# SideKit -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the entire story before I even get to the founders. LaunchDarkly has raised $330 million and generates roughly $200 million in annual revenue selling feature flags. Statsig was acquired by OpenAI for $1.1 billion. Firebase Remote Config is free and embedded in millions of mobile apps worldwide, backed by the full weight of Google's infrastructure. DevCycle is a YC alum in the same space. Flagsmith is open-source. ConfigCat exists. Into this crowded arena walks a two-person team with seven GitHub stars proposing to bundle three commodity capabilities -- feature flags, analytics, and version gating -- into a single SDK. When I see five or six funded players already occupying a market, with a free Google product as the default option, I see a Girardian catastrophe in progress. Every participant is imitating the others, competing on minor differentiators, and destroying value for everyone involved. SideKit is not escaping competition; it is voluntarily entering a cage match.

What is the secret here? The implicit thesis is that mobile developers want a single lightweight SDK instead of assembling multiple tools. But this is not a secret -- it is a convenience preference that every product manager at Firebase, LaunchDarkly, and Statsig already understands. No intelligent person would disagree that bundling is simpler than fragmentation. A genuine secret must be a truth that most smart people actively reject. "Developers prefer fewer SDKs" is consensus dressed in startup language. The slightly deeper version -- that AI-assisted coding will create a new class of developers who need turnkey production infrastructure -- is also rapidly becoming consensus in the developer tools ecosystem. If every dev-tools investor at every YC Demo Day nods along with your thesis, you do not have a secret. You have a market trend, and market trends attract competition, which is the thing that destroys returns.

The technology question is decisive. SideKit bundles three capabilities that are individually well-understood and collectively unremarkable: event analytics, feature flags, and version gating. None of these represents a technological discontinuity. The "zero external dependencies" design is competent engineering, not a breakthrough. There is no proprietary algorithm, no novel data structure, no system that makes a previously impossible thing possible. This is definitionally a "1 to n" business -- taking things that already exist and packaging them together. Any of the incumbents I mentioned could replicate this exact bundle in a single engineering sprint. LaunchDarkly could ship version gating as a feature next quarter. Firebase could add privacy-first analytics mode. The technical barrier to replication is close to zero, which means SideKit's advantage is ephemeral by construction.

The strongest bull case requires me to consider the Stripe analogy: a simple, developer-friendly tool that captures the ecosystem from the bottom up despite the existence of established payment processors. Ashish Selvaraj has genuine founder-market fit -- he shipped an iOS app to 50,000 users, experienced the fragmented tooling pain firsthand, and wrote about building private analytics for his own Sudoku app. That lived experience is real and specific. If SideKit could become the default production bundle for every new mobile app -- the way Stripe became the default payments integration -- the TAM math could work. But the analogy breaks on two structural points. First, Stripe's integration was orders of magnitude simpler than legacy payment processors (seven lines of code versus weeks of integration), creating a genuine 10x improvement. SideKit's bundling advantage is marginal: replacing three SDK imports with one is convenient but not transformative. Second, Stripe benefits from massive switching costs -- once you process payments through Stripe, migration involves financial risk and regulatory complexity. Swapping an analytics SDK requires changing a few lines of code and losing some historical data. The moat that made Stripe a monopoly simply does not exist in this market.

The pricing structure reveals the power-law problem. At $42 per month for the top tier, SideKit needs an enormous number of paying customers to reach venture-scale revenue. This is not a company that can return the fund. Even in the optimistic scenario where SideKit captures ten thousand paying Growth-tier customers -- a feat that would require years of execution against entrenched incumbents -- annual revenue would be approximately $5 million. This ceiling is structural, not a matter of execution quality. The founders are building a small business in a competitive market, not a monopoly with the potential for power-law returns.

I respect that Ashish built something real and experienced the problem firsthand. His trajectory from indie developer to tool-builder follows a coherent logic. But the world is full of coherent businesses that never achieve monopoly. The absence of a contrarian secret, the commodity nature of the technology, the zero switching costs, and the presence of a free Google product as the default option make this precisely the kind of investment I avoid. This company will compete, and in my framework, that sentence is a complete evaluation.
