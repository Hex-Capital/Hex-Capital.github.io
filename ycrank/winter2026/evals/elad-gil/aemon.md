# Aemon -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Aemon is the commoditization problem, and it's severe. The core technique -- evolutionary search using LLMs to iterate on code -- is already open-source. OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve all exist on GitHub. Multiple independent teams have matched or surpassed the circle packing benchmark that Aemon touts as its primary proof point. The 36kr article attributes a superior circle packing result to a student using a framework called "Tactical Maniac v0.5." When your marquee technical achievement is being reproduced by individual students and weekend open-source projects, you don't have a technology moat -- you have a science fair demonstration. This triggers my "software-aware vs. software-driven" test hard. Is Aemon building fundamental competitive advantage through software, or is it wrapping a well-documented technique in a product layer? Right now, the evidence points toward the latter.

The structural moment here is real but consensus. AlphaEvolve was front-page news in May 2025. LLM inference costs have cratered. Code generation quality crossed a usability threshold. Every investor in the ecosystem can see that LLMs enable evolutionary optimization. Compare this to when I looked at Coinbase -- crypto infrastructure was genuinely unfamiliar territory that triggered reflexive dismissal from most investors. Or PagerDuty -- operations alerting seemed too boring to warrant venture funding. Aemon sits in the opposite archetype: "AI beats DeepMind!" is the kind of narrative that attracts attention, not the kind that repels it. The $4.72B "AI for Scientific Discovery" TAM is a generic analyst number with no clear mapping to what Aemon actually does -- which is computational optimization work that could range from retrieval systems to algorithm design to mathematical proofs. That breadth is a problem, not a feature. It suggests the team hasn't identified a specific market wedge where they can build density and distribution.

Speaking of distribution -- I see no evidence of it. The go-to-market is "Book a Discovery Call," which is a high-touch consulting motion. The legal retrieval case study and the circle packing benchmark come from completely different domains, suggesting bespoke engagements rather than a repeatable product. When I evaluate whether a company can become a distribution channel, I need to see how the initial product creates a customer relationship that makes additional products natural. Stripe's API integration was a distribution strategy from day one -- once you're processing payments through Stripe, adding Billing and Atlas is frictionless. Aemon's optimization runs appear domain-specific and project-scoped. A legal retrieval optimization doesn't naturally lead to the customer buying circle packing optimization. Each engagement starts from scratch. That's a services business wearing a product company's clothes, and it structurally caps the upside I'm looking for.

Here's the bull case I want to engage with honestly: these founders are genuinely impressive. Twin brothers, both publishing at ICLR and EMNLP before age 20, international mathematics medals, dropped out to build this. That's precocious technical talent, and twin co-founders eliminate the co-founder conflict risk that kills many early companies. If they can figure out that their real product isn't "evolutionary search as a service" but rather "the platform that engineering teams use to optimize any codebase" -- and if they build that platform with enough product quality, reliability, and workflow integration that enterprises choose Aemon over rolling their own with OpenEvolve -- there's a path to something meaningful. The <$10 compute claim, if genuine, suggests algorithmic efficiency advantages that aren't captured in the open-source implementations. And Google keeping AlphaEvolve internal does create a window. But the window is against open-source alternatives, not against absence of alternatives -- and that's a much harder competitive dynamic to win.

The technology cycle positioning is the final concern. Harvey succeeded because it built *ahead* of the capability curve -- legal AI workflow tools before GPT-4 proved legal AI was viable. When the capability arrived, Harvey had the enterprise relationships and domain expertise to capture the market. Aemon is building *after* AlphaEvolve proved the approach works, which means they're competing in a validated space alongside multiple teams who saw the same demonstration. Being post-validation is fine if you have a distribution moat or a structural advantage that compounds. I don't see either here. What I see is technically gifted young founders chasing a benchmark that's already being commoditized, in a market that sounds exciting but lacks a defined wedge, with a go-to-market that looks like consulting. The founders have the raw talent to build something significant -- but this particular framing needs a sharper market insight and a distribution strategy before it becomes my kind of bet.
