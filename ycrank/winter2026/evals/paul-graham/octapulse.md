# OctaPulse -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I want to understand about any company is how the founders found the problem. And with OctaPulse, the answer concerns me. Neither founder has ever worked in aquaculture. Paul Grech was a UX project manager at Bloomberg who went to CMU for an MBA. Rohan Singh is a mechanical engineer turned robotics student with stints at Tesla and NVIDIA. Their entry point into fish hatchery inspection appears to be Grech's stated interest in ocean conservation plus the pair's CMU robotics capabilities. This is the pattern I've warned about in "How to Get Startup Ideas" -- smart people at a good school looking for applications of their technical skills, landing on an underserved market through research rather than pain. The idea didn't grow from a personal encounter with broken fish phenotyping. It was selected.

And yet the problem itself is exactly the kind of thing schlep blindness predicts would be under-attacked. Manually inspecting juvenile fish for deformities, five minutes per animal, in a wet hatchery facility -- this is so far from the consciousness of the average technical founder that it might as well be invisible. Nobody at a hackathon has ever said "let's fix fish phenotyping." The schlep is biological, physical, species-specific, and requires going to remote farm facilities to deploy cameras on production lines that handle live animals. That ugliness is precisely what keeps competition structurally low. So I'm left with an unusual tension: a genuine schlep problem discovered through the wrong mechanism. The problem is organic even if the founders' path to it isn't.

What partially redeems this is the Riverence pilot. A six-figure paid contract with the largest trout producer in the United States is not something you win from a pitch deck. Someone went to that hatchery, deployed cameras on a production line, demonstrated that their system could cut inspection time from five minutes to thirty seconds, and convinced a real fish farmer to write a real check. That's a version of doing things that don't scale. At pre-seed, with two founders still at CMU, landing enterprise revenue from the biggest player in your initial species -- that's the kind of signal that suggests these founders can sell into an industry they didn't grow up in. The grant and competition wins ($70K SICA, $20K McGinnis, $10K Ocean Exchange) reinforce the picture of founders who are hustling across every available channel to fund their work. They're not waiting for permission.

The bull case is straightforward: this is DoorDash in fish. DoorDash was bottom-half of their batch, working in a crowded category with no obvious schlep-blindness advantage. But Tony Xu went and delivered food himself. If Grech and Singh have been spending their weekends inside trout hatcheries, handling fish, talking to technicians, understanding why the manual process persists -- then the lack of prior aquaculture experience becomes less damning. Domain expertise can be acquired through obsessive immersion. The 10x improvement in inspection speed (5 minutes to 30 seconds) with 90-95% accuracy, if real at production scale, is the kind of concrete value proposition that sells itself. And the competitive landscape actually favors them in one important dimension: Aquaticode, their most direct competitor, has $6M and a 3M-image database but is focused on European salmon and bass markets. Tidal has massive data but operates downstream in grow-out pens, not hatcheries. OctaPulse may have a narrow window to own U.S. hatchery QA before either competitor pivots.

But the bear case is real. Aquaticode can scan 10,000 fish per hour with a 3M+ image database. Tidal has 30 billion data points across 50 million fish. OctaPulse has one customer and whatever dataset they've accumulated from a single trout deployment. The "proprietary multi-species dataset" moat they describe is aspirational -- right now it's a single-species dataset from one farm. Computer vision for biological inspection is not algorithmically novel; the barrier is labeled data, and their competitors have orders of magnitude more of it. If Aquaticode decides to enter the U.S. market or Tidal decides to move upstream into hatcheries, OctaPulse's thin data advantage evaporates. The founding team's lack of aquaculture credibility becomes a real liability when selling to a second and third farm that doesn't know them from CMU connections.

On the technical side, Singh's resume -- ASML, Toyota, Tesla, NVIDIA, now CMU robotics -- suggests he can build. They have a deployed, working system. But I don't see public code, open-source contributions, or the kind of hacker signals I look for when evaluating whether someone is "an animal" at their craft. The team follows the MBA-plus-engineer template, which is competent but not the hacker-founder archetype that built Stripe, Dropbox, or Reddit. Grech's Robotics Institute Pathways Fellowship shows he's not purely business-side, which helps, but the technical depth of the core ML system is hard to assess from available evidence.

This is a company I'd watch but not invest in today. The schlep is real and the early traction is encouraging, but the origin of the idea doesn't pass my organic test, the data moat is nascent against better-resourced competitors, and the founders haven't yet demonstrated the deep domain immersion that would compensate for their non-organic entry. If they come back in six months with three paying customers across two species and can describe the twelve things that went wrong at Riverence and how they fixed each one, that's a different conversation.
