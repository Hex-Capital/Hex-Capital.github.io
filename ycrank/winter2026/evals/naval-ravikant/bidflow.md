# Bidflow -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The pivot tells the story. Six months ago these founders were building QA agents for bug detection. Now they're counting electrical receptacles on data center blueprints. The contact email still says tryghostship.dev. Jesse Choe and Gautham Ramachandran are clearly talented -- USACO Platinum, Jane Street at 18, a company bootstrapped to $120K revenue at 16 -- but talent is the most common thing in Silicon Valley. The question I always ask first is: what do these founders know about electrical estimating that a different pair of brilliant engineers couldn't learn in six months? The answer, based on everything in this dossier, is nothing. Their specific knowledge is in competitive programming and machine learning. Those skills are genuine but they are also fully transferable -- any strong ML team could apply the same capabilities to the same problem. When I backed Evan Williams, his decade of obsession with public communication tools meant he understood something about human expression that couldn't be extracted from a textbook. Here, the founders discovered the electrical estimating problem through customer discovery, not through lived experience. That's a fundamentally different starting position.

The leverage architecture is real but unremarkable. An AI model that replaces manual symbol counting on blueprints is code-as-leverage applied to a specific workflow -- one model serving many estimators, 5x time reduction claimed by Bass Electric. This is genuine productivity multiplication. But it's the same leverage pattern as every AI vertical tool being built right now. Bidflow isn't creating a new form of leverage that didn't exist before -- it's applying existing computer vision capabilities to a workflow that happens to still be manual. Compare this to what Replit did: it didn't just make existing programmers faster, it turned non-programmers into programmers. That's a qualitative expansion of who can create. Bidflow makes existing estimators faster. Valuable, but linear in ambition.

The timing question is where this gets worse, not better. AI-powered construction takeoffs are consensus. Beam AI has $48M and 1,100 customers. Togal has $17.5M. Autodesk acquired ProEst. Every construction tech pitch deck in 2026 opens with "legacy tools, AI opportunity." This is exactly the pattern I warn against -- when twenty investors are competing for deals in a category, the asymmetric upside has already been priced into the competitive landscape. The electrical-specific specialization is a wedge, not a moat. Any of these well-funded competitors could hire two electrical engineers and build NECA integration in a quarter. The 83.5% accuracy is honest reporting, but a 1-in-6 error rate on a competitive bid where margins are thin is a product liability, not a selling point. And that benchmark is reachable by any team with access to modern vision models and a few hundred labeled electrical blueprints.

The strongest bull case: the data center boom is creating a genuine capacity crisis in electrical contracting. The underlying services market is $237 billion. If Bidflow's data flywheel works -- each correction improving the model, each customer's blueprints training domain-specific accuracy -- they could build a compounding advantage that generalist competitors can't match because they're spread across too many trades. Veeva proved that maniacal vertical focus can defeat horizontal platforms. And these founders' competitive programming backgrounds mean they can iterate on model architecture faster than construction companies can hire ML talent. If they stay focused on electrical for five years and accuracy compounds past 95%, the switching costs become real. That's a plausible path to a meaningful outcome.

But plausible isn't the same as compelling. The Veeva analogy actually undermines the case: Peter Gassner had been a senior engineering leader at Salesforce with deep pharma industry relationships before founding Veeva. Specific knowledge of the platform AND specific knowledge of the customer. Bidflow has neither -- no construction industry background and no prior relationship with the technology stack they're replacing. The founders are searching for a problem worthy of their technical skills, which is the exact pattern I flag as "more passionate about founding than about the specific problem." Two pivots and two failed prior startups for Gautham, a domain shift mid-YC-batch -- this reads as smart, energetic founders who haven't yet found their specific knowledge. I'd want to see them in three years, after they've accumulated non-teachable understanding of how electrical contractors actually think, bid, and win. Right now they're building a slightly better tool for a slightly smaller market within a category that everyone already agrees is ready for disruption. That's not where the asymmetric returns live.
