# Kyten Technologies -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment here is unusually concrete. Most "why now" narratives I hear involve gradual adoption curves or speculative demand shifts. Kyten's is codified in federal law: NDAA Section 842 prohibits DoD procurement of batteries from foreign entities of concern starting January 2028, and the FCC added all foreign-produced UAS battery components to its Covered List in December 2025 -- effective immediately for new equipment authorizations. This isn't a market that *might* open up. It's a market that *must* find domestic suppliers on a hard deadline. When I led Anduril's Series D, the catalyst was also structural -- Google's Project Maven cancellation created a defense AI vacuum. Here, Congress has created a battery supply chain vacuum by legislative mandate. That's a forcing function most software-focused angels don't know how to evaluate, which is exactly why I lean in: regulatory complexity as moat is one of my most consistent patterns across Color Health, Coinbase, and Anduril.

What makes me take this seriously at pre-seed is the founder-market fit specificity. These aren't adjacent-domain founders pivoting into batteries -- McBride and Maddox spent six to seven years at SpaceX Starlink deploying 5,000-6,000+ battery packs to low earth orbit, with McBride managing automated test infrastructure and then building Shield AI's hardware test team from zero to twenty people in under a year. The claim that Kyten can compress each phase -- design, qualification, production -- to roughly one week versus the legacy six-to-twelve months per phase maps directly to the SpaceX operational playbook: use software-defined manufacturing to collapse timelines that incumbents treat as fixed constraints. EaglePicher has powered 600+ satellites but its organizational structure is optimized for cadences measured in quarters, not weeks. If the speed claims hold, that's a genuine structural advantage, not an incremental improvement.

The "too boring" archetype applies cleanly. Custom aerospace battery pack integration is not the kind of company that generates buzz at demo day. It's not AI, it's not consumer, it's not even particularly photogenic. But it maps to the same pattern as PagerDuty and Gusto -- unglamorous infrastructure that every participant in a growing market absolutely needs. Over 100,000 drones, submarines, and satellites are being built annually in the US, and each one requires battery packs that must be designed, qualified, and manufactured domestically under the new regulatory regime. The market sizing ranges from $207 million to $10.4 billion depending on how broadly you define aerospace batteries, but the relevant number is the one that matters for pack-level integration in defense-adjacent verticals under NDAA compliance -- that's a segment growing both from underlying demand (UAV market heading to $2.41 billion by 2030) and from regulatory reshoring.

Where my conviction drops is the product-to-distribution trajectory. The best investments in my portfolio -- Stripe, Figma, Gusto -- all started with a product that became a distribution channel for additional products and revenue streams. Stripe's API created a developer relationship that distributed Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Kyten's initial product is custom battery packs built to spec. That's a manufacturing contract, not a platform wedge. Could it expand? Possibly -- BMS software, thermal management IP, testing services, ongoing monitoring -- but I see no evidence the founders have articulated that multi-product vision. Contract manufacturing for custom aerospace components can be a profitable business, but it's structurally different from a platform that compounds through distribution. This caps the upside case in ways that matter for a portfolio-return perspective.

The capital intensity concern is real but not disqualifying. Battery pack manufacturing requires facility buildout, equipment, and cell inventory. Five hundred thousand dollars from YC doesn't build a factory. But I've made peace with capital-intensive models when the structural moment is right -- Anduril required massive capital and I still led a $450 million round. The difference is stage: Anduril had proven traction when I invested at Series D. At pre-seed, Kyten has no independent company revenue, no public LOIs, and no completed qualifications under its own name. The "one week qualification" claim needs scrutiny -- MIL-STD-810 and DO-160 environmental testing protocols typically require months. If "one week" refers to internal screening rather than customer-accepted qualification, the actual sales cycle may still be measured in quarters, which changes the velocity story. I'd want to understand exactly what that speed claim covers before writing a check.

The bull case I keep coming back to: if you could identify the domestic contract manufacturer that captures even five percent of defense battery pack reshoring during the NDAA compliance window, with SpaceX-caliber manufacturing processes and founders who have literally shipped thousands of packs to orbit, that's an asymmetric bet. The regulatory catalyst creates demand on a fixed timeline regardless of market conditions. The founder expertise is directly relevant at scale. And incumbents like EaglePicher are being acquired by industrial conglomerates (Tuthill Corporation, October 2023), not exactly the profile that moves fast into a new production paradigm. If Kyten establishes qualification credentials with two or three defense OEMs during the 2026-2028 compliance window, switching costs lock in those relationships for years. That's a real business. My hesitation isn't about the opportunity -- it's about whether this specific company, at this specific stage, has the capital access and procurement relationships to capture it before better-funded competitors like CRG Defense do.
