# Remy AI -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing about warehouse robotics in 2026: it's not an insane idea. It's the opposite of insane. Dexterity is at $1.65 billion. Nimble hit unicorn status with FedEx as a strategic partner. Covariant built a foundation model and partnered with ABB. RightHand has Rockwell Automation. The market has spoken — nearly a billion dollars of venture capital has already validated that robots should pick and pack things in warehouses. When I look at Remy AI through my primary filter, I see two Oxford graduates pursuing what is arguably one of the most consensus ideas in industrial tech right now. That's not "sane person, insane idea." That's sane person, sane idea — which is the configuration that produces the worst risk-adjusted returns because you're buying into a narrative the market has already priced.

Ben Kaye's credentials are real. A DPhil in Oxford's Visual Geometry Group with a CVPR 2025 publication on 3D shape reconstruction — that's legitimate computer vision research from one of the world's best labs. Oscar Brisset's eighteen months at BCG X advising logistics companies gives some commercial context. But here's what concerns me about the founder-market fit: neither of them has built robots, deployed hardware in industrial environments, managed a manufacturing supply chain, or run warehouse operations. The gap between publishing a vision paper and shipping physical robots into demanding 24/7 warehouse environments is enormous. It's the gap between writing software and running a painting company — and I know from Craftwork exactly how brutal that operational translation is. The CTO's prior hardware experience is in medical devices at OrganOx, which is a different universe from warehouse-floor robotics. When I think about what made the Solana bet work, Anatoly Yakovenko had spent years as a systems engineer at Qualcomm building the exact type of low-level performance infrastructure that a high-throughput blockchain required. That directness of experience-to-problem mapping is missing here.

Now let me run the test that dominates my current framework: does this business get stronger or weaker as AI gets cheaper? This is where Remy AI faces a structural problem that I think most investors are glossing over. The company's core technical claim — a proprietary VLA training pipeline that requires less data than standard approaches — sits directly in the blast radius of the most well-resourced AI research efforts on the planet. Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics, Physical Intelligence's π0, Stanford's open-source OpenVLA — these are billion-dollar research programs attacking the exact same problem with orders of magnitude more compute and data. Unlike Craftwork, where the moat is the painting crews and the local operations and the scheduling complexity that no amount of AI can replicate from a server room, Remy AI's moat IS the AI. Strip out the VLA model and you have commodity robot hardware with no defensible position. As AI gets cheaper and more capable, every robotics company in the world gets access to better foundation models. That's the opposite of what I want — I want businesses where AI is the cherry on top, not the whole sundae.

The strongest bull case, and I want to be honest about it: 80% of US warehouses have zero automation. The incumbents who've raised hundreds of millions are structurally unable to serve these facilities because their unit economics, sales processes, and deployment models are built for large-scale operations. If Remy AI can genuinely deliver a brownfield system at 50% lower cost that slots into existing workstations, they could own a market segment the unicorns will never touch — the way a scrappy downmarket entrant sometimes captures the long tail that enterprise players consider beneath them. That's a legitimate disruptive positioning story. And the "why now" is real: VLA models have crossed a capability threshold in the last twelve months that makes generalist robotic manipulation feasible for the first time. If you squint, this has the structure of a Christensen disruption — simpler, cheaper, good enough for the underserved segment. But to believe that story, I need to believe two things I don't currently see evidence for: that the hardware can actually be manufactured and deployed at that price point (no manufacturing partners, no pilots, no deployments disclosed), and that the training pipeline advantage is durable against open-source alternatives backed by better-resourced labs.

On the primitive question — which is often where I find the most asymmetric upside — Remy AI is definitively application-layer. They're building robots that do specific tasks in specific environments. There's no protocol, no standard, no infrastructure layer that other companies build on. Each deployment is a linear sale, not a network node. Compare this to Helium, where every hotspot made the network more valuable for every other participant, or to Aleo, where the zero-knowledge protocol becomes infrastructure for an ecosystem of privacy-preserving applications. Remy AI doesn't have that compounding dynamic. The narrative can expand — "dexterous tasks in warehouses" could become "dexterous tasks everywhere" — but that expansion path leads directly into competition with Figure AI, Tesla Optimus, and every other humanoid robotics program. The narrative gets harder to own as it gets bigger, which is the opposite of an infinity story.

I'm passing. The founders have technical credibility but not the specific operational depth this problem demands, the idea is consensus in a market where a billion dollars has already been deployed, the technical moat sits in the most rapidly commoditizing layer of the AI stack, and there's no protocol-layer position or physical-world operational complexity creating the kind of structural defensibility I require. I'd rather fund the company that deploys someone else's robots and builds the messy operational layer around warehouse logistics than the company trying to out-research Google DeepMind on robotic foundation models with two people and a YC check.
