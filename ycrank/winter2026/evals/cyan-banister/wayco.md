# Wayco -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that catches my attention here isn't the product or the market — it's the structural ambition buried in the strategy. Wayco isn't just building software for law firms. It wants to *become* a law firm. That's the kind of move that makes me sit up, because it reminds me of how Affirm couldn't just build a better checkout widget — Affirm had to navigate financial regulation, become a lender, and participate directly in the economics of the transaction to create real transparency. When a startup says "we're going to enter the regulated structure ourselves," that either signals deep conviction or deep naivety, and at this stage I genuinely can't tell which one it is here. A 19-year-old from Tajikistan pursuing multi-state bar admission and referral fee compliance is either going to be the kind of story I love telling in five years or a cautionary tale about regulatory ambition outrunning domain expertise.

And that's where my framework starts to strain. When I evaluate founders, the first thing I want to hear is their story — not the pitch, the *story*. How did you get here? Why this problem? Iqbol Temirkhojaev's biographical arc is genuinely extraordinary: competitive coding at 11, a VC-backed company at 13, an acquisition by the United Nations at 14, a presidential medal at 16, all from Tajikistan — a country that has never produced a YC founder before. That's outsider energy I recognize in my bones. When you grow up in a place where nobody around you is building startups and you do it anyway, that forges something real. But here's what I keep looking for and can't find: the thread connecting this particular founder to this particular problem. His prior work was augmented reality education apps. There's no documented legal industry experience, no personal encounter with the brokenness of referral systems, no "I watched my mother try to find a lawyer and couldn't" moment. The grit is undeniable; the problem-founder fit is opaque. And for me, that distinction matters enormously — I backed Crusoe Energy because the founders had independently arrived at an insight grounded in real physics and real waste they'd observed firsthand, not because they were smart generalists who identified a market gap.

The category itself creates a tension in my framework. "AI for legal" is about as consensus as it gets right now — legal tech investment hit $2.4 billion in 2025, Harvey AI is valued north of $1.5 billion, and 79% of lawyers say they're adopting AI. That's the opposite of unpopular. The companies I've done best with — SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe — were investments that made people uncomfortable, that other investors actively dismissed. When I look at Wayco's investor list — Sequoia Scout Fund, seed investors from ElevenLabs and Groq — that's quality capital, but it's also a signal that this deal had consensus appeal. The specific niche of AI-powered referral networking is more differentiated than "AI legal research," and the strategy of becoming a licensed law firm is genuinely non-obvious, but the gravity of the broader category pulls this toward consensus territory.

What I find most interesting through my lens is the invisible-system angle. Legal referrals are deeply opaque — which lawyers a firm refers to depends on who they personally know, which creates geographic and relationship bottlenecks that hurt clients who happen to live in the wrong zip code or whose injury requires expertise their local attorney doesn't have connections for. If Wayco builds a functioning national referral network, it makes a genuinely invisible system visible, and that pattern — Carta for cap tables, Flock Safety for neighborhood safety data, Affirm for credit costs — is one where I've seen enormous value created. But the cold-start marketplace problem is real, and building network density market by market while simultaneously pursuing law firm licensure across states while being a solo founder with a team of one... that's not just ambitious, it's asking one person to solve three hard problems in parallel, each of which usually consumes an entire team.

The bull case I have to genuinely consider: if this founder's trajectory holds — and the trajectory from 11-year-old competitive coder in Tajikistan to UN-acquired software by 14 is unlike anything I've seen — then the lack of legal domain expertise might not matter. Some of the best companies are built by outsiders who see the industry's dysfunction precisely *because* they're not captured by its assumptions. And the "become a law firm" strategy, if executed, creates the kind of regulatory moat that pure-software competitors simply cannot replicate without making the same structural commitment. Voice AI hitting production quality right now creates a real timing window for automated intake. If Iqbol can hire the right legal domain experts and build network density in even one market, the referral fee economics ($5-6.5 billion annually in PI alone) are large enough to build something significant. But "if" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, and I've learned the hard way — from GameCrush, from HQ Trivia — that extraordinary ambition without the right team structure and domain grounding tends to end badly. I'd want to meet this founder, hear the story behind why legal referrals, and understand whether there's a biographical thread I'm missing before writing a check.
