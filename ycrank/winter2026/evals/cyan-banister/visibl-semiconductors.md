# Visibl Semiconductors -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Visibl: this is a two-person pre-seed company walking into a firefight. ChipAgents has raised $74 million and is already deployed at 80 semiconductor companies with 140x year-over-year ARR growth. Cognichip raised a $33 million seed from Lux Capital and Mayfield. Synopsys.ai already has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. Cadence just launched ChipStack AI Agent last month. And then there's Visibl -- two founders, no disclosed traction, no customers, entering a space where the consensus has already formed that AI will transform chip design. This isn't an unpopular idea that most investors are dismissing. This is a popular idea that well-capitalized teams are already executing on. That's a problem for how I invest.

When I think about the founders, I want to hear their stories -- not the business pitch. And what I see in the dossier gives me pause. Jordon Kashanchi has real semiconductor credentials. Working on Azure Maia at Microsoft, doing RTL design at ARM, interning at Intel -- that's a legitimate career in chip design and he clearly understands the pain of navigating EDA tool feedback across complex design cycles. He has the domain knowledge. But Bryce Neil, the CEO, comes from Deloitte's OmniaAI team -- software and data systems, not semiconductors. I don't see the biographical thread that connects him to this specific problem. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone would fund it. When I invested in Uber, Travis had this gravitas that came from years of thinking about why the taxi medallion system was broken. Here, I see a talented software engineer and a talented chip designer, but I don't see the kind of personal stake or biographical grit that tells me these are the inevitable people to solve this problem. Where's the story of hardship or obsession that would make me believe they'll persist through the brutal enterprise sales cycles and the competitor onslaught?

The competitive dynamics concern me at a structural level. My thesis is about finding the pocket of dreamers and misfits before it becomes consensus. AI for chip design became consensus in 2025 when hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the space. The standalone AI-native IDE approach -- building a new paradigm rather than layering onto Cadence and Synopsys -- is a mildly contrarian architectural bet, and I respect the instinct. It's similar to how Figma didn't try to be an Adobe plugin. But the category itself has been thoroughly de-risked and validated by other investors, which means the weirdness premium I look for isn't there. Nobody's going to call you crazy for building AI tools for chip design in 2026.

The strongest bull case I can construct is this: Kashanchi has seen the EDA pain up close at exactly the right companies -- Microsoft's custom AI silicon program is one of the most demanding chip design environments on the planet. If the architectural bet on a standalone IDE proves correct, and if incumbent-integration approaches like ChipAgents hit a ceiling because they're building on top of legacy paradigms that were never designed for agentic AI, then Visibl's ground-up approach could leapfrog everyone. The on-prem deployment model is smart for an industry with extreme IP sensitivity, and that creates switching costs once you're embedded. There's a version of this story where the right two people with the right architecture win even against better-funded competitors -- it's happened before. But for that story to work, I'd need to feel that jolt of conviction about the founders, and I'd need to see something nobody else sees. Right now, I see a well-understood opportunity in a well-funded category, and I don't have the biographical signal that tells me these founders will outlast and outmaneuver teams with 30x their resources.

I also notice there's nothing here about creating economic access or making invisible systems visible for people who lack it. This is enterprise software for well-compensated chip design engineers at semiconductor companies. It may help address the structural chip engineer shortage, and that has real downstream value, but it doesn't connect to the thread that runs through my best investments -- Uber creating income for drivers, Affirm giving transparent credit to people who couldn't get it, Postmates putting money in delivery workers' pockets. Finally, the co-founder relationship is opaque. No shared history, no common employer or university, no data on how they found each other or tested their working relationship. After HQ Trivia, I probe this dimension hard, and here I have nothing to work with.
