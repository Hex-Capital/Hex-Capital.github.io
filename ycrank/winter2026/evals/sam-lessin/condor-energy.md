# Condor Energy -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what I see immediately: Condor Energy is building an "AI-powered Energy OS" — dashboards, forecasting, hedging analytics, capex screening — sold as SaaS to large electricity consumers. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the individual components — energy dashboards, price forecasting, hedging analytics — are not technically unique" and that "commoditization risk is material." I don't even need to apply my framework to know this is structurally challenged. The company is building software tools in a category where AI makes every individual component cheaper to replicate every quarter. Voltus has $121M and $35M ARR in the adjacent space. Pexapark raised $41M on the sell side. Gridmatic raised $40M. This isn't a non-consensus opportunity — it's a well-funded, well-understood market category where multiple players are already building, and where incumbents like SAP and Schneider Electric have existing enterprise relationships with exactly the same customers Condor is targeting. When I ask my foundational question — is this a sane person with an insane idea? — the answer is sane person, sane idea, which is the worst combination for venture returns because the opportunity is already priced into the market.

The founders deserve genuine credit on the "sane" side of the equation. Florian Péroocheau was a power trader and worked at Voltalis — he's lived inside the machinery of European electricity markets. Jean and Clément worked on hydropower plants together before starting this. That's real domain depth, not theoretical proximity to a problem. The co-founder relationships also check out: Jean and Clément went through X-HEC Entrepreneurs together and worked on infrastructure side by side, then brought in Florian from the trading world. This isn't a speed-dating founding team. But founder credibility paired with a consensus thesis just means you've got a competent team in a crowded race — and crowded races at pre-seed are exactly where I lose money, because the "insane idea" premium has been arbitraged away before the company even ships.

Let me steelman the bull case, because there's a version of this that works. Energy procurement for large C&I buyers is genuinely complex — fragmented markets, volatile pricing from intermittent renewables, regulatory differences between European ISOs and US RTOs. If Condor becomes the system of record for how large enterprises manage their entire electricity portfolio, the switching costs could be real — not because the software is hard to replicate, but because ripping out embedded procurement workflows is operationally painful. The data compounding story has some logic: aggregating consumption patterns, hedging outcomes, and PPA performance across dozens of large customers creates a proprietary dataset that improves recommendations for every new customer. And the data center angle is legitimately interesting — AI infrastructure buildout is creating an entirely new class of enormous electricity buyer who needs sophisticated procurement tools yesterday. If Condor nails the data center vertical first and uses that as a wedge into broader C&I, there's a path. But for this bull case to work, Condor would need to win a category where well-funded competitors and entrenched energy consultants already operate, using a software product whose individual features are, by the dossier's own admission, not technically unique. That's a distribution fight, not an innovation fight — and distribution fights favor incumbents with existing enterprise relationships.

The structural problem I keep returning to is that this business fails my most basic filter: would it be defensible without the software layer? There's no physical-world operation here that software amplifies. There are no painting crews, no parking infrastructure, no hardware in the field. The software IS the product. When I invested in Craftwork, the insight was that AI could optimize scheduling and dispatch but couldn't replace the humans actually painting houses. Condor has no equivalent physical moat. Every component — dashboards, forecasting models, hedging simulations, NPV calculators — is exactly the kind of analytical tooling that gets commoditized as AI development costs collapse. A well-resourced energy trading desk or consultancy could build comparable analytics in months, not years, with current AI capabilities. And Condor isn't creating a new primitive or protocol — it's an application layer sitting on top of existing market data feeds, existing metering infrastructure, and existing PPA contract structures. Applications get absorbed. Primitives compound. Condor is firmly on the application side of that divide.

The narrative container of "Energy OS" has some elasticity — you can stretch it from procurement analytics to hedging execution to asset investment to eventually energy trading — but it's bounded by the fact that you're building a tool for a specific buyer persona (large electricity consumers). That's not an infinity story. Compare this to Helium, where "decentralized IoT wireless" could expand to encompass all wireless infrastructure globally, or Venmo, where peer-to-peer payments was a primitive that could underpin an entire financial ecosystem. "Make large companies' electricity bills 20% cheaper" is a valuable service, but it's a feature of enterprise resource management, not a new category. The ceiling is visible from seed.
