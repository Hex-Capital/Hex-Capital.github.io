# Lance -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the story before anything else does. Canary Technologies has raised $180 million at a $600 million valuation and already ships an AI Voice product to hotels. Duve raised $85 million. Akia, HiJiffy, and Viqal are building in the same space with the same thesis: hotels are understaffed, AI can answer calls and messages. When I see five or six funded companies converging on the same insight -- "hotels miss 40% of their calls and 65% have staffing gaps" -- I see a Girardian competition spiral, not an investment. Everyone in the room agrees on the diagnosis. Everyone is building the same solution. There is no secret here. The staffing crisis in hospitality is as widely discussed as the weather. The "AI for hotels" thesis is consensus dressed in contrarian clothing.

The Computer Use Agent approach -- where Lance's AI navigates hotel software UIs directly rather than requiring API integrations -- is the most interesting element of the company, and it is the closest thing to a genuine secret. Most enterprise software builders would argue that API integrations are the architecturally correct approach: more reliable, more maintainable, more scalable. Lance is betting that screen-navigation AI is faster to deploy and more flexible, which could create a deployment-speed advantage that lets them capture properties before integration-heavy competitors can finish implementation. If this bet is correct, it is a meaningful tactical edge. But it is not a secret in the sense I use the word. It is a technical bet on a capability that Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are all developing as general-purpose AI infrastructure. Any competitor -- including Canary with its $180 million war chest -- can adopt the same computer-use approach tomorrow. A deployment method built on someone else's foundation model capability is not proprietary technology. It is a feature that commoditizes as the underlying capability improves, and the underlying capability is improving rapidly.

The founders deserve credit for real execution. Fifty-plus hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt branded properties at the pre-seed stage is unusual traction. Caleb Chan was founding engineer at a company that achieved a nine-figure exit and built voice technology at Google and Salesforce. Gatik Trivedi founded and exited a company previously. These are not first-time operators fumbling through their first sales call. But competence is not conviction in the sense that matters to me. I see no evidence that these founders hold a singular, definite vision of how the hospitality industry fundamentally transforms -- no indication they would refuse an acquisition, no articulation of a world-historical thesis about what hotels become when autonomous agents fully replace human operations. The framing is operational efficiency: reduce call volume by 30%, recover restaurant booking revenue, replace walkie-talkies with tablets. These are incremental improvements to an existing industry, not a zero-to-one reimagining of how hospitality works. The future they are describing is a slightly more efficient version of today's hotel, not a structurally different one.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If Computer Use Agent technology proves dramatically more deployable than API-dependent competitors -- weeks instead of months -- Lance could build a meaningful installed base before Canary and Duve catch up in voice. The per-property workflow knowledge accumulated across 50+ hotels could become a data moat that makes their agents measurably better at property-specific tasks than any general-purpose entrant. Hotel management groups that deploy Lance across their entire portfolio would face real switching friction. And the voice-first positioning is genuinely differentiated against the text-only chatbot players: phone calls remain the primary guest communication channel, and most competitors have underinvested there. If Lance can lock in the major hotel groups on voice operations before anyone else, the expansion path into sales automation and operational dispatch could create a multi-product platform that is genuinely difficult to displace. That is a plausible scenario, and the traction suggests it is not purely hypothetical.

But plausible is not enough when the market structure is this competitive. The central problem remains: this is a sector where the largest player has 360 times Lance's likely capital, serves the same brands, and has already launched the same core capability. Canary can bundle AI Voice into its existing platform at near-zero marginal cost. The technology is not proprietary -- it depends on generally available LLM and computer-use capabilities that any well-resourced competitor can deploy. The switching costs in hospitality SaaS are moderate, not structural. And the problem being solved, while real and painful, is fundamentally about operational efficiency in a sector that has been technologically stagnant for decades -- this is not a zero-to-one creation of a new category, it is AI applied to an existing workflow. The endgame I can envision for Lance is acquisition by a larger hotel technology platform, not independent market dominance. Companies built to be acquired are companies that never achieved monopoly, and my portfolio is built on companies that refuse to be acquired because they see a future worth owning independently.
