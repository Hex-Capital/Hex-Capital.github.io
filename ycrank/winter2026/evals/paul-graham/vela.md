# Vela -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is how the founders found the problem. With Vela, I can't find the answer. Gobhanu came from BCG AI. Saatvik came from AWS ML Supercompute and Perplexity. Neither has worked as a recruiter, an executive assistant, or a scheduling coordinator. Neither appears to have spent years drowning in the back-and-forth of multi-party calendar negotiation. The problem they're solving is real -- anyone who's tried to schedule a five-person panel interview across three time zones knows that. But the path from "we're AI engineers" to "we'll build an AI scheduling agent" looks like category selection, not organic discovery. This is the pattern I've warned about repeatedly: smart people who decided to start a startup first and then went looking for a problem to apply their skills to. The idea could have been generated by anyone reading a market report on AI assistants.

The schlep here worries me in a different way -- not because it's too large, but because it's too small. Compare this to Stripe. Payments involved dealing with banks, fraud detection, PCI compliance, money transmission licenses across fifty states, and the institutional inertia of an industry that hadn't innovated in decades. The schlep was so ugly that thousands of programmers who understood the problem unconsciously avoided it for a decade. With Vela, the schlep is multi-channel API integration: connecting to email, SMS, WhatsApp, and phone. That's engineering work, not institutional trench warfare. Any competent team with access to GPT-4 or Claude and a few months can build a conversational scheduling agent. When the barrier to replication is "spend some time on API integrations and prompt engineering," you don't have a moat -- you have a head start, and head starts in software get erased quickly. Calendly has $352 million in funding and a $3 billion valuation. Google owns both the calendar and the LLM. Microsoft owns Outlook and has deep Copilot integration. These incumbents aren't schlep-blind; they're watching this exact category.

The bull case rests on the brothers themselves, and it's not nothing. Gobhanu and Saatvik co-founded SWIFTmfi as teenagers -- ages roughly 14 and 16 -- and scaled it to 77 countries, disbursing $400K in microloans to over 3,200 women. That's not a school project. Operating a microfinance organization across dozens of countries as a teenager requires genuine operational intensity and the kind of coordination skills that would directly translate to building a multi-channel scheduling platform. Saatvik's technical credentials are strong: dual CS degree at Carnegie Mellon completed in two years with highest honors, AWS ML Supercompute, Perplexity. He dropped out of Booth to build Vela, which shows conviction. And the co-founder relationship is the opposite of my red flag -- these are brothers who've been building together for seven years, not strangers who met at a co-founder matching event. If I could somehow inject an organic problem backstory into this team, the picture would look different.

But I can't. And the competitive landscape makes the organic question more important, not less. This isn't a market where determination alone wins. Five funded competitors are already listed in the dossier, two were acquired in 2024, and the category "AI scheduling assistant" is exactly the kind of consensus AI application that every large platform company is eyeing. My observation that the most impressive recent YC companies aren't working on AI wasn't random -- it reflects the reality that when every smart person converges on the same category simultaneously, the odds for any individual startup drop. Vela needs to be significantly better than what Calendly, Google, or Microsoft could ship as a feature update, and the dossier provides no evidence of a technical or data advantage that would sustain that gap.

The user pull evidence is thin even by pre-seed standards. The YC page says Vela "is already used by professionals with the most complicated scheduling workflows" and references enterprise recruiters and large sales teams -- but with no customer names, no user counts, no revenue figures, and no organic adoption stories. I've seen plenty of YC applications where the marketing copy says "enterprise customers" and the reality is three friends trying it out. I don't know that's the case here, but the absence of any concrete traction signal -- even a single named customer or a specific usage number -- means I'm being asked to invest on team credentials and market thesis alone.

The team is impressive. The idea is competent. But competent ideas in hot categories from founders without domain-specific pain is not how the best companies start. This needed to begin with someone who spent two years as a recruiting coordinator at a 500-person company and couldn't believe that scheduling twelve panel interviews a day was still manual. Instead it begins with "we're good at AI and scheduling is a big market." That's the difference between Stripe and a payments startup.
