# Oximy -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me start with what jumps out immediately: the dossier itself states that Oximy's core technology -- monitoring desktop and browser activity and classifying AI tool interactions -- is "not technically unique." That's not my inference. That's the company's own competitive analysis. When the technology underlying a startup can be described by its own dossier as replicable with engineering investment, I know I'm looking at a company that has optimized for probability of success at the direct expense of consequence magnitude. Oximy is building a dashboard for a problem that CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, and every browser security vendor could add as a feature toggle in a quarterly release. The 3,500+ AI tool detection library is a classification database, not a technology moat. It's the kind of advantage that evaporates the moment a larger player assigns twenty engineers to the problem for six months.

The consequence of Oximy succeeding completely -- capturing dominant market share in AI usage governance -- is that enterprises have better visibility into which AI tools their employees use and what they spend on subscriptions. Nobody's life changes. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. No physical reality is altered. This is an analytics dashboard for CISOs and CFOs who need to check a compliance box. Compare this to what I funded at Commonwealth Fusion Systems, where success means replacing fossil fuel power generation entirely, or even Square, where success meant making the traditional point-of-sale infrastructure economically irrelevant. Oximy's success scenario is a profitable enterprise SaaS business -- respectable, sure, but the kind of outcome I specifically avoid because the effort-to-impact ratio doesn't justify the attempt for my portfolio construction.

The strongest argument for Oximy is timing, and I want to engage with it honestly. Shadow AI is a real, acute, board-level problem that barely existed twenty-four months ago. The EU AI Act creates genuine compliance mandates. The projected 39% CAGR for the enterprise AI governance market reflects a structural shift in regulatory pressure. If Oximy became the Salesforce of AI governance -- the system of record that every enterprise needed to demonstrate compliance -- the $68 billion 2035 TAM projection would make this a significant company. Naman's execution velocity is real: a repeat investor backed him twice, he achieved SOC 2 and HIPAA compliance at his prior startup, and his time at Induced AI gave him direct exposure to the enterprise AI ecosystem. The events-and-partnerships GTM motion targeting CISOs and CFOs is the right playbook for this category. I can see how a disciplined enterprise SaaS investor would find this compelling.

But I'm not a disciplined enterprise SaaS investor. I'm looking for whether this company, at full scale, makes the incumbent approach to anything structurally unviable. It doesn't. SaaS management incumbents like Zylo and Productiv can bolt on AI-specific modules. Harmonic Security already has $26 million and analyzes prompts at a deeper level. Noma Security has $132 million. The competitive landscape isn't a bunch of dismissive incumbents laughing at the idea -- it's a crowded field of well-funded companies all converging on the same problem from different angles. When Cisco's CTO told me they'd never build a TCP/IP router, that was a signal. When every enterprise security vendor is actively building AI governance features, that's the opposite signal. The experts aren't dismissing this market; they're stampeding into it. That means the premium goes to execution and distribution, not to the kind of technology discontinuity I invest around.

Naman is building his second real company, with prior experience in compliance-heavy enterprise SaaS and hands-on AI development. That's a reasonable founder profile for an enterprise tool. But there's nothing contrarian about the thesis. Shadow AI governance is consensus wisdom in enterprise security circles. The approach -- deploy a desktop agent, classify tools, generate compliance reports -- is what any competent team would build. There's no outsider insight here, no first-principles rethinking of how AI governance should work, no "everyone thinks this is crazy" energy. This is a capable founder executing a playbook that the market already validates, which is exactly the profile I find least interesting. The solo founder structure with a five-person team competing against companies with fifty to a hundred employees in an enterprise sales cycle adds structural risk without commensurate structural advantage.

I pass. The problem is real, the timing is favorable, and the founder appears competent. But this is an enterprise workflow tool in a market where well-funded competitors already exist and where the underlying technology has no defensible discontinuity. Oximy has reduced its risk of failure to the point where the upside case is a modest enterprise SaaS business, not a transformation of anything.
