# CatchBack Cards -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything I need to know before I examine anything else. Whatnot is valued at $11.5 billion. DOPA claims over 100,000 daily users in Japan and is now entering the U.S. market. TCGplayer was acquired by eBay for $295 million and processes three-quarters of a billion dollars annually. Alt raised $31 million. Dibbs got Amazon's backing. This is not a market waiting to be created -- it is a market where multiple well-capitalized players are already fighting over the same collectors, the same card inventory, and the same transaction fees. When I see five funded companies pursuing variations on the same thesis -- that collectors want better digital platforms for trading cards -- I see mimetic competition at its most transparent. Everyone has noticed that trading cards are a large market. That observation is not a secret; it is a consensus.

The thesis CatchBack articulates -- that cryptographic verification of mystery pack randomness will become the trust standard for collectors -- is a reasonable product insight but fails my test for a genuine contrarian truth. Ask any technically literate collector whether they would prefer provably fair randomness over trusting a seller's word, and they will say yes. The insight is obvious, not contrarian. More problematically, the founders have open-sourced the verification code. This is positioned as a trust-building measure, and it is -- but it simultaneously destroys any proprietary technology moat. They have published the recipe. When Whatnot or DOPA decides to add cryptographic verification to their platforms -- and with $11.5 billion and 100,000 daily users respectively, they can afford to hire the engineers to do it -- CatchBack's core differentiator becomes a commodity feature. Palantir's data fusion technology took years to build and was deeply integrated into government workflows before anyone could replicate it. CatchBack has open-sourced its core innovation four weeks after launch.

The founder profile presents a mixed signal. Joseph Zhang has genuine technical depth -- Stanford CS with an AI track, engineering at AWS and Nexus, McKinsey analytical training. The fact that he worked at Nexus, the very blockchain infrastructure CatchBack uses, means he understands the verification layer intimately. His personal connection to the space -- reportedly quitting his job to sell Pokemon cards -- suggests authentic domain immersion. But I see no evidence of the kind of definite, civilizational vision that distinguishes the founders I back. "Quit my job to sell Pokemon cards" is a lifestyle decision, not a thesis about the future. Zuckerberg could articulate precisely what the world would look like if Facebook succeeded. Musk designed the physics of reusable rocketry from first principles. Where is Zhang's equivalent declaration of what the trading card market becomes when CatchBack wins? The co-founder situation compounds the concern: Sophia Kim's background is entirely absent from public sources. A two-person pre-seed company where only one founder is visible is not inherently disqualifying, but it prevents me from assessing whether the team has the breadth of capabilities this business requires -- inventory management, pricing algorithms, regulatory navigation, and consumer brand building simultaneously.

The strongest bull case would require several things to be true simultaneously. First, that the custom pack creation mechanic -- users designing their own mystery packs with personalized chase cards and odds -- generates a user-generated-content flywheel that transforms CatchBack from a marketplace into a social platform. If pack creation becomes a form of self-expression and sharing packs becomes viral on TikTok, then network effects could emerge that are structurally different from what Whatnot or DOPA offer. Second, that the Steph Curry collaboration unlocks a distribution channel that accelerates past DOPA's U.S. expansion. Third, that the guaranteed buyback mechanism creates a pricing data advantage over time -- if CatchBack processes enough transactions, it could build the definitive pricing oracle for trading cards, which becomes a moat in itself. The $13,000 MRR with 700 users four weeks after launch is legitimately impressive for a consumer product at pre-seed. If that growth rate sustains, the unit economics could work. But "if the growth rate sustains" is precisely the kind of indefinite optimism I find structurally unpersuasive. A plan cannot be "we'll grow fast and figure it out." The question is whether there is a structural reason this company wins, and I cannot identify one.

The business model also carries a discomfort I cannot ignore. Mystery packs with customizable odds, real-money deposits, instant buyback -- this sits uncomfortably close to gambling mechanics dressed in collectibles language. The 18+ age rating on the App Store suggests the founders recognize this exposure. Belgium has already banned loot boxes. The FTC has scrutinized mystery box sellers. State gambling regulators are becoming more aggressive. A company whose core mechanic could be reclassified as gambling by regulators in any of fifty states does not have the kind of durable, defensible position I look for. Regulatory risk is tolerable when the underlying business has monopoly characteristics -- Palantir navigated government procurement complexity because its technology was irreplaceable. CatchBack's verification feature, while nice, does not make the platform irreplaceable to anyone.

This is a 1-to-n company in a competitive market. The technology is a feature, not a discontinuity. The thesis is consensus, not contrarian. The open-sourcing of the core innovation prevents monopoly. The competitive landscape is precisely the kind of multi-player mimetic contest I have spent my career avoiding. I pass.
