# Origin -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Origin is the path these founders took to get here. Yash Rathod's previous company was Diginoor -- described as India's first NFT marketplace. Now he's building AI-generated regulatory DNA for gene therapy. That's not a pivot driven by biography; that's a pivot driven by opportunity scanning. When I sit down with a founder, I want to hear the story that makes their company inevitable -- the personal thread that means *this* person had to solve *this* problem. I don't see that thread here. Malhar Bhide has more healthcare adjacency through his high school disease modeling publication and his work at Wadhwani AI, but published ML research across health domains is a skill set, not a calling. These are talented young engineers who identified a high-impact application for their machine learning capabilities. That's a perfectly rational way to start a company, but it's not the signal that gets me out of my chair.

The broader category concern reinforces my hesitation. AI-powered drug discovery and biotech enabling platforms are among the most popular investment themes in Silicon Valley right now. That's the opposite of what I look for. The most promising companies are ones that other investors find confusing or dismiss outright. Origin's specific niche -- de novo generative design of synthetic regulatory DNA elements -- is narrower and more technical than the typical AI-bio pitch, and I'll give credit for that specificity. But when your YC launch page prominently claims you outperform Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome, you're positioning yourself squarely inside the AI hype cycle, not outside it. Every biotech AI company right now is claiming to outperform some foundation model. The claim is unverified by any independent benchmark, and academic groups published generative AI methods for synthetic regulatory DNA in Nature Genetics just last year. This doesn't feel like a contrarian pocket of dreamers -- it feels like a well-positioned entry into a competitive and increasingly crowded space.

Let me engage seriously with the bull case, because there are real things to like. The advisory board -- Manolis Kellis at MIT/Broad, Nicole Paulk at UCSF, Rashid Bashir at UIUC -- is genuinely outstanding for a pre-seed company. If Axis does what Origin claims and they successfully build the largest proprietary dataset of validated synthetic regulatory sequences, the data flywheel could create a meaningful moat. The gene therapy market is expanding rapidly, pharma companies genuinely need better regulatory element design tools, and the specific competitors are either targeting different molecular layers (Dyno does capsids, Tessera does genome writing) or are so broadly scoped (Asimov at $205M+) that a focused startup could carve out the enabling-technology niche. The "why now" is legitimate -- foundation models for genomics crossed a capability threshold that makes this approach newly feasible. If you believe these founders have the raw ML talent to stay ahead of both well-funded competitors and open-source academic work, and that the advisory board fills the domain expertise gap, this could work. That's a lot of "ifs," but it's not an unreasonable bet for someone whose evaluation framework prioritizes technical differentiation.

My framework just isn't built for that kind of bet. I'm looking for the biographical inevitability, the lived experience that makes the founder unstoppable when things get hard -- and in biotech enabling technology, things always get hard. The path from computational prediction to wet-lab validation to pharma partnership to actual clinical impact is years long, and the founders who survive that journey are the ones solving a problem that's personal to them. I also don't see the economic access dimension that animates my best investments. Gene therapies are among the most expensive treatments on the planet -- safer gene therapies are genuinely important, but this isn't Uber creating income for drivers or Affirm making credit transparent for people who were shut out. The impact chain is real but extremely indirect and distant.

The co-founder dynamic is a neutral signal -- both from UIUC CS, likely met through academic networks, no evidence of prior working together through adversity. I don't see warning signs, but I also don't see the stress-tested relationship that gives me confidence for the long journey ahead. Malhar's connection to the PM Modi AI roundtable and his mother's position as Maharashtra Additional Chief Secretary suggest a well-connected background, which is fine, but it's the opposite of the outsider founder pattern that typically catches my eye.
