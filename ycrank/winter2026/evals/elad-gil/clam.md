# Clam -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most interesting signal here isn't about Clam itself -- it's the competitive landscape surrounding it. In 2025, three of the most prominent AI security startups were acquired within months: Protect AI by Palo Alto Networks for $500M+, Lakera by Check Point, CalypsoAI by F5 for $180M. That wave simultaneously validates enterprise demand for AI security and reveals something important about market structure: the incumbents bought broad AI governance platforms, not agentic deployment security specifically. A bull case for Clam would argue this acquisition wave created a structural vacancy -- the independents are gone, and the acquirers are integrating governance layers while the actual attack surface is shifting to autonomous agents with system access. It's the kind of gap I've seen create openings before. But when I test this thesis more carefully, I don't think the gap is durable. Network-level scanning of agent traffic is a well-understood cybersecurity pattern. Palo Alto Networks and Check Point have decades of experience building exactly this kind of network-level interception. The moment agentic AI deployments reach enterprise scale, these incumbents will extend their acquired platforms to cover the agent-specific attack surface. The gap Clam is targeting is real today but structurally temporary.

My core concern is that "AI agent security" is becoming a consensus category, not a non-obvious one. When an investor looks at Clam and says "AI agents need security," every cybersecurity company and enterprise buyer in the world is having that same conversation. Compare this to PagerDuty, which addressed operations alerting when most investors thought it was a niche developer tool -- nobody was rushing into that market. Or Gusto, where "payroll software for SMBs" triggered dismissive reactions from investors who wanted sexier categories. AI security is the opposite: it's the hot category that every cybersecurity vendor, every cloud provider, and every enterprise security team is actively pursuing. The agentic-specific focus within AI security adds a modest degree of non-obviousness, but it's a narrow differentiation within an otherwise consensus market. The $22.4 billion TAM cited in the dossier isn't a hidden market waiting to be discovered -- it's a market that just attracted $800M+ in acquisitions in a single year.

The commoditization risk is what keeps me from getting more excited. The individual scanning capabilities -- PII detection, prompt injection detection, malicious code scanning -- are available as open-source libraries and cloud APIs. Lakera Guard offers a free prompt injection API. NVIDIA's NeMo Guardrails is open-source. Amazon Bedrock has built-in guardrails. The "Semantic Firewall" combines these into a network-level wrapper, but that combination is architecturally straightforward for any competent security engineering team to replicate. This is where the "software-driven vs. software-aware" distinction matters most. A software-driven company creates compounding advantages that grow with usage -- Stripe's API integration becomes more valuable as developers build more products on it. Clam's network-level scanning doesn't obviously compound in the same way. The dossier mentions that seeing all agent traffic could create a data advantage over time, but that requires reaching sufficient scale first -- and scale requires winning against commoditized alternatives. That's two sequential dependencies, not a single clear miracle.

The platform dependency on OpenClaw concerns me structurally. Current messaging is "Run OpenClaw Securely in Minutes" -- that's being a feature for someone else's platform, not building your own distribution channel. If OpenClaw adds native security capabilities, or if a different agentic framework wins the adoption race, Clam's positioning narrows dramatically. Compare this to how Stripe positioned itself: payment infrastructure that worked with any web framework, not "payments for Ruby on Rails." The product-to-distribution trajectory is limited when your entire positioning is coupled to one upstream framework. I don't see evidence the founders have articulated how this initial wedge becomes a channel for additional products or revenue streams -- no multi-product vision, no expansion into adjacent capabilities like compliance, observability, or cost management for agentic workloads.

The bull case I'd want to be true: (1) the agentic AI deployment pattern becomes the dominant way enterprises use AI within 18 months, creating massive new infrastructure demand; (2) the managed VM approach with credential injection becomes sticky enough to create real switching costs; (3) Clam expands beyond OpenClaw to become the security layer for all agentic frameworks; and (4) the team's directly relevant experience -- Anshul as founding engineer at HappyRobot (YC, $500M valuation), Vaibhav building agent orchestration at Augment Code ($977M valuation) -- gives them an execution edge in understanding what agent security actually requires at the infrastructure level. That founder-market fit is the strongest signal in the dossier. Both founders built AI agent systems at near-unicorn companies and met through a Computer Security course at Berkeley. If I could see evidence that their product already handles attack patterns that generic scanning tools miss -- proprietary detection models trained on agent-specific threat vectors -- I'd weight the defensibility story differently. But that evidence isn't in the dossier, and without it, the bull case requires multiple things to go right simultaneously: framework expansion, defensibility through data accumulation, and outrunning well-resourced incumbents. That's more miracles than I'm comfortable with.

The founders have the right background for this problem, and the timing on the agentic AI shift is genuinely interesting. But the market is consensus-hot, the core technology is commoditized, the product is a single-purpose wrapper without clear platform expansion, and the positioning is coupled to one upstream framework. I've seen this pattern before -- a security layer built for the hot new category -- and the outcome is usually either acquisition for a modest multiple or commoditization into the platform itself. This doesn't match the structural characteristics of my best investments.
