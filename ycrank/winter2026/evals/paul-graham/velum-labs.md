# Velum Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is that Velum's own website can't decide what Velum is. "The ontology engine for enterprise AI" on one page. "Open-source firewall for content-level access control" on the YC listing. "The Dynamic Data Firewall for your Unstructured Data" on the blog. When a company describes itself three different ways, that's usually not a branding problem. It's a thinking problem. The founders haven't yet crystallized what they're actually building, which suggests the idea is still in search of its shape. That's not fatal at pre-seed — lots of great companies started fuzzy — but combined with the absence of any organic origin story, it raises the question I always ask first: did these founders discover a problem, or did they go looking for one?

Nothing in the dossier tells me how Benjamin or Alen personally encountered the pain of sensitive data leaking through AI workflows. Alen built ML platforms at Dataroot, which could plausibly have exposed him to data governance issues, and his pinned GitHub repo "ontology" suggests he was already thinking about semantic data modeling before Velum existed. That's a thread I'd pull on. But the public evidence reads more like "two smart ML people noticed AI security is a hot market" than "we kept running into this specific problem and finally decided to solve it." AI security is one of the most consensus-hot categories in tech right now — there are specialized market research reports, billion-dollar acquisition prices, and every VC's investment thesis mentions it. When I wrote about how the best startup ideas come from organic discovery, I was specifically warning against this pattern: a category that's so obviously important that smart people gravitate toward it through market analysis rather than personal necessity.

The schlep here is real, and that's the part that pulls me forward. Content-level access control across heterogeneous enterprise systems — SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, Workday — is genuinely ugly work. It requires understanding dozens of different data schemas, building integrations that handle the messy reality of enterprise data, navigating compliance frameworks across regulated industries. Most AI security startups are grabbing the clean end of the stick: prompt injection detection, model governance dashboards, monitoring tools. Content-level redaction across the full enterprise stack is the dirty work. That's exactly the kind of problem where schlep blindness operates — everyone can see it needs solving, but nobody wants to do the actual integration work. If Velum were founded by someone who'd spent five years as a data governance engineer at a hospital system or a bank, watching sensitive data leak through every new AI tool their employer adopted, I'd be significantly more interested.

The bull case would require believing two things. First, that the competitive consolidation happening right now — Check Point swallowing Lakera, Veeam absorbing Securiti — creates a genuine gap for a focused, open-source alternative that isn't locked into one vendor's ecosystem. That's plausible. Big acquirers tend to turn sharp products into features buried inside platforms, and enterprise buyers sometimes prefer independent tools. Second, that Alen's technical depth — CalHacks overall winner, 599 GitHub stars across 77 repos, principal engineering at an ML platform, research spanning protein folding to topological neural networks — represents the kind of hacker-builder who can execute faster than well-funded competitors can copy. That's also plausible. He has the profile of someone who builds things compulsively. If these two things are true, and if the founders' positioning confusion resolves quickly into something crisp, this could work.

But I can't get past the absence of organic discovery and the consensus nature of the category. The website claims support for 50+ enterprise systems and SOC 2 Type II certification for a two-person team that's still recruiting design partners. Those claims are aspirational at best, misleading at worst, and either way they signal a founder mindset oriented toward presenting rather than building. The open-source strategy — which should be their primary distribution advantage — has no visible public repository with any community traction. If you're an open-source company, your GitHub repo is your product. Where is it? And the competitive dynamics are brutal: Noma Security has $132 million and claims 1,300% ARR growth. You don't fight that with $500K unless you have something they fundamentally cannot build, and content-level redaction with NLP and policy engines is reproducible with enough engineering resources.

I'm passing. The schlep is real but the founders didn't find it organically. The technical CTO is genuinely strong but the idea feels assembled from market opportunity rather than lived experience. When the problem is this obvious and the market is this hot, the only advantage a tiny team has is that they understand something nobody else does — and I don't see evidence of that proprietary insight here.
