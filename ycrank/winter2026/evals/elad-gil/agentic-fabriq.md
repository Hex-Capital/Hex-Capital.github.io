# Agentic Fabriq -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most striking thing about Agentic Fabriq is not the product or the team -- it's the competitive landscape they're walking into. Oasis Security has $75M. Astrix Security has $85M. CrowdStrike just acquired SGNL for $740M in January 2026. Okta shipped Auth for GenAI to general availability in October 2025 and launched its Cross App Access protocol the month before. Microsoft is blogging about agent over-permissioning as a first-party security concern. This is a 2-person team with $500K entering a market where the category leader has already shipped the product, well-funded startups have raised over $200M collectively, and one competitor just got acquired for three-quarters of a billion dollars. When I apply my "market-ending moves" framework, the question I ask is: has the distribution leader already moved decisively enough that the structural window for a new entrant is closing? Okta has distribution to the exact buyer persona -- IT admins and security teams -- that Agentic Fabriq needs to reach. That's not a theoretical threat; it's a shipped feature set with an existing customer base.

The structural moment underlying this market is genuine. Agent proliferation in the enterprise is real -- the jump from less than 5% of enterprise applications featuring embedded agents in early 2025 to a projected 40% by 2026 is exactly the kind of adoption curve inflection I track. Agents operating on behalf of employees with delegated tool access creates a permission scoping problem that legacy IAM architectures weren't designed to handle. The "why now" is legitimate. But here's the problem: it's obvious to everyone. This is not a "too boring" or "too niche" market that other investors are overlooking -- it is among the most consensus categories in enterprise security right now. When I invested in PagerDuty, other investors were dismissing operations alerting as a boring niche. When I backed Gusto, payroll software seemed unsexy. The asymmetric returns in my portfolio come from markets where other investors can't see the scale. Agent identity and permissions is a market where every security vendor on the planet can see the scale. A consensus-hot market with this many well-capitalized competitors is the exact opposite of where my framework finds non-obvious returns.

The "Okta for Agents" positioning actually concerns me for a specific reason: it tells the incumbent exactly what to build. When Stripe emerged as "developer payments infrastructure," PayPal was architecturally unable to retrofit a developer-first API model -- the integration paradigm was fundamentally different. The bull case for Agentic Fabriq is that Okta's human-centric directory and SSO architecture similarly can't be retrofitted for per-employee agent permission scoping without a ground-up rebuild. If the data model for "which agent can access which tool on behalf of which employee at which clearance level" is genuinely architecturally incompatible with Okta's existing identity graph, then purpose-built wins. That's a real argument, and if it's true, this could be a meaningful company. But I don't have evidence that this architectural gap exists at the level required. The dossier itself notes that the underlying components -- OAuth delegation, policy engines, audit logging -- are "well-understood building blocks that multiple teams could assemble." The differentiation is a framing choice ("employee-scoped agent permissions" vs. "non-human identity management"), not a technical architecture that's hard to replicate. Framing is a marketing advantage, not a moat.

On the founders: Paulina and Matthew Xu are MIT dropouts with ML research backgrounds from serious labs (CSAIL, Kavli Institute, Haystack Observatory). That's a quality signal for technical capability, and YC F25 admission confirms it. But enterprise security infrastructure requires a different kind of founder-market fit than ML research provides. The buyer is a CISO or IT security lead who cares about compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001), audit guarantees, and integration reliability. No evidence of enterprise security experience, prior startup execution, or shipped product was found. No GitHub repos, no customer names, no revenue signals. Against competitors with Fortune 500 customer bases (Astrix has Figma, NetApp, Priceline, Workday) and teams that have already navigated enterprise sales cycles, the execution gap is substantial -- and it's not the kind of gap that raw technical talent alone closes.

The product-to-distribution trajectory has theoretical promise. If you own the agent permission layer, you could expand into agent monitoring, governance, and compliance -- the way Okta expanded from SSO into lifecycle management and identity governance. That platform expansion path is real. But the initial wedge has to be differentiated enough to build the customer base from which you distribute additional products. "Purpose-built agent permissions" versus "Okta's agent auth add-on" is a feature differentiation, not a distribution advantage. I need to see that the company is building something that creates compounding switching costs from day one -- per-employee permission policies that become entrenched in compliance workflows, connector integrations that create maintenance dependencies, audit logs that become the system of record. Those moats are theoretically available but none are proven.

I'm passing. The structural need is real, and if this team can somehow outrun Okta's feature velocity and the $200M+ already deployed by competitors, the market is enormous. But my framework requires that the market be non-obvious -- that the inflection be visible to me but not yet to the consensus. This inflection is visible to literally everyone in enterprise software. When I see a CrowdStrike $740M acquisition and Okta GA product launch in the same quarter that a pre-seed startup enters the category, the structural window analysis doesn't favor the new entrant. The founders need a miracle that's within their control -- a technical architecture or distribution insight that competitors can't replicate -- and I don't see evidence of one.
