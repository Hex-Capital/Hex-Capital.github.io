# Ruma Care -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Ruma Care: it's a sane person with a sane idea. Meng Fei Shen literally worked as a Medical Assistant at a rheumatology infusion clinic, watching staff drown in 70+ payer portals and eating $2,000-$8,000 losses on every denied biologic infusion. She lived inside this pain. Christina Huang built ML systems at Apple and led healthcare integrations at Medallion. These are credible operators with genuine domain knowledge. That's the sane part. But "let's use AI to automate prior authorization paperwork" is not an insane idea -- it's one of the most consensus healthcare automation plays in existence. CoverMyMeds was acquired for $1.1 billion doing this in 2017. Cohere Health has raised $200 million. Infinitus Systems has $103 million from a16z. Waystar is a public company with over a billion in revenue. When I count five well-capitalized competitors in the dossier and the idea still sounds obvious, I'm not looking at a non-consensus bet -- I'm looking at a crowded market where the "insane idea" premium has been fully arbitraged.

The AI kill test is where this really breaks down for me. The dossier itself acknowledges it: "the core technology (LLM-based form extraction, criteria matching, and form-filling) is technically reproducible." This is the exact category of software I've been arguing will get commoditized -- LLM-powered workflow automation where the AI IS the product, not the cherry on top. Every EHR vendor, every RCM platform, every one of those five competitors can ship biologics-specific form-filling the moment it becomes commercially interesting enough. The denial-pattern data flywheel is the best counterargument, but CoverMyMeds processes orders of magnitude more authorization volume than a two-person startup in California and Nevada. Cohere Health handles 12 million-plus PA requests annually. You don't win a data accumulation race when you're starting at zero against incumbents with established network effects.

The biologics niche deserves genuine engagement because it's the strongest element of the thesis. Buy-and-bill creates extreme financial exposure -- practices are absorbing $720K to $4.8M in annual at-risk revenue from denials. That's real pain with real willingness to pay. And the medication-diagnosis-payer matrix for biologics is genuinely complex in ways that broad-platform incumbents might deprioritize. If Ruma Care could become the definitive biologics authorization infrastructure -- the layer that every infusion clinic integrates with, that accumulates proprietary payer-specific criteria mappings no one else has -- there's a version of this that looks like a new primitive for specialty medication access. The 50% denial rate reduction, if real and sustained, is a powerful number. But I keep coming back to the structural question: is this a painting company with a tech layer, or a tech company with a paint layer? Infusion clinics have physical operations, but Ruma Care doesn't. Ruma Care is pure software sitting between clinics and payer portals, and that's exactly the position that gets compressed as AI makes software cheaper. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is actual painting crews that no amount of AI can replicate. Ruma Care has no operational moat that survives better AI.

The regulatory angle also cuts against them in a way the dossier underweights. CMS-0057-F requires payers to provide PA decisions within seven days and specific denial reasons, with API-based exchange requirements coming in 2027. If payers actually comply -- and 250 million-plus Americans' insurers have committed to streamlining PA burdens by end of 2026 -- the pain point Ruma Care addresses could structurally shrink. The company is automating a process that regulators are actively trying to simplify or eliminate. This isn't fatal, because payer incentives to control specialty drug costs mean PA requirements for $80-150K biologics probably persist, but it puts a visible ceiling on the problem's severity. You're building infrastructure for a bottleneck that the system is actively trying to unclog from the other side.

I respect the founder-market fit here -- there's genuine "I lived this problem" energy that I always take seriously. And the free Formulary Navigator as a lead-gen wedge shows product thinking. But this is ultimately a SaaS automation tool in a crowded healthcare category where the technology is reproducible, the incumbents are well-resourced, and the regulatory environment could erode the addressable problem. Nothing about this is insane enough to generate the non-consensus returns I'm looking for. I'd need to see this team pivot toward becoming actual infrastructure -- a biologics data protocol that payers and providers both integrate with, something closer to a primitive than an application -- before I'd lean in.
