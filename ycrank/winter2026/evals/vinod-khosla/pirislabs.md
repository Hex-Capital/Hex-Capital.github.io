# Piris Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The memory wall is real, and it's the right problem. Every trillion-parameter model running inference today burns most of its time and energy moving data, not computing. The GPU cluster is an inherently electronic architecture trying to feed processors through copper bottlenecks that physics won't let scale much further. If Piris Labs actually delivers photonic interconnects that cut inference cost per token in half while using a tenth of the power -- and they wrap it in a service rather than selling components -- they're not improving AI infrastructure. They're replacing it. That's a consequence worth paying attention to. The AI inference market is approaching $100 billion and accelerating toward $250 billion. An approach that makes the current way of doing things structurally uneconomic would matter at a scale that justifies enormous risk tolerance. This is a problem too important not to work on.

What gives me pause is not the physics -- it's the competitive landscape. Over $1.5 billion has already been deployed into photonic AI infrastructure by Lightmatter, Ayar Labs, Olix, and Neurophos. Ayar Labs has shipped 15,000 optical chiplets and counts NVIDIA among its investors. Lightmatter is valued at $4.4 billion. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, TCP/IP routing was dismissed by every incumbent -- Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. That dismissal was the signal. Here, the incumbents and capital markets have already validated the photonic approach. Nobody is laughing at photonic AI infrastructure in 2026. A two-person team with pre-seed capital entering a category where competitors hold $1.5 billion in war chests is not skating to where the puck will be -- the puck is already there, surrounded by well-funded players.

Ali Khalatpour's credentials are genuine and specific. He didn't study photonics abstractly -- he built the terahertz emission source that NASA selected for the GUSTO mission. That's hardware that had to work in the stratosphere, not a simulation. His PhD work at MIT on quantum cascade lasers and his time at Stanford's photonics lab give him the device-physics intuition that this problem demands. Moghadam's experience scaling AI/ML at Meta and X complements the hardware side. The team composition maps to the venture's two critical competencies -- photonic devices and inference infrastructure -- which is deliberate rather than accidental. But I see no evidence of contrarian courage or outsider naivety. These are experts in their respective fields building exactly what their expertise predicts. That's competence, not the "irreverence and foolish confidence" that produces category-defining companies.

The full-stack service model is the one thing that genuinely differentiates Piris Labs from the field. Every competitor -- Lightmatter, Ayar Labs, Olix, Neurophos -- is selling components or processors to data center operators. Piris Labs says they'll sell inference. That's the Square insight applied to photonic hardware: don't sell the reader, sell the payment service. If executed, it means they don't need to win the photonic component market; they need to win inference workloads on cost and latency. A service model can potentially start at smaller scale, prove unit economics on a limited deployment, and expand -- avoiding the "raise $250 million before your first product ships" trap that photonic hardware companies fall into. This is the bull case, and it's a real one. If the founders can demonstrate even a small-scale proof-of-concept showing their claimed 2x cost advantage on real inference workloads, the service model lets them grow into the market without needing to out-capitalize Lightmatter.

But I've been burned by exactly this pattern. KiOR had brilliant science, a civilization-scale problem, and technology that worked in the lab. What it didn't have was unit economics at production scale -- $5 to $10 per gallon against a $3 market price. That cost me $160 million of my own money. Piris Labs claims 2x lower cost per token, 5x lower latency, 10x lower power per bit. These numbers appear on a YC profile page with no third-party benchmark, no customer testimony, no prototype demonstration visible to the public. When claims this specific are made without verification, I need to see the hardware working, not the slide describing it. The gap between photonic device physics in a lab and production-grade reliability at data center scale -- thermal management, manufacturing yield, integration with existing compute -- is where most hard-tech promises die. Comparable companies with $118 million to $250 million in funding are projecting first commercial products in 2027-2028. What does a $500K pre-seed accomplish against that timeline?

This is a company attacking the right problem with real technical DNA, but arriving at a party where the guests already hold the keys to the building. The service model is a genuine strategic insight that could differentiate them from the component vendors. If Khalatpour can demonstrate a working photonic interconnect prototype that delivers the claimed performance -- even at bench scale -- and wrap it in an inference API that customers can test, this becomes a much more interesting conversation. Right now, it's a thesis in search of a demonstration, competing for a future that well-capitalized incumbents are already building toward.
