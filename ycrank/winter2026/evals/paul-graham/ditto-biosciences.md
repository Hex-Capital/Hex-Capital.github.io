# Ditto Biosciences -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Ditto Bio is that the idea came from a place almost nobody else could reach. These three scientists spent three years together at Arcadia Science -- a startup built specifically around non-model organism biology -- immersed in the world of parasites, phages, and microbial communities. Adair Borges did her PhD on phage-bacteria warfare. Dennis Sun did his on computational genomics with a focus on regenerative biology. Emily Weiss studied microbial communities. They were the people who would naturally notice that parasites have spent millions of years evolving proteins to manipulate the human immune system, and that 98% of those proteins remain uncharacterized. This is the scientific equivalent of what I saw with Stripe: thousands of programmers knew payments were broken, but only the Collisons walked into the banks. Thousands of biologists know parasites modulate immunity, but only people who spent years inside parasitology would see the therapeutic opportunity clearly enough to actually pursue it.

The schlep here is genuine and enormous. Drug development timelines of 10-15 years. Pre-clinical costs of $15-20M. Immunogenicity challenges inherent to putting parasite-derived proteins into humans. A novel regulatory pathway with limited precedent. This is exactly the kind of problem that causes unconscious avoidance -- smart people see autoimmune disease as a market opportunity but unconsciously filter out approaches that require this much patience and specialized knowledge. The structural barrier is real: big pharma does not have parasitology departments. Pivoting to this approach would require building entirely new scientific infrastructure. That's a moat born from schlep, which is the best kind.

But I keep running into a problem I've written about: the multiple miracles requirement. For Ditto to reach patients, their AI platform has to correctly predict candidates (showing early promise with 1-2 nM binding affinities), those candidates have to work in animal models (unknown), the immunogenicity problem has to be solvable (they're building a biobank to address this, which shows awareness but not resolution), regulators have to accept a novel modality, and then clinical trials have to succeed -- historically a 90% failure rate for any given drug candidate. Each miracle multiplies the risk. Stripe needed one miracle: get the technology right. Ditto needs four or five. That's a fundamentally different risk profile.

The team itself is impressive in ways that map partially but not perfectly onto what I look for. Three PhDs with 40+ years of combined domain expertise, 50+ published papers, a patent on anti-CRISPR proteins, and real institutional pedigree -- UCSF, Berkeley, Harvard, UCSD. Dennis Sun's time as Chief of Staff at Arcadia means he's seen how a startup operates from the business side, not just the bench. They've already built a computational platform that has analyzed over a million proteins. But I notice no public GitHub presence, and the "building" here is scientific computation rather than the hacker-builder pattern I'm most calibrated to evaluate. These are brilliant scientists. Whether they can navigate the business side of pharma partnerships, clinical development, and fundraising over a decade-plus timeline is a different question. The three-year working relationship at Arcadia is a strong co-founder signal -- much better than strangers who met at a startup weekend.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Pandion Therapeutics -- conceptually adjacent, doing novel protein therapeutics for autoimmune disease -- was acquired by Merck for $1.9 billion. The competitive landscape (Seismic at $222M raised, Anokion at $225M, Sonoma at $335M) shows massive pharma appetite for next-generation autoimmune approaches, and Ditto occupies a genuinely unique position none of them cover. If the parasite-derived protein approach works even partially, the company becomes an acquisition target or partnership magnet simply because nobody else has the dataset or domain expertise. AlphaFold and modern computational genomics make this feasible now in a way it wasn't five years ago. And the founders' scientific credibility could attract pharma partnerships earlier than a typical pre-clinical company. If I believed one of these candidates could reach IND-enabling studies within two to three years, the valuation math gets very interesting very quickly.

But I have to be honest about where my edge is and isn't. My best investments have been in companies where I could evaluate the product as a potential user, where growth is measurable weekly, and where the founders can reach profitability through pure execution. Ditto Bio requires a decade of capital-intensive drug development before any revenue is possible. There are no "users" to pull the product -- the company is pre-clinical, and the closest thing to user demand is the general pharmaceutical industry appetite for autoimmune therapies. The company is structurally default dead for years, dependent on continuous fundraising. This isn't a company where "ramen profitable" is a meaningful milestone. The organic discovery and schlep blindness are real -- among the strongest I've seen in biotech -- but the structural realities of drug development put this outside the zone where my judgment has proven most reliable.
