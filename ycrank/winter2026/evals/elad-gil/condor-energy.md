# Condor Energy -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment here is real but needs careful parsing. The European energy crisis of 2022-2023 didn't just spike electricity prices -- it fundamentally rewired how large industrial buyers think about power procurement. Before 2022, electricity was a line item you negotiated once a year with your utility rep. After wholesale prices went 10x in parts of Europe, every CFO spending seven figures on electricity realized they were running unhedged exposure to a volatile commodity. That's a behavioral shift, not a temporary panic. Layer on top the rapid buildout of intermittent renewables making wholesale prices structurally more volatile, plus the AI-driven data center boom creating a new class of massive electricity consumers who didn't exist three years ago, and you have a genuine "why now." The question is whether this inflection is non-obvious enough to create asymmetric returns, or whether it's becoming consensus.

The answer is somewhere in between. Energy management software is getting funded -- Voltus at $121M, Pexapark at $42M, Gridmatic at $40M -- so the general category is not neglected. But here's what most investors miss: every one of those competitors serves a different customer. Voltus monetizes demand-side flexibility for grid operators. Pexapark serves renewable energy sellers and developers. Granular Energy tracks certificates for utilities. Nobody has built the operating system for the energy buyer. The C&I procurement desk -- the team actually spending millions on electricity and making hedging decisions in spreadsheets -- is genuinely underserved by software. This fits the archetype I look for: a market that appears "too boring" and "too niche" to attract builder-class founders, but serves a function every large company needs. Gusto looked like "just payroll" but it was really "the operating layer for every employer." Condor could be "the operating layer for every large electricity consumer." Could be.

The founder-market fit is the strongest signal in this dossier. Having a former power trader and equity quant (Florian Pérocheau, ex-Voltalis) alongside two co-founders who built hydropower plants is the right team composition for this specific product. Energy hedging software built by people who've never traded power will miss the workflow details that matter to procurement teams. The combination of energy infrastructure operations and quantitative trading experience maps directly to what Condor needs to build. They also did 200+ customer interviews before building, which tells me they're thinking about distribution from the buyer's perspective rather than from a technology-out perspective. Being live with a data center operator and industrial companies at pre-seed is a meaningful signal -- enterprise customers in energy don't do proof-of-concept deployments casually.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is where this gets interesting but also uncertain. The "Energy OS" framing suggests the founders understand that procurement analytics is a wedge, not the end state. If Condor embeds itself as the system of record for how a company manages its electricity portfolio -- consumption monitoring, hedging execution, capex screening for behind-the-meter assets -- it becomes the natural distribution channel for carbon credit management, renewable energy certificate trading, EV fleet optimization, and demand response participation. That's the Stripe playbook: start with payments, distribute Treasury. Start with procurement, distribute everything the energy buyer needs. But I don't see explicit evidence the founders have articulated this multi-product vision, and the current scope already stretches across three distinct capabilities (monitoring, hedging, capex analysis) that each require depth.

My core concern is commoditization risk, which the dossier correctly identifies as material. Dashboards, price forecasting, hedging analytics -- none of these are technically unique. An energy consulting firm with developers or a Schneider Electric team with a mandate could build comparable features. The integrated workflow is the claimed moat, and it has precedent -- Gusto won payroll despite payroll being technically solved because the integrated platform created switching costs. But Condor hasn't yet demonstrated that its integration creates genuine lock-in rather than convenient bundling. The other concern is the two-geography stretch. European and US power markets are structurally different -- different ISOs, different regulatory regimes, different procurement norms. A 3-person team building for both simultaneously risks the multi-miracle problem: winning enterprise sales in Europe AND adapting the product for US market structure AND building sufficient depth in hedging analytics to displace incumbent consultants. That's three concurrent challenges, not one.

The bull case I'd need to believe: the post-2022 behavioral shift in energy procurement is permanent, the buyer-side gap remains underserved for long enough that Condor can embed itself as the workflow standard, and the data asset from aggregating consumption patterns across multiple large clients creates a forecasting advantage that compounds over time. If those three things prove true, this is a boring-but-critical infrastructure company that could become what Gusto became for payroll -- deeply embedded, high switching costs, and a distribution channel for adjacent products. The data center vertical alone could be enormous. But those are three conditionals, and I'm more comfortable when I can identify exactly one miracle that makes everything else a checkbox.
