# Cardboard -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells the entire story before I need to examine anything else. Descript has raised $101 million and sits at roughly $55 million ARR. Runway has raised $860 million and just closed a $315 million Series E. OpusClip is at $50 million raised. Kapwing has been building browser-based video editing for years. And behind all of them stands Adobe, methodically grafting AI features onto Premiere Pro. When I look at this market, I see five well-funded players and the world's largest creative software company all converging on the same destination: AI-powered video editing. This is not a market with a secret hiding in plain sight. This is a market where the thesis is fully consensus and the players are already imitating each other into mutual value destruction. The Girardian dynamics are unmistakable -- each competitor watches the others, matches their features, and competes away the margins that would justify the investment.

The claimed secret -- that building a browser-native NLE and an agentic AI layer simultaneously from the ground up creates a structural advantage because incumbents cannot rebuild their rendering architectures -- is the single most common thesis in enterprise software today. Every AI-native startup in every vertical makes precisely this argument: "We're building from scratch while incumbents are trapped by legacy code." It is not a secret when every founder in the YC batch could articulate the same insight. A secret must be something that most intelligent people actively disagree with. Nobody disagrees that AI-native architecture has advantages over retrofitted legacy systems. The disagreement, if it exists at all, is about whether this architectural advantage is sufficient to overcome the distribution, capital, and data advantages of incumbents -- and the evidence from this dossier does not resolve that question in Cardboard's favor.

The technology dependency is what concerns me most structurally. Cardboard's "AI director" runs on Claude Sonnet, a third-party API. The multimodal reasoning, the speech understanding, the visual comprehension -- all of it is rented capability. Any startup with competent engineers can call the same API and build a competing orchestration layer. Where is the proprietary technology that creates a 10x advantage? The browser rendering uses WebGPU and WebCodecs -- public standards available to every developer. The compound engineering challenge of combining browser NLE with agentic AI is real, but it is an execution barrier, not a technological moat. Execution barriers buy you months; technological moats buy you decades. When I invested in Palantir, the anti-fraud algorithms we built at PayPal were genuinely proprietary -- years of data and engineering that could not be replicated by calling an API. Cardboard's core intelligence is someone else's model accessed through someone else's API at someone else's pricing.

The strongest version of the bull case would require me to believe that "agentic editing" -- giving the AI a goal and receiving a complete edit -- represents a categorical leap from "AI-assisted editing" where the human still directs the process. If Cardboard can reliably produce broadcast-ready video from raw footage and a natural language prompt, that is genuinely a different product from Descript or Kapwing. Marketing teams that currently spend hours or thousands of dollars on each video could produce dozens of variants in minutes. If this works at production quality, the workflow improvement approaches 10x. The founding team has the right complementary skills for this specific challenge: Ishan's 4.5 years of browser engineering at HackerRank maps directly to the NLE core, and Saksham's AI research and growth background maps to the agentic layer and distribution. Their 15-year relationship reduces co-founder risk. The narrow focus on growth and marketing teams is a sensible beachhead. If I squint hard enough, I can see a version of this where Cardboard becomes the tool that makes professional video editing as accessible as writing a Google Doc -- but that vision requires the agentic output quality to cross a threshold that no one has yet demonstrated reliably, and it requires doing so before Descript, Runway, or Adobe get there with vastly more resources.

But I do not invest on bull cases that require squinting. The fundamental problem is that there is no monopoly path visible here. Network effects in video editing are negligible -- my editing projects do not become more valuable because other people also use Cardboard. Switching costs are minimal; footage and projects can be moved. The AI capability is rented, not owned. The browser platform is open, not proprietary. Scale economies in cloud rendering exist but are available to any well-capitalized competitor. When I map Cardboard against my four sources of monopoly -- proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, branding -- I cannot identify a single one that would be structurally defensible in five years, let alone twenty. A company that cannot answer the durability question is a company that will compete, and we know how that story ends.

This is a pass. The founders are capable, the engineering is real, and the market timing argument is reasonable -- but capable founders in a consensus market with rented technology and no path to monopoly is precisely the profile of a company that will work hard and earn nothing. The power law demands that I invest only where success produces an outcome so extreme it justifies the concentration. Even in the best case, Cardboard becomes one of several video editing tools with AI features, competing on price and feature parity in a market that Adobe will never concede. That is a business, not a monopoly.
