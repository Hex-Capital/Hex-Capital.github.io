# Servo7 -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Servo7 is that they're building hardware robots in a category where competitors have raised, collectively, over three billion dollars. Agility has $400M. Apptronik has $350M from Google. Figure AI has $2.6B. Servo7 has $500K. In software, a funding asymmetry like this can be overcome -- you can build something great with two programmers and a laptop. In hardware, you need to manufacture physical objects, manage supply chains, and deploy technicians on-site. Capital isn't a nice-to-have; it determines whether you can build enough units to learn anything. This is the defining constraint of the company, and everything else has to be evaluated in its shadow.

The question I always ask first is: how did the founders find this problem? And here I can't find the answer I want. Pieter Becking and Jasper van Leuven are TU Delft autonomous systems engineers -- one worked on military drones, the other on hyperloops and autonomous driving. They clearly know how to build things that move autonomously in the real world. But there's no story of organic discovery. Nobody says "I was running a warehouse and watched workers spend hours doing tasks a robot could handle in minutes." The path looks more like: smart robotics engineers surveyed the landscape, noticed warehouse automation was a large and growing market, and decided to apply their skills there. That's the pattern I wrote about in "How to Get Startup Ideas" -- choosing a problem because the market is big rather than because you've been living with it. The idea could have been generated by any competent robotics team reading industry reports. When I don't see an organic origin, I worry the founders will lack the deep, intuitive understanding of their customers that sustains a company through the brutal middle years.

The schlep angle is interesting but cuts both ways. Deploying physical robots in messy industrial environments -- dealing with variable lighting, inconsistent product sizes, safety regulations, floor layouts -- is genuinely painful work that most software engineers want nothing to do with. And these founders have deployment experience in places that matter: military environments, hospitals. Those are contexts where your robot has to work, not just demo well. That's a real signal. But here's what concerns me: this isn't a schlep that's hiding in plain sight. Everyone can see that warehouse automation is a massive opportunity. Billions are flowing into it. When a painful problem has already attracted this much capital and attention, the schlep stops being a moat and becomes table stakes. Stripe worked because for ten years, thousands of programmers saw that payments were broken and nobody touched it. Warehouse robotics in 2026 is the opposite -- everyone is touching it, with very deep pockets.

The bull case for Servo7, and it's a real one, rests on something I've seen work before: being the boring, practical alternative while competitors chase the glamorous version. The big humanoid companies are building bipedal robots that look impressive on stage but struggle with the mundane reality of warehouse floors. Servo7's wheeled platforms and robot arms are less photogenic but potentially more deployable today. If Becking and van Leuven are out there personally installing robots in warehouses -- the way the Collisons would say "give me your laptop" and set up Stripe on the spot -- they could build deployment expertise and customer relationships that the billion-dollar companies, still perfecting bipedal locomotion in their labs, simply don't have. Their "deploy in a day" claim, if true, would be a genuine wedge. The problem is I see no evidence this is actually happening. They reference "working with warehouses and CPG brands" but name no customers, show no revenue, and provide no specifics about deployments. At pre-seed I don't expect much traction, but I do expect founders who are doing things that don't scale to be able to describe those things concretely.

On the technical founder dimension, I give them real credit. Becking has a genuine GitHub presence -- a Boeing deep reinforcement learning project, forks of the key robotics AI frameworks, Pro member status. Van Leuven brings hardware and control systems expertise from military drone work. The founder split of "Training robots" and "Building robots" covers the AI-software and hardware-control halves of the stack. They've built a working demo. These are not PowerPoint founders -- they're people who make things. If I were evaluating them purely as technical talent applied to robotics, I'd be more enthusiastic. The gap is between the quality of the builders and the wisdom of the market they've chosen to build in.

I keep returning to the competitive landscape. When I see a pre-seed company entering a space where Amazon has already acquired one competitor (Covariant) and Google is backing another (Apptronik) at $350M, I have to ask: what does this company know that those companies don't? The answer might be "rapid deployment matters more than impressive hardware" -- and historically, that kind of insight has won. But it's also possible that the big players will figure out deployment too, with far more resources, and Servo7 will be left competing on execution in a hardware business where scale economics favor the incumbents. The open-source LeRobot framework they're building on lowers the barrier for everyone, not just them. I don't see the proprietary wedge that would let them accumulate a durable advantage.

These are competent, technically strong founders entering a real market with a reasonable approach. But I invest my own money in situations where I see something others are missing -- a problem hiding in plain sight, a schlep nobody wants to touch, an organic insight that only these specific founders could have. Here, the problem is visible to everyone, the schlep is attracting billions in capital, and the founders' connection to the specific customer problem appears manufactured rather than lived. I'd want to see named customers, evidence of hands-on deployment learning, and a clearer articulation of why their approach wins in a market this crowded before writing a check.
