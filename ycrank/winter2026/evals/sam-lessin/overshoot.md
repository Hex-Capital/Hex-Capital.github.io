# Overshoot -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Overshoot: the founders are exactly right and the idea is exactly wrong -- for my framework, anyway. Zakaria spent seven years building low-latency surge pricing systems at Uber and wrote GPU kernels at Meta AI. Younes was a founding engineer at COSMONiO, where he built a computer vision training and serving platform that Intel acquired. These are deeply credible infrastructure engineers with precisely the technical background you'd want for building a specialized inference platform. They're cousins -- a real pre-existing relationship, not a co-founder speed-dating match. The "sane" side of the equation is as strong as I've seen in this batch. But the "insane" part is missing entirely. "Real-time video AI inference is going to be massive" is not a non-consensus thesis. It's the consensus thesis. Every partner at every fund in San Francisco believes VLMs are the next platform shift. Building a specialized inference API for video is the standard developer infrastructure playbook executed competently, not a bet that makes other investors squirm. When I backed Brian Armstrong, most of Silicon Valley thought Bitcoin was a joke. When I backed Helium, decentralized IoT wireless sounded like science fiction. Nobody thinks "video AI needs better infrastructure" is crazy -- they think it's obvious. And obvious is where returns go to die.

The deeper issue is that Overshoot fails my AI kill test in a way that's almost philosophical. This isn't a business where AI is a "cherry on top" -- AI IS the business. Remove AI and there is no Overshoot. That's the exact opposite of what I look for. Craftwork would still be a painting company without AI; it would just dispatch crews less efficiently. Metropolis would still operate parking garages without AI; checkout would just be slower. Overshoot without AI is nothing. The company's moat claim rests on inference optimization -- codec tuning, streaming protocols, latency reduction -- which is pure software differentiation. Software moats are dissolving. I've been saying this on CNBC, on X, in the WTF VC deck. And here the moat is specifically software wrapping open-source models that Overshoot doesn't control. Qwen3-VL is Alibaba's. InternVL is Shanghai AI Lab's. Overshoot has no say in model development, licensing changes, or performance improvements. When the upstream models get better, every competitor benefits equally.

The competitive dynamics make this worse. Fireworks AI has raised $331 million at a $4 billion valuation with an estimated $130 million in ARR. Together AI has raised $534 million. These are not hypothetical future competitors -- they already support vision models and have engineering teams that dwarf a two-person startup by orders of magnitude. The argument that they "won't prioritize" video-specific optimization only holds as long as video inference remains a small fraction of total inference demand. The moment it becomes material -- which is the exact scenario where Overshoot succeeds -- every general-purpose inference platform will optimize for it. And AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure all have existing computer vision APIs with massive GPU infrastructure already deployed. Overshoot's specialization advantage is a timing window, not a structural position.

Let me steelman this, though, because the bull case deserves genuine engagement. The strongest argument is that video inference really is fundamentally different from text inference at the systems level -- different enough that it rewards deep specialization the way Twilio rewarded deep specialization in communications APIs even though every cloud provider could theoretically offer telephony. If the codec optimization, frame batching, and streaming protocol work constitute genuinely hard engineering that compounds over time, and if developer lock-in through SDK integration creates real switching costs, then Overshoot could establish itself as the primitive for connecting video feeds to AI models before the generalists catch up. The sub-200ms latency claim, if real and durable, could be the kind of performance moat that matters in real-time applications where even slight degradation makes the product unusable. And the founders' specific combination -- Uber's low-latency systems engineering plus Intel-acquisition-grade CV platform building -- is uncommonly well-matched to this exact technical challenge. For this to work, two things need to be true: the engineering depth required for video-specific optimization must be substantially greater than general-purpose platforms can justify, and Overshoot must convert developer adoption into production deployments with meaningful switching costs before the window closes. I'm not convinced either condition holds, but I acknowledge the possibility.

The narrative could theoretically expand -- "video inference API" to "the infrastructure layer for all real-time visual AI" -- but the expansiveness of the narrative belongs to the category, not to this company. Any video inference startup can tell the same story. The company isn't creating a new primitive that other businesses build on; it's providing a convenience layer on top of primitives created by others. Compare this to Venmo, which established a new payment primitive, or Aleo, which is building zero-knowledge privacy as foundational infrastructure. Overshoot is an application-layer company on someone else's protocol layer, and the "3 lines of code" SDK integration that they tout as a feature is actually evidence of how thin the value-add is. If integration is that easy, de-integration is equally easy. No revenue data exists publicly, which at pre-seed is expected, but the 300-to-1,000 developer count discrepancy and absence of any production deployment signals mean there's no downside cushion either. This is narrative without floor, and I've learned that lesson before.
