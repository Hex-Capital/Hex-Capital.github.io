# Overshoot -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Overshoot is that it sits squarely in the hottest category in tech right now: AI infrastructure. I noted recently that the most impressive YC companies I've seen are not working on AI. That's not because AI is bad — it's because when every VC and every smart engineer is excited about the same category, the idea has already been priced. You're competing not just against other startups but against Fireworks ($4B valuation), Together AI ($3.3B), and every cloud provider with a GPU fleet. When I evaluate whether a problem has been hiding in plain sight because of schlep blindness, "faster inference for vision models" doesn't pass that test. Nobody is unconsciously avoiding this problem. Thousands of engineers at well-funded companies are actively working on it right now. The schlep here is hard engineering, not the kind of ugly institutional complexity — banks, regulations, insurance, trust — that makes people physically recoil. Stripe worked because dealing with banks made programmers nauseous. Making inference faster makes programmers excited. That's a meaningful difference.

That said, the founders' backgrounds are the strongest signal in this dossier. Younes was a founding engineer at COSMONiO, a computer vision company he helped build from scratch before Intel acquired it. He literally built a CV training and serving platform. Zakaria spent seven years building low-latency pricing systems at Uber — surge pricing is real-time inference on messy data at massive scale — and then went to Meta AI and wrote GPU kernels and inference engines. These are not two people who read about VLMs on Hacker News and decided to start a company. They've been inside the inference and computer vision stacks for years. The idea almost certainly grew from watching the transition from traditional computer vision to vision language models and seeing that existing inference platforms weren't built for the specific demands of continuous video streams. That's a genuine organic origin, even if the dossier doesn't give me the vivid "I kept forgetting my USB drive" moment I look for.

The question I keep returning to is whether video-specific inference optimization is a company or a feature. The SDK is "3 lines of code." The underlying models — Qwen, InternVL — are open-source and available to everyone. The claimed moat is specialization in codecs, streaming protocols, and inference pipelines tuned for video. That's real engineering work, but it's the kind of optimization that Fireworks or Together could build with a dedicated team in months if the market demanded it. Roboflow built a real business by specializing in computer vision tooling, but Roboflow's value prop was an end-to-end pipeline — labeling, training, deployment — that created genuine switching costs. An inference API with sub-200ms latency is a thinner surface to defend.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. If "video agents" become a major application category — security systems that understand what they see, robots that process visual environments in real-time, gaming AI that watches and reacts — then the inference layer for video could be enormous. And the argument that video is fundamentally different from text is technically sound: codec optimization, frame-rate management, motion understanding across clips, streaming protocol engineering. A general-purpose inference platform optimizes for breadth; Overshoot optimizes for depth in a modality that genuinely requires different engineering. If the market grows fast enough, being the specialized video inference API that developers reach for first could create the kind of developer lock-in that makes switching painful even when alternatives exist. These founders, specifically, are among the most qualified two-person teams I could imagine to build this. The technical hacker signal is strong — they've both built core infrastructure at scale, and they built this product themselves.

But strong founders in a consensus category with thin traction and well-funded competitors isn't enough for me to write a check. Three hundred developers on a platform with no visible revenue, no pricing, and 12 GitHub stars doesn't tell me people want this badly enough. Compare that to Wufoo reaching profitability within nine months, or early Stripe users who immediately felt the pain relief of simpler payment integration. I want to see developers who tried Overshoot and started building production applications on it — not hackathon usage, but someone whose security system or robotics pipeline depends on this API. That signal might exist and simply isn't public yet at this stage. But without it, I'm investing on team quality and market thesis alone, and the market thesis is one that every infrastructure investor already believes.

The founders are impressive. The timing might be right. But the competitive moat is thin, the category is crowded, and the evidence of genuine user pull is insufficient. I'd want to see this team again in six months with production customers who'd be hurt if the product disappeared.
