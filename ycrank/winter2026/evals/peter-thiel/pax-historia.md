# Pax Historia -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking fact about Pax Historia is 35,000 daily active users in four months with zero paid acquisition. That is a genuinely unusual traction signal at pre-seed, and I want to be honest about what it means and what it does not mean. What it means is that these founders built something people want to use -- the product works, the experience is novel, and the viral loop from user-generated presets is functioning. What it does not mean is that this company has discovered a secret. The thesis underlying Pax Historia -- that large language models can replace pre-scripted game content with emergent, AI-generated narratives -- is one of the most widely held beliefs in the gaming industry today. Paradox Interactive has already announced AI-driven procedural content generation for Europa Universalis V. Every major studio and dozens of startups are exploring this exact intersection. When your thesis is shared by the incumbent, it is by definition not contrarian. A secret must be something that most intelligent people would actively argue against. "AI will transform gaming" is something everyone agrees on. There is no secret here -- there is a timing advantage, and timing advantages are fragile.

The deeper structural problem is that the entire technology stack is composed of commodity components. The product runs on third-party LLMs -- Grok, Gemini, Deepseek -- accessed via API, rendered in a browser with map visualization, glued together with prompt engineering. There are no proprietary model weights. There is no custom training data that could not be replicated. The operational expertise in multi-model routing and cost optimization is real -- a 60% cost reduction through Infron's infrastructure is competent engineering -- but it is tacit operational knowledge, not proprietary technology. When I invested in Palantir, the core algorithms from PayPal's anti-fraud system represented genuine intellectual property that could not be reverse-engineered from the outside. When Stripe built its developer-first payments API, the integration depth with banking infrastructure created compounding technical moats. Pax Historia's technology, by contrast, could be rebuilt by any competent team with access to the same foundation model APIs. The 10x improvement over traditional grand strategy -- arbitrary scenario generation versus fixed narrative trees -- is genuinely new as a product experience, but the mechanism producing it is commodity inference. This is a 1-to-n deployment of someone else's 0-to-1 technology.

The founders present a second concern. Eli Bullock-Papa is an engineering student at Virginia Tech whose prior experience includes Capital One and Olive Garden. Ryan Zhang's YC biography is three words: "I like history." I do not require founders to have Stanford PhDs or prior exits -- Zuckerberg was a nineteen-year-old when I wrote my check, and Vitalik Buterin was younger still when he received his fellowship. But what both of those founders demonstrated was unmistakable intellectual depth: Zuckerberg had a specific, articulable vision for how real-identity networking would restructure social behavior, and Buterin had a cryptographic and game-theoretic framework for programmable money that he could defend against any expert challenger. I see no evidence that the Pax Historia founders possess equivalent depth -- no articulated thesis about why AI-native gaming creates structural monopoly, no visible intellectual framework beyond building a product that is fun. Execution capability is evident in the traction numbers, and I do not dismiss that. But execution without a definite vision for how the endgame unfolds is the lean startup methodology dressed in better numbers. Where are these founders trying to be in ten years, and why will they -- specifically they -- be the ones who get there?

The strongest bull case requires me to take the UGC marketplace seriously as a network-effect engine. Four thousand community-published presets with fifty-plus plays each, combined with a 10% token commission for creators, does begin to resemble a platform flywheel: creators attract players, players discover presets, popular presets incentivize more creation. If this flywheel accelerates faster than any competitor can replicate the content library, the company could achieve something analogous to what Roblox accomplished -- not through proprietary technology, but through content density and creator lock-in. The critical difference, however, is that Roblox creators invested thousands of hours learning proprietary development tools that could not transfer to competing platforms. A Pax Historia preset is a configuration of prompts and parameters that could be trivially ported to any alternative AI strategy sandbox. The switching costs for creators are low, which means the content moat is shallow. For this to be a great investment, I would need to believe either that no well-funded competitor will enter this niche for the next three to five years -- unlikely given how hot AI gaming has become -- or that the community itself becomes the irreplaceable asset, which is possible but historically rare in gaming outside of Roblox and Minecraft. I would also need to believe that the token economy can generate meaningful revenue per user, and no public monetization data exists to test that belief.

The one dimension where Pax Historia performs well against my framework is small-market dominance. They have identified a specific niche -- AI-powered grand strategy -- that sits in an unoccupied gap between traditional grand strategy games and text-only AI adventures. No direct, well-funded competitor occupies this exact position today. The expansion path from grand strategy to other AI game genres, and from browser to mobile (evidenced by the Unity Mobile engineer job posting), is legible. This is deliberate narrowness that creates dominance in a small market, exactly the playbook I advocate. But a good wedge strategy only matters if the wedge leads to a monopoly, and I see no structural mechanism by which early dominance in AI grand strategy becomes an unassailable position in the broader AI gaming category. The niche is well-chosen, but the niche alone is not enough.

I pass. The traction is real, the timing is good, and the product clearly resonates with players. But traction without structural defensibility is a consumer wave, not a monopoly. The technology is commodity. The secret is consensus. The founders have not articulated a vision that explains why their position compounds rather than erodes as larger players enter with better models, bigger budgets, and established distribution. This is a company built on someone else's infrastructure, in a category that everyone can see is exciting, with no visible mechanism for becoming the last mover. Competition in AI gaming is about to become fierce, and competition is where profits go to die.
