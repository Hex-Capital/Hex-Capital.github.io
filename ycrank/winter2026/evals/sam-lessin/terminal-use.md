# Terminal Use -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Terminal Use in a single sentence: they chose "Vercel for background agents" as their tagline, and Vercel has already launched agent hosting with Fluid compute, agent SDKs, and the Skills.sh open ecosystem. When your positioning statement doubles as a roadmap for the incumbent you're trying to displace, you've told me everything I need to know about the competitive dynamics. Vercel has established developer distribution, brand trust, and the engineering resources to adapt its architecture. Terminal Use has three public GitHub repos with zero to one stars each. That's not a David-and-Goliath setup -- it's walking onto a battlefield where E2B ($21M raised, claiming 88% of Fortune 100 signed up), Daytona ($31M raised, $1M ARR in under three months), and Modal Labs ($111M raised, raising again at $2.5B) have already established positions with real traction. This is a consensus category with consensus-level capital flowing in, which is the opposite of where I want to deploy my own money.

The founders clear my "sane" bar comfortably. Three ex-Palantir engineers who went to university together and deepened their relationship working at the same company -- that co-founder dynamic is exactly the kind of pre-existing relational depth I look for. Vivek Raja leading the technical delivery of one of the largest agent use cases across US hospitals at Palantir is a genuinely relevant credential. Stavros built dev tooling infrastructure there. Filip worked on Ontology and Foundry. These are people who've shipped production infrastructure at scale. But the "insane" half of my equation is entirely absent. Agent infrastructure is the single most crowded category in developer tools right now. Fortune Business Insights projects the AI agents market at $251 billion by 2034. Every VC partner in San Francisco is asking founders "what's your agent story?" This isn't contrarian -- it's the consensus play of the cycle. Sane people pursuing a sane idea gives me a well-funded features team, not a non-consensus bet that produces asymmetric returns.

My AI kill test produces a uniquely damning result here. Usually I'm asking "does AI make this business stronger or weaker?" The answer for Terminal Use is neither -- AI is the entire business. Remove AI agents from the world and Terminal Use has no customers, no use case, no reason to exist. That's the exact inverse of my "cherry on top" framework. I want businesses that would be great without AI, where AI non-obviously accelerates them. Craftwork's moat is its painting crews and operational logistics -- AI helps with scheduling but can't replace the people on ladders. Terminal Use has no equivalent physical or structural moat. The dossier itself concedes the point: "The core technical components -- container orchestration, filesystem isolation, CLI tooling -- are well-understood infrastructure patterns." Software that orchestrates software is the most AI-commoditizable category I can imagine. As AI models get better at self-orchestration -- and they will -- the tooling layer becomes thinner, not thicker.

The strongest bull case requires believing two things simultaneously: that the agent infrastructure market will be enormous, and that Terminal Use's specific focus on filesystem-heavy background agents carves out a durable niche within it. There's an argument that ephemeral sandbox providers like E2B and general compute platforms like Modal leave a genuine gap for persistent, stateful agent orchestration. If the agent paradigm shifts decisively toward long-running processes that manage local filesystems -- coding agents that maintain project context across sessions, data processing pipelines that require persistent state -- then Terminal Use's opinionated approach could attract a devoted developer segment. The Palantir pedigree matters here: these founders actually deployed agents at hospital scale, so they're building from operator experience rather than thesis-first abstraction. If I squint, I can see a path where workflow lock-in develops -- once teams wire their evaluation, deployment, and A/B testing pipelines through Terminal Use's CLI, switching costs accumulate. But "if I squint" is not how I write checks from my own account. The filesystem-heavy bet is also an architectural wager that could narrow sharply if the ecosystem evolves toward stateless, API-based agent architectures, and there's no evidence of any customer validation that this specific wedge matters enough to build a company around.

This company occupies the worst quadrant of my framework: pure software, pure AI-dependent, consensus category, no traction, and outgunned on capital by an order of magnitude. The founders are credible operators, and in a world with less competition and a more structural moat, I'd want to track them. But I'd rather fund their next company -- one where they take their hard-won understanding of agent deployment and apply it to something with physical-world friction, proprietary data compounding, or protocol-layer lock-in. This one's a pass.
