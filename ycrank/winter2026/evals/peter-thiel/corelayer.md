# Corelayer -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know before you read a single line about the product. Resolve AI raised $125 million at a billion-dollar valuation two months ago. incident.io has $96 million. BigPanda has $431 million. PagerDuty is a public company generating $440 million in annual revenue. And now a two-person pre-seed team enters the same arena with a variation on the same thesis every one of these companies already promotes: AI can automate incident response. This is not a market with a secret hiding in it. This is a market where every participant can see the same opportunity, is building the same features, and is competing for the same enterprise buyers. The mimetic dynamics are unmistakable -- each company watches the others, copies the others, and burns capital matching the others' capabilities. When I ask "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" and the answer is "data pipelines need better debugging tools," I know immediately that this is a truth everyone agrees with. That is not a secret. That is a consensus dressed in specificity.

The founders would likely argue that their secret is the distinction between infrastructure monitoring and data-content debugging -- that current tools watch whether servers are healthy but cannot inspect whether the data flowing through pipelines is correct. This is a real observation, and I credit them for having lived inside the problem at Goldman Sachs, where they processed hundreds of billions of rows daily. But a real observation is not the same as a contrarian truth. Every data engineer at every Fortune 500 company knows that bad data causes incidents that Datadog cannot detect. The question is whether recognizing this problem gives Corelayer a path to monopoly, and the dossier itself answers that question definitively: "The core capabilities -- log monitoring, anomaly detection, LLM-powered root-cause analysis -- are individually reproducible." When the building blocks of your product are available to every well-funded competitor, the company's differentiation window is measured in months, not decades. Datadog adding a data anomaly layer to its existing monitoring platform is a feature sprint, not a strategic impossibility.

The regulated-industry wedge -- on-premises deployment, confidential compute, SOC 2 Type I certification -- is the strongest element of the positioning. There is a genuine architectural tension between cloud-native monitoring companies and the compliance requirements of financial services and healthcare. Forcing Datadog to build on-prem infrastructure conflicts with its SaaS margin structure. This is the argument I would make if I were advocating for this investment: own the intersection of AI-driven data debugging and regulated-industry deployment, build deep integrations with customer-specific data pipeline architectures, create switching costs through accumulated system knowledge, and expand from there. If Corelayer could achieve what Palantir achieved in intelligence -- becoming so deeply embedded in customer workflows that ripping it out is unthinkable -- this could be a defensible business. But Palantir's moat was not its deployment model. Palantir had genuinely proprietary algorithms derived from PayPal's anti-fraud system, a founding relationship with the CIA through In-Q-Tel, and a seven-year runway of patient capital to build before reaching profitability. Corelayer has LLMs that every competitor has access to, no visible proprietary algorithmic advantage, and an enterprise sales motion that requires navigating Fortune 100 procurement cycles with a two-person team. The analogy to Palantir reveals the gap rather than closing it.

The founders have relevant domain expertise -- Goldman Sachs data infrastructure is credible preparation for building tools that serve Goldman Sachs-like customers. But domain expertise is necessary, not sufficient. What I do not see is a definite vision for how the world fundamentally changes. The cost calculator on their website estimates that a 100-engineer team could save $2.8 million annually by reducing support time from 20% to 6%. This is the language of incremental optimization, not the language of a founder who has designed a specific future and refuses to compromise on it. Saving engineers 14 percentage points of their time on on-call duty is a valuable service. It is not a civilizational proposition, and it does not generate power-law returns. The technology itself -- assembling existing LLM capabilities with existing monitoring integrations across 20+ tools -- is competent systems integration, not a zero-to-one discontinuity. Nothing in this product makes a previously impossible thing possible.

For this investment to work at the scale I require, Corelayer would need to become the definitive platform for AI-driven operations in regulated industries -- not just data debugging, but the entire operational intelligence layer for financial services, healthcare, and insurance. The regulated-industry wedge would need to prove genuinely impenetrable to cloud-native incumbents, and the accumulated customer-specific knowledge would need to create compounding switching costs. But even in this optimistic scenario, I count at least four well-funded competitors who could pursue the same regulated-industry strategy with more capital and larger teams. The absence of any visible proprietary technology, combined with the presence of a crowded competitive field pursuing overlapping theses, makes this a market where margins will trend toward zero. I pass.
