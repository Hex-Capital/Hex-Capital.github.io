# REV1 -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company entering a space where the incumbents are not dismissing them -- they are *building the same feature themselves*. SolidWorks shipped Auto-Generate Drawings as a beta in 2025. Siemens NX already includes automated 2D drawing creation. DraftAid, a YC W24 company, has been selling this exact product for two years and reports $150K in paid pilot contracts. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never do a TCP/IP router. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry called plant-based meat absurd. The signal I look for -- experts actively dismissing the approach -- is inverted here. Everyone agrees drawing automation is coming. The experts are building it. The incumbents are shipping it. That tells me the consequence of success has been pre-bounded by the market itself: REV1 wins a share of a feature that Dassault Systèmes considers a checkbox item in their $6 billion platform.

Let me ask the question I always ask first: if REV1 succeeds completely, what changes? Mechanical engineers save some portion of the 25% of time they spend creating 2D drawings. That is real time savings. But no industry operates differently. Hardware companies still design the same products, send them to the same machine shops, use the same CAD platforms, manufacture parts the same way. The drawings arrive faster. This is the textbook definition of making an enterprise workflow more efficient -- the kind of bet where the founders have reduced their probability of failure to the point where the consequence of success is a modest business in a competitive market. Nobody's life is materially different. No trillion-dollar system becomes structurally obsolete. The consequence magnitude here is capped at "solid vertical SaaS company," and I do not write checks for that outcome.

What frustrates me is that these are founders who *could* be attacking a bigger problem. Alex Rivero built seven CNC machine prototypes, designed motor test equipment at Tesla, worked on the iPhone 17 at Apple. Louis Liu solo-built Tesla's global Supercharger and Robotaxi planning platform and is a published ML researcher. These are people who have touched the physical manufacturing pipeline at the most consequential hardware companies on the planet. They could be attacking the fundamental gap between design intent and manufacturability -- the reason 60% of parts need redesign because the original CAD model cannot actually be machined as specified. They could be building the AI system that replaces CAD altogether, generating optimized manufacturing-ready geometry from functional specifications. Instead they chose the most validated, most consensus, most incremental step in the engineering workflow: converting 3D files into 2D documentation. The ambition is miscalibrated to these founders' capabilities. They are too talented for a problem this small.

The bull case deserves engagement. Someone will argue that drawing automation is a wedge -- that once you own the drawing step, you expand into tolerance stack-up analysis, design-for-manufacturability feedback, automated quoting, and eventually the entire bridge between design and manufacturing. That is the Square analogy: start with a simple card reader, become a financial services platform. But Square did not make payment processing 30% faster for existing merchants -- it made card acceptance *possible* for an entirely new category of sellers who had been locked out. That was a structural expansion of the market, not a workflow improvement for existing participants. REV1 is making something existing users already do slightly faster. The wedge argument could justify any B2B SaaS investment; I need to see the ambition for the platform, not just the foothold. And even if the wedge thesis is correct, DraftAid has a two-year head start running the same play. In AI-powered vertical tools, two years of customer feedback data and manufacturing-standard validation is not trivial to replicate.

The team composition is the one genuinely strong signal. Alex as the domain expert who personally created hundreds of these drawings at Tesla and Apple, paired with Louis as the ML engineer who built production-scale platforms -- this is deliberate, risk-mitigating team construction. They have the right gene pool for *this specific problem*. But having the right team for the wrong problem is not sufficient. I would tell Alex and Louis: you have the engineering depth and the ML capability to build something that transforms how physical products get designed and manufactured. Do not waste that on automating paperwork that SolidWorks is already shipping as a free beta feature. Find the problem that terrifies you, that Dassault's product team would never attempt because it threatens their $180-per-seat pricing model. That is where I would write a check.
