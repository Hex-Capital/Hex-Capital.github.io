# Pax Historia -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Thirty-five thousand daily active users in four months with zero paid acquisition. That number stopped me. At pre-seed, with $500K and a three-person team, that kind of organic pull is unusual enough to demand explanation. When users are building wikis, publishing thousands of scenarios for each other, and someone on Hacker News builds an autonomous agent just to play your game -- those aren't metrics you manufacture. Something real is happening here. The question is whether the thing that's real is a company or a moment.

Here's where I get stuck. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer is thin. Ryan Zhang's YC bio is "I like history." Eli Bullock-Papa studied engineering at Virginia Tech and worked at Capital One and Olive Garden. I can't find the moment where these founders were doing something and ran into a wall that became Pax Historia. That matters. The strongest companies I've funded started when founders were living inside a problem -- Houston forgot his USB drive, the Airbnb founders couldn't make rent, the Collison brothers were building apps and hating payment integration. "I like history and AI is newly capable" is a different species of origin. It's the kind of idea that gets generated when smart people sit down and think about what to build, rather than when they stumble into something broken. The schlep here is real -- managing 100 billion tokens per week, optimizing across multiple model providers, achieving 60% cost reduction through intelligent routing -- but it's operational schlep, not the kind of structural complexity that deters competitors for years. Anyone with access to the same foundation models and a decent frontend engineer can attempt this.

That said, I have to take the user pull seriously. Four thousand community-published presets with a creator commission system is the beginning of a content flywheel. Two independently created community wikis. A subreddit. A Discord. Viral tweets getting 140K views. This is what genuine demand looks like -- not projected TAM analysis, but humans choosing to spend their time creating things inside your product and telling other humans about it. I learned a long time ago not to dismiss evidence of wanting just because the origin story doesn't fit my framework perfectly. When the Wufoo founders showed me their product, the enthusiasm from users was so obvious it overrode other concerns. There's a version of that happening here. Nearly 20 million rounds played means people aren't just trying it -- they're coming back.

The bull case is that this occupies a genuine competitive gap. Paradox Interactive can't easily ship an AI-native product because it would cannibalize their DLC revenue model -- every hand-authored expansion pack they sell would be undermined by a system that generates content dynamically. AI Dungeon is text-only. Nobody else has combined LLM-driven narrative with map-based geopolitical simulation. If the UGC flywheel keeps compounding -- more presets attract more players who create more presets -- the content library becomes the moat rather than the technology. And these founders, young as they are, have already demonstrated they can ship and scale. College-age founders have worked before -- Huffman and Ohanian were 22 when they built Reddit in YC's first batch. The combination of good timing (inference costs crossing the viability threshold), good taste (the product clearly works), and organic community formation is genuinely compelling.

But consumer gaming makes me nervous in a way that developer tools don't. Games are hit-driven. The mechanics that make a game viral in month four can feel stale in month twelve. And the core technology -- LLM inference routed through third-party providers, a map UI, prompt engineering for geopolitical simulation -- is reproducible. If Paradox decides to acquire an AI team rather than build in-house, or if a well-funded studio ships something with higher production values, the 4,000 presets may not be enough to hold users. The founders are hiring across three engineering roles simultaneously, which suggests the current team recognizes it needs reinforcement fast. That's honest, but it also means the product's technical future depends on people not yet in the room. The monetization question looms large too: 35,000 DAU playing a free browser game is different from 35,000 DAU paying for tokens. Until conversion rates are proven, this is engagement without economics.

These are the kinds of founders I want to root for -- young, building, shipping, getting traction. But when I run my tests in sequence, the organic origin is weak, the schlep is operational rather than structural, and the defensibility depends on community accumulation speed rather than anything intrinsic to the product. What I'd want to see before writing a check is evidence that users will pay -- not just play -- and some sign that the founders' connection to this problem runs deeper than "AI makes this possible now." If the token economy shows real conversion and the community keeps compounding, this could become the kind of company where the early traction was the signal and I was wrong to want a better origin story. I've been wrong about that before. But I'm not convinced enough today to bet my own money on it.
