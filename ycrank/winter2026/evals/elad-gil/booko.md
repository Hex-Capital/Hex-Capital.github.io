# Booko -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I look at with Booko is the integration dependency, because it tells you everything about where the value accrues. Booko sits on top of Mindbody, Vagaro, Acuity -- booking platforms that own the customer relationship, own the scheduling data, and control API access. This is the structural problem. When I invested in Stripe, the insight was that Stripe owned the developer integration point -- it became the distribution channel. Booko doesn't own the integration point. The booking platform does. Booko is a middleware pricing layer that can be switched off, replicated as a feature, or blocked at the API level by the very platforms it depends on. Vagaro acquired Schedulicity in January 2025, signaling consolidation ambitions. When an incumbent is already acquiring companies in adjacent functionality, a startup building a feature that sits on top of that incumbent has a timing problem, not a timing advantage.

The "why now" question is where this falls apart for me. I need a specific structural moment -- a technology threshold being crossed, a cost curve bending, a regulation shifting. The dossier's "why now" is entirely inferred: cloud booking APIs exist, ML is cheaper, ClassPass normalized dynamic pricing, post-COVID competition. Every one of those conditions has been true for three to five years. Cloud booking APIs have been accessible since 2015. ML-based demand prediction has been commodity infrastructure since at least 2020. ClassPass launched in 2013. If this market were going to produce a breakout pricing optimization company, the structural conditions already existed well before 2025. When there's no clear inflection point, the question becomes: why hasn't someone already won this? The answer is usually that the market doesn't support standalone companies at the layer you're targeting -- it's a feature, not a product.

The Mindbody channel conflict is the one genuinely interesting structural observation. Mindbody makes 20% commissions through ClassPass marketplace transactions. Building a B2B-side dynamic pricing tool that works within a studio's existing customer base would directly cannibalize ClassPass revenue. That's a real channel conflict that creates a window. But it's a window, not a moat. Vagaro has no such conflict and $65.9M in revenue with a $1B valuation. Acuity sits inside Squarespace. Either of these could add ML-based pricing optimization as a feature within their existing platform at marginal cost. And Mindbody itself could decide the B2B pricing tool revenue exceeds the ClassPass cannibalization -- channel conflicts resolve when the math changes.

To be fair, the bull case deserves engagement. Yield management for local service businesses IS a "too boring" market that most investors would dismiss -- it sounds like a feature for hair salons. And the perishable inventory framing is economically correct: an empty appointment slot at a med spa is genuinely analogous to an empty airline seat. If Booko could accumulate cross-business demand data across thousands of locations, the data flywheel could create real prediction advantages that individual booking platforms couldn't match with their siloed data. The 15-25% revenue uplift claim, if real and repeatable across verticals, would make this a no-brainer purchase for any service business. The path to a larger company would be: start with pricing, expand to demand forecasting, then staffing optimization, then marketing spend -- becoming the "revenue intelligence layer" for local services. Will Hall's marketing agency background and Arjun Saluja's dynamic pricing work at Joby Aviation are relevant to the problem space. That's the version of this story where it works.

But the product-to-distribution trajectory is where the bull case breaks down. Dynamic pricing optimization is a single feature with a single value proposition. It doesn't create the kind of customer relationship that enables distributing additional products through the same integration. Stripe's API was embedded in every checkout flow, which made it the natural channel for billing, fraud detection, and treasury management. Booko's pricing adjustment sits adjacent to the booking flow, not embedded in it. The customer doesn't think of Booko as infrastructure -- they think of it as a tool that generates discounts. There's no distribution channel being built. And the founders haven't articulated a multi-product vision in any public materials -- the website describes one thing: fill empty slots through dynamic pricing. At pre-seed I don't require founders to have built a platform, but I need to see that the market structure allows for one. A pricing overlay on third-party booking systems doesn't compound.

The founders are early-career -- both recent Dartmouth graduates, which is fine at pre-seed, but the target customers are multi-location service businesses where sales cycles involve operations managers and franchise owners. Enterprise-adjacent sales with no visible enterprise experience is a concern, not because young founders can't learn, but because the single-miracle test here actually reveals multiple obstacles: prove the ML pricing works across verticals, secure and maintain API partnerships with potentially hostile booking platforms, and sell to unsophisticated SMB buyers who aren't used to paying for optimization software. That's three things that all need to go right, and none of them reinforce each other.

This is a pass. Real problem, valid economic insight about perishable inventory, but no structural inflection driving "why now," limited platform trajectory, and a feature-layer positioning that incumbents can absorb. The market has been accessible for years and hasn't produced a standalone winner at this layer -- that's usually a signal about market structure, not about a missing entrepreneur.
