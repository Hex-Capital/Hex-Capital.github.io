# Stilta -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Stilta walks directly into the killzone I've been warning about for two years. "Cursor for patent attorneys" is a pitch that would have been exciting in 2023. In February 2026, it's a consensus play entering a market that's already been colonized. Solve Intelligence has $55M raised and 8-figure ARR. DeepIP hit 7-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics grew 20x in six months with Google's Gradient backing them. When I say "if every VC wants in, the insane-idea premium has been arbitraged away," this is what I mean. The AI-for-patent-work thesis isn't insane -- it's a category with multiple scaled winners and over $90M in aggregate competitor funding. Stilta isn't bringing a non-consensus view to an overlooked market; they're bringing a fourth entrant to a gold rush.

The team compounds this problem rather than solving it. Four McKinsey and QuantumBlack alumni are exactly who you'd expect to build an AI workflow tool -- and that's the issue. They're credible AI engineers and management consultants, but none of them have ever drafted a patent claim, prosecuted an application before the USPTO, or navigated the jurisdictional nuances of international IP law. Patent work isn't generic knowledge work. It's a domain where a mischaracterized claim limitation can invalidate an entire portfolio. When I look for "sane person, insane idea," the sanity has to be domain-specific. Brian Armstrong wasn't just smart -- he understood financial infrastructure from Airbnb. Anatoly Yakovenko wasn't just an engineer -- he understood hardware clock synchronization from Qualcomm in a way that directly produced Solana's proof-of-history consensus mechanism. Here, the founders' competence and the idea's requirements don't have that tight coupling. They're smart generalists attacking a specialist's domain.

The structural moat question is where my framework really punishes this company. Strip away the AI, and what does Stilta have? Nothing. The business doesn't exist without LLMs. That's the opposite of my "cherry on top" test. Craftwork would still be a painting company without AI -- a good one. Teamshares would still be acquiring small businesses through employee ownership. Those businesses have physical operations, installed infrastructure, or structural positions that software amplifies but cannot constitute. Stilta is pure software sitting on top of broadly available LLM capabilities. The "auditability and traceability" features they emphasize are product decisions, not moats -- any competitor can implement source attribution. The "agentic workspace" positioning is an architecture choice, not a defensible asset. When I wrote that software companies' moats are dissolving, I was describing exactly this category of company.

The bull case, which I want to take seriously: perhaps the end-to-end workspace positioning is genuinely differentiated. Competitors focus on individual tasks -- Solve on drafting, DeepIP on Word-embedded drafting, Patlytics on analytics. If Stilta can consolidate multiple patent workflows into a single platform where practitioners do everything, the switching costs could become real over time. Legal workflows are sticky once embedded in firm processes. And the patent market is large enough ($1.3B immediately addressable by DeepIP's estimate) to support multiple winners. The CEO bootstrapped two ventures to $1M+ ARR, which demonstrates he can actually sell and build revenue, not just raise. If they can land a few major law firms and build deep workflow integration faster than competitors expand laterally, there's a path to a meaningful outcome. But that path requires outrunning companies with 10-50x more capital while simultaneously building across multiple verticals with a four-person team. The breadth-versus-depth tradeoff at this resource level is brutal.

This is an application-layer software tool in a hot category with well-funded incumbents, built by a team without domain expertise, whose entire value proposition depends on AI capabilities that every competitor also possesses. It's the archetype of what I pass on. I'd rather fund someone running a patent law firm who discovered they could use AI to 3x their throughput -- that's a "cherry on top" business with operational moat. Stilta is a tech company with a patent layer, and I want a patent company with a tech layer.
