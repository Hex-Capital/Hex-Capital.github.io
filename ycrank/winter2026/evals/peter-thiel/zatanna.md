# Zatanna -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells the entire story before I even reach the founders. Trust AI has raised $6.5 million and put 8,000 dentists on its platform. DentalRobot has been training its AI on dental workflows for five years. Overjet has $133 million in funding and covers 120 million insurance members. Pearl has FDA clearance and 150,000 practitioners. Into this arena walks Zatanna -- a three-person pre-seed team proposing to automate dental billing with AI agents. This is not a company entering a market. This is a company entering a war. And the first question any serious investor must ask is: what does this team know that four well-funded competitors do not?

The answer, as far as I can determine, is nothing. "AI can automate dental administrative work" is not a secret -- it is the consensus thesis of an entire subcategory. The claim that tribal knowledge of billing staff can be institutionalized into learning infrastructure is what every AI agent company in every vertical is saying right now, often word for word. A secret must be something that most intelligent people would actively argue against. No intelligent person in 2026 argues against the proposition that AI can handle insurance claims processing. The insight is so consensus that multiple companies have already raised tens of millions of dollars pursuing it. When I look for the contrarian truth that would give Zatanna a structural path to monopoly -- some non-obvious understanding of insurer behavior, some proprietary data pipeline that compounds, some technological approach that makes the competitors' work obsolete -- I find nothing. The 30,000 EOB dataset is cited as a differentiator, but this is a modest corpus by any training standard, and Trust AI with 8,000 practices almost certainly has more. The "continuously learning" claim is table stakes for any modern ML system. The mimetic dynamics here are textbook -- multiple companies imitating each other's positioning, each claiming their version of AI dental billing is differentiated, while the structural reality is that they are all building similar products on similar foundations for the same customers.

The founders are recent university graduates -- Vanga from Michigan (2025), Vedula from Wisconsin-Madison (2026 expected). Their prior experience at Coinbase, Amazon, and Hamming AI demonstrates engineering competence, but none has any documented connection to dental practice operations, insurance billing, or healthcare revenue cycle management. Compare this to how Palantir began: we had built the fraud detection algorithms at PayPal ourselves, understood the intelligence analysis problem through direct government engagement, and co-founded the company with Alex Karp, whose intellectual depth brought a philosophical seriousness to the enterprise. Zatanna's founding team appears to have identified dental billing as a promising AI application from the outside, not from lived experience within the problem. This is not disqualifying at pre-seed, but it means the company lacks the founder-domain resonance that generates genuine secrets -- the kind of insight that only comes from years inside a system, seeing what everyone else overlooks because they have stopped looking.

The strongest bull case requires believing that dental billing, despite its apparent commoditization as an AI use case, has hidden complexity that rewards the team that cracks it first -- and that Zatanna's specific approach to codifying insurer-specific patterns creates a data flywheel that compounds faster than competitors can replicate. If the EOB dataset grows non-linearly with each new practice, and if the insurer-specific appeal logic becomes genuinely predictive in ways that generic LLM applications cannot match, then the first company to reach critical mass in this data loop could build meaningful switching costs. The dental vertical is also fragmented -- roughly 200,000 practicing dentists in the U.S., most in small practices -- which means that an AI billing tool that genuinely works could spread through word of mouth and professional networks faster than enterprise software typically does. But this bull case requires Zatanna to outrun Trust AI's existing 8,000-dentist head start and DentalRobot's five-year training advantage, both of which are substantial barriers for a pre-seed company with no visible traction. The power law demands that I ask whether this company, at maximum success, could produce a return that justifies the investment on its own. In a dental RCM market of $748 million growing at 5% annually, even total category dominance produces a good business, not a great one. The expansion path to broader healthcare billing faces genuine structural barriers -- different coding systems, different regulatory frameworks, different payer dynamics -- that make concentric expansion far less certain than Facebook moving from Harvard to other universities.

This is a pass. The thesis is consensus. The market is contested. The founders lack visible domain depth or the kind of extreme conviction that would make me believe they see something no one else sees. The technology is an application of increasingly commoditized AI capabilities to a workflow that multiple better-funded teams are already automating. There is no secret here -- only a reasonable idea that many reasonable people already agree with, which is precisely the kind of bet that produces competition rather than monopoly.
