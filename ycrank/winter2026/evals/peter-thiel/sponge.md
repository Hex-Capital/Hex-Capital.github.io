# Sponge -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first and most damning signal. Five funded startups -- Catena Labs at $18 million, Payman AI at $14 million, Skyfire at $10 million, Natural at $10 million -- plus Coinbase's AgentKit, Visa's Intelligent Commerce, Mastercard's Agent Pay, and Stripe's own Agentic Commerce Suite, all launched or announced within the same twelve-month window, all pursuing the same thesis: AI agents need financial infrastructure. This is not a market with a secret hiding in it. This is a market where every sophisticated player on earth has arrived at the same conclusion simultaneously. When Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, Coinbase, and a16z crypto all agree that a category is important, the absence of contrarian insight is not a subtle interpretive question -- it is structural fact. The insight "autonomous agents will need wallets and payment rails" is as consensus as any thesis in technology today. Mimetic convergence of this density does not produce monopoly winners. It produces margin destruction.

The founding team's relationship to Stripe makes this worse, not better. All three founders built stablecoin financial accounts and core money movement systems at Stripe. They left to build financial infrastructure for agents. In February 2026, Stripe launched its Agentic Commerce Suite. The founders are now competing with their former employer on capabilities they helped create, using domain knowledge their former employer also possesses, in a market their former employer has explicitly entered. This is not analogous to the PayPal Mafia building in adjacent spaces -- Reid Hoffman built LinkedIn (professional identity), not a second payments company. The Sponge founders built payments infrastructure at Stripe and are building payments infrastructure outside of Stripe. The domain expertise is real and I do not question their technical competence. But competence deployed into a market where your former employer has superior distribution, existing merchant relationships, and the infrastructure you personally built is not a path to monopoly. It is a path to becoming a feature in someone else's product.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If you squint at Sponge the right way, it looks like early Stripe itself: a developer-first payments API for a new category of buyer, occupying the infrastructure layer while incumbents focus on enterprise merchants. Stripe launched its Agentic Commerce Suite targeting URBN, Etsy, and Ashley Furniture -- large merchants with consumer-facing checkout. Sponge targets the developer building an agent that needs to autonomously transact via SDK and MCP integration. If there is a structural gap between "enterprise merchant agentic commerce" and "developer-to-agent infrastructure," Sponge could own that gap the way Stripe owned the gap between enterprise payment processors and individual developers in 2011. The Gateway product -- businesses upload an API specification, agents onboard and pay autonomously with no code changes -- is a genuinely clever product concept. The fiat-plus-crypto hybrid approach is differentiated from crypto-only competitors like Skyfire and Coinbase AgentKit. For this to work, three things must be simultaneously true: agents must reach sufficient autonomy that transaction volume becomes meaningful, Stripe must structurally ignore the developer layer (which contradicts Stripe's entire founding DNA), and the fiat-plus-crypto bridge must matter enough to create switching costs. I find the conjunction of all three unlikely.

What I do not see anywhere in this dossier is a definite vision -- a specific, concrete picture of the future this company is designed to create. "Financial infrastructure for the agent economy" is a category description, not a plan. When Zuckerberg sat across from me, he could tell me exactly what Facebook would become and why he would never sell. When Musk described SpaceX, he articulated a specific physics-based argument for why reusable rockets would create a launch cost monopoly. What does Sponge believe about the world that Catena Labs, Skyfire, Natural, Payman, and Stripe all disagree with? I cannot find it. The fiat-plus-crypto feature is a product choice, not a thesis about the structure of the future. The Gateway product is a distribution mechanism, not a secret. The founders appear to be competent builders executing a consensus playbook in a crowded field -- and that is precisely the profile I avoid.

The technology itself is infrastructure plumbing -- TypeScript SDKs, spending controls, multi-chain support. These are well-executed product features, not a technological discontinuity. Nothing here is 10x better than what Stripe, Coinbase, or a well-funded competitor can build within eighteen months. The absence of proprietary technology, patents, or any capability that literally did not exist before means the company's defensibility must come from network effects or switching costs -- both of which the dossier marks as "unproven" and "inferred." A payments company without proprietary technology and without proven network effects in a market with six funded competitors and three incumbents is a company whose margins will trend toward zero. The agent payments category may produce significant aggregate transaction volume. But the question I ask is not whether the market will exist -- it is whether any single company can achieve monopoly within it. The structural answer, given the competitive density, is almost certainly no.
