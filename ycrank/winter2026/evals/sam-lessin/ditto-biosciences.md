# Ditto Biosciences -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what grabbed me immediately: three PhD scientists who spent three years together at Arcadia Science -- a startup literally built around studying non-model organisms -- are now mining parasite genomes for autoimmune drug candidates. Parasitic worms, ticks, and viruses have spent hundreds of millions of years evolving proteins specifically designed to manipulate the human immune system. Ditto's thesis is that nature already did the R&D, and they're building the computational infrastructure to systematically extract those solutions. That is a genuinely weird idea in the context of mainstream pharma drug discovery, where the default playbook is synthetic antibody engineering and known-target screening. A team of parasitologists and computational biologists proposing to replace that playbook with evolutionary biology? Most pharma VCs would furrow their brows and reach for the next antibody platform deck. The founder-idea calibration here is tight -- Adair Borges has 50+ papers and a patent on anti-CRISPR proteins from studying phage-bacteria warfare, Dennis Sun has a Harvard magna cum laude plus NSF Fellowship plus operational chops from running strategy at Arcadia, and Emily Weiss brings sequencing and microbial community expertise from her UCSD PhD. These aren't generic ML engineers who discovered biology last Tuesday. They lived inside the parasite-host interaction space for years before deciding it contained drug candidates. That's the "sane" part. The "insane" part is convincing the pharma world that tick spit contains the next blockbuster immunomodulator.

Now, here's where this company passes a test that 90% of YC companies fail: my AI kill test. If you asked me "does AI commoditize this business or strengthen it?" the answer is unambiguously the latter. Ditto uses AI to screen a million-plus parasite proteins for binding affinity and target prediction -- that's computational horsepower applied to a proprietary biological insight. Strip out the AI layer and you still have a valid scientific approach; it just runs slower and screens fewer proteins. AI is the cherry on top, not the sundae. The structural moat here is biological expertise, a proprietary database of analyzed parasite proteins, a tissue biobank under construction, and the interdisciplinary talent combination of parasitology, computational genomics, and protein engineering. Big pharma would need to build entirely new competencies in evolutionary biology and host-parasite interactions to replicate this -- that's a talent bottleneck, not a software gap. Merck doesn't have parasitologists on speed dial. This is closer in structure to Craftwork's operational moat than to any SaaS play -- the "ugliness" of the domain knowledge is the defensibility.

The bull case is genuinely compelling. Pandion Therapeutics -- novel protein therapeutics for autoimmune disease -- sold to Merck for $1.9 billion. The autoimmune market is $80+ billion and growing. If Ditto's platform systematically produces validated candidates from an entirely new source material that nobody else is mining at this scale, it becomes a discovery engine that pharma partners would pay serious money to access. Each validated candidate makes the platform more credible. The narrative arc stretches from autoimmune diseases to any immune-mediated condition to potentially any disease where evolutionary biology has already produced relevant molecular tools. That's a big canvas.

But here's my honest structural problem with this deal, and it's not about the team or the science -- it's about the category. Biotech drug development operates on timelines that fundamentally break my framework. The company itself acknowledges $15-20 million and 3-5 years just for pre-clinical work. Full development to market approval is 10-15 years. There's no "regatta model" here -- you can't tack and adjust course quickly when your feedback loops are measured in clinical trial phases. The capital requirements are enormous, which means massive dilution through successive rounds. And the outcome distribution is binary in a way I'm deeply uncomfortable with: either the drug candidates work in humans, or they don't. You can have the most beautiful platform in the world and still face a Phase 2 failure that craters everything. Compare this to my Helium investment -- yes, it took seven years from seed to unicorn, but along the way you could see hotspot deployments, network growth, and usage data providing continuous signal. With pre-clinical biotech, you're writing a check and staring into a void for years.

The "new primitive" question is the most interesting analytical tension. Is Ditto building a protocol -- a systematic platform for mining evolutionary biology that becomes infrastructure for the pharma industry? Or is it building a pipeline company that happens to source candidates from a novel place? If it's the former, you get compounding dynamics as each validated candidate strengthens the platform's credibility and attracts more partnership interest. If it's the latter, you have a conventional biotech with an unusual sourcing method and all the binary risk that implies. The dossier suggests the founders are thinking about both -- internal pipeline development plus platform partnerships -- but biotech economics almost always collapse toward pipeline monetization because that's where the dollars are. I don't see the protocol-layer lock-in that would make this an infrastructure investment. It's a proprietary asset, not a standard that others build on.

I respect this team enormously. The founder-market fit is among the best I've seen at pre-seed -- three scientists who collaborated for three years in exactly the scientific territory their company now mines, with publication records and patents proving they can generate IP. If I were a biotech-focused investor, this would be high on my list. But I'm not, and my framework is structurally mismatched with the biotech category. The timelines are too long, the outcomes too binary, the iteration cycles too slow, and the primitive/protocol dynamics too weak. This is a good company in a category I don't invest in, not a bad company in a category I do.
