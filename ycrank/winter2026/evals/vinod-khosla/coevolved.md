# Coevolved -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The pivot tells me everything. This team built a general-purpose multi-agent orchestration framework -- ambitious, horizontal, the kind of infrastructure play that could have been foundational. Then they archived it in January 2026 and narrowed to automating mortgage paperwork. That trajectory -- from broad to narrow, from platform to vertical workflow tool -- is the opposite of what I fund. It signals founders who encountered the difficulty of building something big and retreated to something manageable. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu didn't pivot from building a general-purpose networking stack to optimizing Cisco's existing router firmware. He went after the whole architecture. The direction of a pivot reveals ambition more reliably than any pitch deck, and this one points toward de-risking.

Let me ask the question I always ask first: if Coevolved succeeds completely -- if they automate 75% of mortgage document chasing, if every lender in America uses their platform -- what changes? Loan officers fill out fewer forms. Origination costs drop from $10,000 to maybe $5,000 per loan. Cycle times shrink. That is a perfectly fine business outcome in a $2.3 billion software market. But nobody's life fundamentally changes. The mortgage system still works the same way. The same banks lend to the same borrowers under the same terms through the same channels. You've made an existing machine run slightly faster. When I compare this to what Square did -- not just speeding up payment processing but giving millions of businesses access to card payments for the first time, restructuring who could participate in the economy -- the difference in consequence magnitude is stark. Coevolved's ceiling, even in the best case, is a solid vertical SaaS company, not an industry transformation.

The bull case deserves honest examination. The timing is real: LLMs crossed a document-understanding threshold in 2023-2025, origination costs are stubbornly above $10,000 per loan, and incumbents like Blend (down catastrophically from its IPO) have proven that digitizing workflows without genuine AI is insufficient. There's a window for a startup that truly nails agentic automation in mortgage to build switching costs and a data flywheel before Blend or ICE Mortgage Technology retrofits their architectures. And Athan Zhang is clearly talented -- Princeton CS, NLP research under Danqi Chen, raised $1.2 million for a prior medtech startup at what appears to be age 20-21. These are not mediocre founders. But talent calibrated to a small problem is worse than naive ambition pointed at a massive one. I've backed people with far less polish who were attacking problems that mattered at civilizational scale.

What concerns me beyond the ambition question is the structural position. The dossier itself flags the core vulnerability: document OCR, data extraction, form auto-fill, and anomaly detection are individually available from horizontal AI platforms like Ocrolus. The integrated mortgage-specific orchestration layer is the claimed differentiator, but orchestrating commodity components in a vertical doesn't create durable advantage -- it creates a feature that well-funded incumbents can replicate. Tavant already powers one in three U.S. mortgage loans. Blend has $685 million in funding and existing lender relationships. When I look at my framework for technology disruption, I ask whether the startup's approach makes the incumbent system structurally obsolete. Coevolved makes the incumbent system work better. That's the wrong side of the disruption line.

I also note that neither founder has any documented experience in mortgage lending, financial services compliance, or regulated industries. Normally I celebrate outsiders -- I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab precisely because he wasn't from aerospace. But the outsider advantage compounds only when you're reimagining the system from first principles. Beck didn't optimize NASA's existing rocket procurement process; he built an entirely new launch vehicle and business model. Coevolved's founders are outsiders who are automating the existing mortgage workflow rather than reimagining mortgage finance itself. That gives them the outsider's disadvantage -- no lender relationships, no regulatory intuition, no compliance muscle memory in an industry governed by TRID, ECOA, Fair Housing Act, and state-by-state licensing -- without the outsider's advantage of radical reimagination. Two computer science graduates, not hiring, building AI underwriting agents in one of the most regulated corners of financial services. The gene pool doesn't address the venture's most critical risk.

I pass. These are smart founders who should be working on something where the consequence of their success matches their capability. A problem where, if they win, the world operates fundamentally differently -- not one where loan officers save three hours per application.
