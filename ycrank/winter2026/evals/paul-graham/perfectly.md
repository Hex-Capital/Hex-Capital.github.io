# Perfectly -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Here's the thing about recruiting: everyone who has ever hired someone knows agencies are broken. That's precisely the problem. When I talk about schlep blindness -- the unconscious avoidance of hard problems that keeps good ideas invisible -- recruiting is the opposite case. It's a problem that's fully visible, widely acknowledged, and being attacked by over a hundred funded startups right now. The Perfectly founders sat through 800+ agency-sourced interviews at TikTok and experienced the pain firsthand. I don't doubt they felt it. But so did every hiring manager at every growing tech company in the last decade, and a meaningful fraction of them are now building AI recruiting tools. When the schlep isn't unconscious avoidance but conscious consensus, the organic backstory loses its protective moat. Stripe worked because for ten years nobody wanted to deal with banks and PCI compliance. Perfectly is entering a market where Perfect raised $23M, Alex raised $20M, Gem has $148M, and Dover has Tiger Global money -- all building some version of the same thing.

That said, I want to be precise about what these founders got right. The 800+ interviews isn't just "we used recruiting agencies once." That's a quantified, deep exposure to the failure modes of the existing system -- information loss at handoffs, misaligned candidate matching, slow iteration. Both founders overlapped at TikTok, which means the co-founder relationship predates the startup. And their technical backgrounds -- ML Scientist at TikTok, Senior MLE at Meta, a NeurIPS publication on vision-language reasoning -- map directly to the core technical problem of candidate-job matching. TikTok built perhaps the most effective recommendation algorithm in consumer technology. If that expertise transfers to matching candidates to jobs, there's a real technical advantage buried in these resumes.

The commission model is the most interesting strategic choice in the dossier, and it cuts both ways. By charging only on successful placements, Perfectly aligns its incentives with the customer in a way that SaaS competitors like Gem and Dover don't. You don't pay unless we deliver someone worth hiring -- that's a strong pitch to a skeptical buyer. It's also the harder business model to scale. SaaS revenue recurs regardless of placement outcomes; commission revenue is lumpy and depends on conversion quality. If the AI screening generates false positives -- candidates who pass the automated screen but fail human interviews -- Perfectly absorbs the cost with no revenue. At scale, this model works beautifully. Getting to scale is the problem.

The bull case for Perfectly requires believing two things: first, that recommendation system expertise from TikTok and Meta translates into materially better candidate matching than what competitors can build with the same foundation models; and second, that the agency model creates a wedge that SaaS tools can't replicate, because paying per placement is what budget-constrained companies actually want. If both are true, Perfectly could eat contingency recruiting from the bottom up -- cheaper, faster, better-aligned. The data flywheel of reusable candidate screens is a genuine network effect if it compounds. And the "why now" timing is real: LLM costs dropped enough in 2024-2025 to make automated outreach and screening economically viable at scale. This isn't implausible. It's just that I count at least five well-funded teams making essentially the same bet.

Where I struggle is on the resourcefulness dimension. I have no evidence of these founders navigating adversity, pivoting when something didn't work, or inventing creative solutions to unexpected obstacles. Their backgrounds are impressive but linear -- strong ML roles at top companies, graduate degrees, published research. That's competence, which matters. But in a market this crowded, competence is table stakes. What separates the winner from the other ninety-nine AI recruiting startups is the team that does something nobody expected when the obvious path gets blocked. I see nothing in the dossier that tells me what happens when Perfectly's outreach emails start getting filtered as spam, or when Perfect.com's $23M buys them the same enterprise contracts, or when a recession cuts hiring volume by 40%. The cereal box test -- what creative, unexpected thing would these founders do when everything goes wrong -- I can't answer that yet.

I wouldn't invest my own money here. The organic discovery is genuine, and the technical founders are strong. But the absence of schlep blindness in this market means organic origin doesn't translate to structural advantage. When a hundred teams see the same problem and attack it simultaneously, the question shifts from "did you discover this authentically?" to "why will you specifically win a knife fight?" I don't have a convincing answer from this dossier. The founders may well be the ones who win -- their ML pedigree is top-tier -- but at this stage, the signal-to-noise ratio in AI recruiting is too low for me to separate them from the field.
