# Overshoot -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive dynamics here are the first thing I notice, and they're the central question. Overshoot is building specialized video inference infrastructure in a market where Fireworks AI has raised $331M, Together AI has raised $534M, and Replicate was just absorbed by Cloudflare. These platforms already serve vision models. Adding video-streaming optimization is a feature priority for them, not a company to build. When I evaluate whether an infrastructure company can survive against incumbents with 100-500x more capital, I need to see either a structural moat that scales with time or a distribution wedge that creates compounding switching costs. I see neither here. The SDK integration is described as "3 lines of code" -- that's great developer experience, but it also means a competitor can offer a drop-in replacement. The underlying VLMs (Qwen3-VL, InternVL) are open-source models Overshoot doesn't control. The claimed differentiation is "focus" on codec, streaming protocols, and inference engine optimization for video specifically. Focus is a strategy, not a moat.

The structural moment is real but symmetrical. Open-source VLMs crossed a production-quality threshold in 2024-2025, enabling real-time video understanding that wasn't previously feasible. That's a genuine capability inflection -- similar in kind to the GPT-3-to-GPT-4 jump that made legal AI viable. But here's the critical difference from my Harvey investment: Harvey was building workflow, enterprise trust, and domain-specific fine-tuning ahead of the capability curve, so when GPT-4 shipped, Harvey had compounding advantages that a new entrant couldn't replicate. Overshoot's value proposition is primarily latency optimization at the inference layer. The VLM capability threshold benefits every inference platform equally. There's no asymmetric positioning here -- Overshoot isn't accumulating proprietary data, building domain-specific workflows, or creating enterprise relationships that compound over time. They're optimizing throughput on models anyone can run.

The founders deserve more than this market structure gives them. Zakaria built low-latency surge pricing systems at Uber for seven years and wrote GPU kernels at Meta AI -- that's exactly the background you'd want for inference optimization. Younes was a founding engineer at COSMONiO, where he built a computer vision training and serving platform from scratch before Intel acquired the company in 2020. The domain fit between these two founders and this specific problem is unusually precise for a pre-seed team. They've shipped a working API, a JavaScript SDK, a developer playground, and documentation -- and their first public API access at the NexHacks hackathon in January 2025 shows they're moving from closed beta to developer acquisition. That's solid execution velocity for a two-person team. But strong founders in a structurally disadvantaged market position is a pattern I've seen before, and the market usually wins.

The strongest bull case: "video agents" -- autonomous systems interpreting live video feeds for robotics, physical security, gaming, and consumer products -- could become a major application category over the next three to five years. If they do, specialized inference infrastructure for real-time video could be the category equivalent of what Stripe built for payments: the default developer integration that every application flows through. Real-time video processing genuinely differs from text inference at the infrastructure level -- codec handling, frame extraction, streaming protocol management, and multi-frame temporal understanding require specialized engineering that general-purpose platforms may perpetually underinvest in. If Overshoot can establish itself as the canonical developer platform for video AI before the large inference providers prioritize this sub-segment, the switching costs from production integrations could create defensibility that the thin SDK alone doesn't suggest. The 300+ developers on the platform, while modest, represent early signal in what could be a much larger adoption curve. For this bull case to materialize, though, Overshoot needs the "video agents" category to grow faster than the large inference platforms' ability to add video-specific optimizations -- and that's a race against well-capitalized competitors with strong engineering teams.

What I keep coming back to is the product-to-distribution question. Stripe didn't win because its API was faster -- it won because the payment integration became a distribution channel for Atlas, Billing, Radar, and Treasury. Where is Overshoot's multi-product trajectory? A video inference API is a single product with consumption-based pricing. I don't see evidence that the founders have articulated how their initial developer relationship expands into adjacent products -- video annotation tools, model fine-tuning, edge deployment, monitoring dashboards. Without that expansion path, this is a performance optimization layer, not a platform company. And performance optimization layers get commoditized. The computer vision market TAM numbers cited ($19.82B growing to $58.29B) are the kind of static analysis I specifically warn against -- what matters is the size of the specific sub-segment (real-time VLM inference on live video streams), which is unquantified and could be either massive or a niche within a niche.

This is a pass for me. The founders are strong and the timing on VLMs is correct, but the market structure favors incumbents, the distribution trajectory is underdeveloped, and the differentiation rests on performance optimization that better-funded teams can replicate. I'd revisit if Overshoot demonstrates that real-time video inference requires fundamentally different infrastructure from general-purpose inference -- not just faster, but architecturally distinct in ways that general platforms can't easily absorb.
