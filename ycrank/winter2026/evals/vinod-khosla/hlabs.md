# Hlabs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking feature of HLabs is the gap between the magnitude of its narrative and the mechanics of its business. "Making an industrial supply chain for building robots in the USA" sounds like it could be a reshoring play at civilization scale -- the kind of infrastructure problem that underpins an entire technological revolution. But when I look at what actually exists, I see a solo founder selling a $35 open-source motor controller board into a market where ODrive, moteus, and a dozen Chinese manufacturers already compete. The distance between "becoming the domestic backbone of American robotics" and "shipping actuator control boards at $35 with open-source firmware" is not a visionary gap that ambition will close -- it's a capital-intensity and execution chasm that a single person cannot bridge with option-value investing. This is a manufacturing scale-up play, and those require patient industrial capital, not the kind of bets I make.

Let me be direct about consequence magnitude. If HLabs fully succeeds -- captures significant domestic market share, expands the product line to a full integrated ecosystem, becomes the default component supplier for U.S. robotics companies and defense contractors -- what changes? America has a reliable domestic source for motor controllers and robot primitives. That's useful. That's a real business. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The incumbent approach to building robots doesn't get disrupted -- it gets slightly easier and cheaper for American teams. Compare this to what keeps me up at night: fusion energy replacing fossil fuels, AI systems replacing 80% of what doctors do, plant-based proteins eliminating animal agriculture. HLabs at maximum ambition is a supply chain optimization story, not an industry transformation story. Component suppliers serve revolutions; they rarely create them. Intel was an exception, but Intel had a technology monopoly protected by billions in fab investment and architectural lock-in. HLabs has open-source firmware at $35 per board.

The deeper structural problem I notice -- and this is where my KiOR scars throb -- is that the entire value proposition is anchored to a policy decision. The 145% tariff on Chinese imports is the structural moat. Remove it, and a $35 board from Austin competes directly against a $5 board from Shenzhen with equivalent open-source firmware. I lost $160 million of my own money on KiOR partly because the investment thesis depended on oil reaching $150-200 per barrel -- a macro assumption, not a technology moat. Technology moats persist regardless of who sits in the White House. Tariff moats are one executive order from evaporating. When a startup's defensibility depends on government policy rather than fundamental technology advantage, I'm not investing in innovation -- I'm making a political bet. That's not my game.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Robotics startups raised $2.26 billion in Q1 2026 alone. Every one of those companies needs actuators, controllers, and electronics. Forty companies ordering in four months from launch is a genuine demand signal -- it shows the pain point is real and immediate. If Paul Hetherington can execute the product roadmap -- control boards, then Nvidia Jetson mainboards, then cameras, then wireless modules -- the integrated ecosystem creates switching costs that compound over time. Defense procurement restrictions on foreign-sourced components provide a protected market segment. The timing convergence of tariffs, robotics investment boom, and CHIPS Act reshoring incentives is genuinely favorable. For this to be a transformational investment, HLabs would need to become to robotics what Nvidia became to AI: the infrastructure layer that captures value because every builder depends on it. That requires proprietary technology differentiation and massive scale -- neither of which exists today, and neither of which the open-source, low-margin, solo-founder structure is designed to produce.

Paul Hetherington has the right technical background -- integrated mechanical and electrical engineering, embedded systems research, six years running a YC-backed company. He's clearly capable and building with his hands, which I respect. But his prior company Mystic AI wound down without a clear exit after six years, and his current approach isn't contrarian in the way I look for. Building domestic manufacturing capacity during a tariff regime is sensible -- it's what any rational actor would do. The experts and incumbents wouldn't dismiss this idea; they'd nod approvingly. When Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in telecom would never happen, that was the signal. When defense procurement officers and reshoring advocates validate your thesis, you're swimming with the current, not against it. Swimming with the current means the opportunity is real but the returns are competed away.

The hardware scale challenge with a solo founder is the final concern. This isn't a software company where one person can build and iterate. Manufacturing supply chain, quality assurance, PCB design, firmware development, customer support, sales, procurement -- these are parallel workstreams that require bodies. Building four new product categories in Q1 2026 with one person isn't ambitious, it's physically impossible at any quality standard. Hardware companies at this stage need at minimum a co-founder who addresses a complementary risk -- manufacturing operations, or defense sales, or supply chain logistics. The gene pool is a single gene.
