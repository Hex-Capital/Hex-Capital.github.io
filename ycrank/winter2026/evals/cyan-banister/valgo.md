# Valgo -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that strikes me immediately about Valgo: these two founders literally wrote the textbook. Not metaphorically -- they co-authored the actual MIT Press textbook on algorithmic safety validation, they teach the Stanford course, and they were on the team that built the FAA-certified collision avoidance system that became an international standard. If you were casting a movie about "the most qualified people alive to build this exact company," you'd cast Robert Moss and Sydney Katz. And that's precisely what gives me pause. Because in my experience, the most credentialed, most obvious founders building the most legible product in a market that every sophisticated investor already understands -- that's consensus investing. And consensus-based investing is very different from conviction-based investing.

When I sit down with founders, I don't start with the product. I want to hear how they got to where they are -- the real story, not the LinkedIn version. And with Moss and Katz, what I see is an elite academic pipeline: top universities, prestigious government labs, Stanford PhDs under the same world-class advisor, then a startup that does exactly what their dissertations described. Every step follows logically from the last. There's no detour through hardship, no moment where the world told them they were crazy and they kept going anyway. That's not a criticism of them as people -- I have enormous respect for their intellectual commitment to safety. But the biographical signal I look for, the one that tells me a founder will survive the company's worst day, comes from having already survived something that wasn't in the plan. I don't see that thread here. Their personal stake is intellectual and career-based, not forged in the kind of adversity that produces the relentlessness I weight most heavily.

The weirdness factor is essentially zero. Two Stanford PhDs building enterprise safety validation tools for autonomous systems? Every defense-tech fund, every deep-tech seed investor, every autonomy-focused VC will immediately grasp this opportunity. Applied Intuition just raised at a $15 billion valuation, which means the category is validated and the market is legible. The round won't be unpopular or hard to assess -- it'll be well-understood and likely competitive. That's the opposite of where I find my best returns. The companies I've backed that became defining investments -- SpaceX when private space was absurd, Uber when ride-sharing was illegal, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a joke -- all shared the quality of making smart people uncomfortable. Valgo makes smart people nod approvingly.

Now, the strongest bull case deserves real engagement, because it's genuinely compelling. If you believe -- and you should -- that autonomy is expanding from automotive into aviation, defense, robotics, and space, and that every one of those domains requires formal safety validation before regulators will certify these systems, then Valgo is positioned at an infrastructure inflection point. Their black-box, simulator-agnostic approach means they're not competing with Applied Intuition's full-stack environment; they're the validation layer that works on top of whatever simulator the customer already uses. That's an elegant wedge. Their ACAS X pedigree gives them credibility with FAA and DoD that money literally cannot buy -- it takes years of embedded work with these institutions. And the regulatory moats in aviation and defense are exactly the kind of complexity I've seen create durable competitive advantages, from Anduril to IronPort. If Moss and Katz focus ruthlessly on aviation or defense as a beachhead rather than spreading across seven industries simultaneously, this could become the standard validation layer for safety-critical autonomy. That path is real.

Where this falls short for me is on economic access and real-world impact for the populations I care about. This is enterprise tooling sold to companies that already have significant resources -- autonomous vehicle companies, defense contractors, aviation OEMs. Making those systems safer before deployment is genuinely important, and I don't dismiss it. But it's not creating economic opportunity for underserved communities. It's not making an invisible system visible to everyday people the way Carta made equity transparent or Affirm made interest rates honest. The impact is real but indirect, flowing through corporate safety teams rather than reaching the people most affected by economic exclusion.

The co-founder dynamic is worth noting. Moss and Katz have collaborated for years across MIT Lincoln Lab, Stanford, a textbook, and a course -- that's meaningful. But all of that collaboration happened in academic settings where the failure modes are different from startup failure modes. I learned from HQ Trivia that even the best product with perfect timing can't survive co-founder conflict, and I learned from GameCrush that you can see warning signs and still invest because the concept is novel enough to override your judgment. Here, I see no warning signs, but I also see no evidence of how these founders handle the kind of disagreements that startups produce -- equity negotiations, firing decisions, pivots under financial pressure, the loneliness of building something when nobody's buying. I'd want to hear that story directly before forming a view.

This is a company I'd expect to do well. The founders are exceptional for this problem, the market timing is right, and the regulatory expertise is genuine. But it's not my kind of bet. It's a consensus investment for investors who prioritize credentialed founder-market fit in legible categories. For someone who's looking for misfits and free-thinking people building things that make everyone else uncomfortable -- that's not what I feel here.
