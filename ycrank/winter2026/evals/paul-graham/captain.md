# Captain -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Captain is that it's in one of the most consensus categories in tech right now. RAG infrastructure. Every VC in San Francisco is excited about retrieval-augmented generation. Vectara has raised $73.5M. Contextual AI has $100M, with Bezos and NVIDIA backing them. Pinecone sits at $138M and a $750M valuation. When I see two college students from Purdue entering a market with four well-funded competitors who've collectively raised over $350M, the question isn't whether the problem is real. The problem is obviously real. The question is why this team wins when the entire industry has already converged on the same insight. I said in 2025 that the most impressive YC companies I'd seen were not working on AI. That wasn't a prediction about AI being unimportant. It was an observation that in consensus categories, the upside gets priced away by competition.

But before I dismiss this, I need to look at the organic thread. Edgar Babajanyan has three years of production RAG pipeline experience and built an internal solution for Boar's Head -- which now appears as a customer logo on Captain's website. That's a real origin story. He didn't read about RAG in a blog post and decide to build a startup. He was actually building these systems, hitting the walls, and realizing the tooling was broken. Lewis Polansky was studying accuracy and verification algorithms for LLMs and had prior work on hallucination problems. The cofounders met at Purdue, which means the relationship predates the company -- that's something I always want to see. The path from "I built this for one enterprise customer" to "I should make this available to everyone" is the same path many good B2B infrastructure companies follow. It's how the best developer tools get born: someone builds something internally, realizes the abstraction is valuable, and productizes it.

The schlep here is also genuine and worth acknowledging. Enterprise document ingestion is ugly work. OCR on complex PDFs with tables and images. Connecting to 1,000+ data sources -- S3, SharePoint, Confluence, Slack, Google Drive. Getting SOC 2 Type II certified with independent penetration testing. Two undergrads achieving SOC 2 compliance is not trivial; that's organizational maturity that belies their age. The enterprise data plumbing that Captain handles is exactly the kind of work most AI startups don't want to do. They want to work on the model layer, the clever prompting, the agent architecture. Nobody dreams of building SharePoint connectors. That's schlep, and schlep creates a real if modest barrier. The problem is that this schlep isn't unique to Captain -- every competitor in this space has to navigate it too, and some have much more engineering firepower to throw at it.

The bull case I have to honestly engage with: if those enterprise logos represent real paying customers, two college students landing Sony and IEEE is extraordinary. That would be genuine pull that no amount of marketing can fake. The Garry Tan endorsement -- "Captain is a step function increase vs existing RAG pipelines" -- from the YC CEO is a strong credibility signal. If the 95% accuracy claim holds under scrutiny, that's a real wedge. And the API-first, developer-tool positioning is exactly the kind of company I tend to gravitate toward: picks-and-shovels for other builders, similar in shape to early Stripe abstracting away payment infrastructure. If you squint, "give me your API key and I'll replace your entire RAG pipeline" has some of that "Collison installation" energy. The founders are young, but Drew Houston was 24 when he started Dropbox. Youth isn't disqualifying.

What keeps me from getting excited is the category dynamics. This isn't a problem hiding in plain sight due to schlep blindness. This is a problem the entire industry sees clearly and is pouring hundreds of millions into solving. Stripe worked partly because in 2010, nobody else wanted to deal with banks and PCI compliance -- the Collisons had the field nearly to themselves for the critical early years. Captain has no such breathing room. Contextual AI, Vectara, and deepset are all building comparable managed retrieval products right now. And the technology itself -- embedding models, vector search, reranking -- is improving rapidly in open source through LlamaIndex and LangChain. The distributed parallel LLM map-reduction approach is an interesting technical differentiator, but it's the kind of architectural choice that a well-funded competitor could replicate in a quarter. Meanwhile, AWS, Google, and Microsoft are all building managed RAG components into their cloud platforms. When the incumbents are moving toward you and the startups ahead of you have 50x your capital, the window for a two-person pre-seed team to establish a durable position is narrow.

I also can't fully evaluate the founders on the relentlessly resourceful dimension. They're clearly smart and capable for their age -- Edgar's production experience is real, Lewis's varied startup experiments show initiative. But I haven't seen them survive a crucible. No failed company they came back from. No moment where the plan fell apart and they invented something creative to survive. That's not disqualifying at pre-seed -- most founders haven't faced that test yet. But in a category this competitive, I need stronger conviction in the team to override my concerns about the market structure.

Captain is a competent team building a real product in a real market with some organic discovery behind it. But it's a consensus bet in a crowded field, and when I'm investing my own money, I want either a problem nobody else sees or founders I'm certain will find a way through no matter what. I see partial signals of both, but not enough of either. This is a pass -- not because the founders aren't good, but because the competitive landscape requires either a dramatically larger technical moat or dramatically stronger evidence of relentless resourcefulness than what's visible today.
