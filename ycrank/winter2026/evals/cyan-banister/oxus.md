# Oxus -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that strikes me first about Oxus: this is one of the least contrarian spaces in enterprise software right now. AI for audit and compliance has become a consensus category almost overnight. AuditBoard was acquired for over $3 billion. Fieldguide just raised $125 million at a $700 million valuation. Another YC company, Denki, is attacking the same problem from a services angle. Workiva is a public company doing $739 million in revenue. When I look at a landscape like that, my instinct isn't excitement -- it's caution. The best investments I've made were the ones nobody else wanted to make. SpaceX when people thought private rocketry was lunacy. Uber when ride-sharing was illegal. Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a fever dream. SOX compliance automation in 2026? Everyone sees this. The weirdness has been completely arbitraged away, and that's a signal I can't ignore.

My first question is always about the founders' stories -- not the business, the people. And what I find in this dossier is a team with immaculate institutional credentials: Federal Reserve, D.E. Shaw, JPMorgan, BCG, all three from MIT with overlapping degrees in CS, economics, data science, and finance. These are impressive resumes. But resumes aren't what I invest in. I'm looking for the biographical thread that tells me this founder will keep going when the company is on fire, when the enterprise deal falls through, when the competitor with $125 million in the bank comes for their customers. I need to understand what personal experience forged their commitment to internal audit specifically. Was one of them an auditor who felt crushed by the busywork? Did someone watch their company get hammered by a material weakness finding? The dossier doesn't surface anything like that. There's one genuinely interesting detail buried in Christine Watts's background -- she may be the first person from Tajikistan to get into YC, reportedly at age 19 as a solo founder. If true, that's a real outsider story, the kind of origin that makes me lean in. But it's unconfirmed in the dossier, and even granting it, I don't see how growing up in Central Asia connects to a burning need to automate SOX workpapers. The company name "Oxus" -- the ancient name for the Amu Darya -- might be a nod to that heritage, which I find genuinely charming. But charm isn't conviction.

Let me steelman this, because I want to be honest about the bull case. SOX compliance is mandatory for every public company in the United States. That's roughly 4,000-5,000 companies that legally must do this work every year, with no opt-out. The CPA talent shortage is real -- 75% of CPAs projected to retire in the next decade. Incumbents like AuditBoard and Workiva were built before LLMs existed and face the classic innovator's dilemma: they can't cannibalize their workflow-management products to build genuinely AI-native audit automation. The "tool-for-teams" positioning is shrewd -- it's less threatening to in-house audit departments than Denki's replacement model, which means easier initial adoption. And the founders' institutional pedigrees give them credibility with the exact buyers they need to reach: CFOs, Chief Audit Executives, heads of internal controls at public companies. If Janet and Melinda Liu are sisters -- the dossier can't confirm it, but they share a surname and identical MIT degrees -- that would actually map to my preference for family-run founding teams with organic conflict resolution. There's a version of this story where they execute crisply, land a few marquee enterprise customers through YC connections, build genuine switching costs through annual audit cycles, and create a real business.

But even granting all of that, I keep coming back to what's missing from my perspective. This is efficiency tooling for well-compensated professionals at large companies. Nobody who's underserved is being lifted up here. No invisible system is being made visible to people who currently can't see it -- the audit professionals already understand SOX; they just want to do the paperwork faster. When I backed Uber, I saw a company that would create income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. When I backed Affirm, I saw transparent credit replacing predatory hidden fees. When I backed Carta, I saw equity ownership becoming legible to employees who had no idea what their shares were worth. Oxus is making auditors more productive, which is fine, but it doesn't create the kind of economic access that gets me out of bed in the morning. And without that biographical grit connecting founders to problem, without the contrarian weirdness that signals an insight nobody else has reached, and without an impact story that resonates with how I think about capitalism as a vehicle for lifting people up -- I don't feel the jolt. This is a competent team in a real market executing a reasonable plan. But that's not enough for me to write a check from my own money.

The co-founder dynamics are a question mark rather than a red flag. Three MIT contemporaries with complementary roles (CEO, COO, CTO) and overlapping academic backgrounds suggest they chose each other deliberately. But I can't see how they handle conflict, and in a space this competitive, with Fieldguide's $125 million and AuditBoard's enterprise relationships bearing down on them, they're going to face serious pressure. I'd need to sit with these founders and hear them describe a time they fundamentally disagreed and how they worked through it before I could get comfortable.
