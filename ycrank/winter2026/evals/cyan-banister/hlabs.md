# Hlabs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with HLabs: robotics is the hottest category in venture right now. Over two billion dollars poured into robotics startups in a single quarter. Everyone and their dog knows that tariffs have made Chinese components expensive and that someone should build the U.S. supply chain alternative. That's not a secret — it's the obvious conclusion that any investor scanning headlines would reach. And when I look at Paul Hetherington's trajectory, I see a founder who ran an ML deployment platform for six years, watched it wind down, and then pivoted into the hottest hardware category at precisely the moment the macro tailwinds were screaming "do this." I don't know Paul personally, and I don't have his story — the dossier doesn't give me one. What drove him from serverless ML APIs to soldering actuator control boards in Austin? Where's the biographical thread that tells me this is the person who was always going to build this, who couldn't not build this? I can see that he's technically gifted — his MEng in integrated mechanical and electrical engineering, his embedded systems research, his hands-on PCB design posts on X. But technical capability and personal destiny are different things. When I backed the Crusoe team, they hadn't pivoted from an unrelated software company into energy infrastructure because the policy winds shifted. They'd independently arrived at an insight about waste gas and computation that was grounded in something they'd been thinking about obsessively. I need that signal here and I can't find it.

The tariff angle is real — 145% on Chinese imports tripling the cost of humanoid robots is a genuine structural shift — but it's also fragile in a way that makes me uncomfortable. This isn't physics. It's not a permanent insight about how the world works. It's a policy decision that could reverse with the next trade negotiation or administration. When I invested in SpaceX, the opportunity was rooted in the laws of orbital mechanics and the declining cost curves of reusable rocketry — those don't get repealed by executive order. Building an entire company's value proposition on tariff protection means you're one diplomatic handshake away from your moat disappearing. And frankly, the U.S. manufacturing angle isn't contrarian — it's practically a government talking point right now with the CHIPS Act and reshoring incentives everywhere.

Now, let me be honest about the bull case, because there's a version of this that's genuinely exciting. Forty robotics companies ordering within four months of launch is a meaningful signal for a solo hardware founder. The product roadmap — control boards expanding to main boards, cameras, wireless modules — has the shape of a platform play, and if HLabs becomes the default component ecosystem that every U.S. robotics startup builds on, the switching costs compound beautifully. Paul's $35 price point is aggressive and developer-friendly, and the open-source firmware creates a community acquisition funnel that could be powerful. If the defense customer angle materializes — and ITAR restrictions on foreign-sourced electronics are real and durable, not policy-dependent like tariffs — there's a genuinely defensible wedge there. This could be the picks-and-shovels play for the robotics gold rush, and picks-and-shovels businesses have historically been some of the best investments in any boom. I've backed infrastructure at inflection points before. But the infrastructure bets I've made — SpaceX, Anduril, Crusoe — all had founders whose biographical commitment to the problem was visceral and unmistakable. That's what's missing here.

The solo founder dimension concerns me specifically because this is hardware. I've seen what hardware scaling requires — concurrent execution across PCB design, firmware, manufacturing relationships, quality assurance, supply chain logistics, customer support, and sales. One person shipping a $35 control board to 40 early customers is heroic. One person trying to simultaneously launch four new product categories while managing manufacturing quality at scale is a different challenge entirely. This isn't a co-founder conflict risk — my HQ Trivia lesson doesn't apply in that direction. But the flip side of no co-founder conflict is no co-founder resilience. When the inevitable hardware crisis hits — a manufacturing defect, a supply chain disruption, a customer emergency — who's holding the other end of the rope?

I'd want to sit across from Paul and hear his story before making a final call. Maybe there's a deeply personal thread connecting him to this work that the dossier simply didn't capture. But based on what I can see, this looks like a capable engineer making a smart, well-timed bet in a consensus category — and that's almost the opposite of what I'm drawn to. The most promising companies are not popular, and right now, "build robotics infrastructure in America" is very popular indeed.
