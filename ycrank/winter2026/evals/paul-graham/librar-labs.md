# Librar Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Librar Labs is how perfectly it fits the schlep blindness pattern -- and how that coexists with real questions about whether the founders can execute at the level the opportunity demands. Library management software for schools. If you were brainstorming startup ideas, you would never land here. Your brain would skip right past it to something involving AI agents or developer tools. That's exactly the unconscious filtering I wrote about in "Schlep Blindness" -- the problem is obvious (98% of schools have no library system), the pain is real (cataloging books is tedious, manual, and thankless), and almost nobody in tech wants to deal with school procurement, physical book inventories, and institutional bureaucracy. The fact that the dominant incumbent, Follett Destiny, makes $378 million a year selling what is essentially 1990s barcode-scanning software tells you there's money here that nobody in Silicon Valley has bothered to chase.

The organic origin is genuine. One of the founders -- Kaan Sirin, described as "chief librarian" on their YC page -- actually worked as a librarian. The launch post says he "saw the day-to-day challenges firsthand." This isn't a team that read a McKinsey report about the education technology market and reverse-engineered a company. They watched librarians photograph book spines with their phones and manually type catalog entries, and thought: a computer vision model could do this automatically. That's how good startup ideas are supposed to emerge -- from direct contact with a broken process, not from a brainstorming session. The schlep underneath is substantial too: school procurement cycles, compliance requirements (they already have ISO 27001 and GDPR), curriculum integration, and the messy physical reality of damaged spines, poor lighting, and multilingual collections. This is exactly the kind of ugly, tedious work that creates natural barriers to competition.

What gives me pause is the founding team's track record. Jonathan Görtz appears to be about 20 years old, and his prior ventures -- Cyberboost, Gymbro AI -- each lasted less than a year. That's not necessarily damning at his age; I funded Reddit when Steve Huffman was 22. But there's a difference between short-lived ventures that taught you something and a pattern of jumping between ideas. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson built Ungdomsförmedlingen to 40,000+ members, which is a more meaningful signal of execution ability. The "AI-researchers" claim on their about page isn't backed by any visible publications, GitHub activity, or technical credentials I can verify. Someone clearly built a working computer vision system -- 300 schools are using it -- but I can't tell who on the team has the deep technical chops, and that matters when your entire value proposition depends on the accuracy of a specialized CV model.

The traction is the strongest signal in this dossier. Three hundred schools and 60% penetration of Swedish single-site private schools within three months is real adoption, not vaporware. Schools are institutional buyers with procurement processes -- getting 300 of them to use anything in a few months suggests genuine pull rather than marketing. If I were evaluating this at a YC interview, that number would make me lean forward. The question is whether Swedish private schools are representative of the broader market or whether the founders' local network created an artificially easy beachhead. Sweden has about 800 independent schools total. Getting most of the single-site private ones is impressive but doesn't tell me much about cracking U.S. school districts, where Follett has decades of entrenched relationships and procurement teams have approved vendor lists.

The bull case would require believing three things. First, that the "intelligence layer for the physical world" tagline hints at a real expansion plan -- libraries are just the wedge, and the computer vision technology generalizes to other physical inventory problems (retail, warehouses, archives). Second, that the founders' youth and energy compensate for their thin track records, the way it did for the Reddit founders. Third, that the incumbent is genuinely trapped by its own business model -- Follett can't adopt camera-based cataloging without cannibalizing its barcode-scanner revenue, creating the classic innovator's dilemma. If all three are true, this could be a company that dominates a niche and then expands outward. The computer vision moat could compound: every school that scans shelves adds training data that makes the model better, which attracts more schools. That's a real flywheel.

But I'm not there yet. The market is small enough that even domination might not produce venture-scale returns. The founders haven't demonstrated the kind of resourcefulness under pressure that separates companies that survive from companies that don't -- I see no evidence of a crucible moment, no creative hack born of desperation. And the technical depth of the team remains opaque. I want to see who actually built the CV model, what their background is, and whether this team can navigate the brutal reality of U.S. school district sales. This is a company with a genuinely organic idea attacking a real schlep, wrapped in a team I'm not yet confident can carry it to scale.
