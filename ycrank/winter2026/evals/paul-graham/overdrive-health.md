# Overdrive Health -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Medical billing is broken and everyone knows it. That's the problem. Not that it isn't a real schlep -- it absolutely is. HIPAA compliance, payer-specific coding rules, denial management, fraud regulations, provider trust. This is exactly the kind of ugly, tedious complexity that causes schlep blindness. But here's the distinction people miss: schlep blindness produces hidden opportunities precisely because the difficulty drives people *away*. When a schlep has already attracted CodaMetrix ($95M+ raised), Cedar ($350M+, $3.2B valuation), Sift Healthcare ($41.5M), and a half-dozen others, the opportunity isn't hidden anymore. It's a known battlefield. The Stripe analogy would only hold if twenty well-funded companies had already been attacking payments when the Collisons started. They hadn't. That's what made Stripe work.

The question I always ask first: how did they find this problem? Both founders built AI agents at EliseAI -- which is described as a healthcare AI company but primarily sells to property management. Their technical pedigrees are impressive. Daniel Inge has Harvard CS degrees and Jane Street on his resume. Michael Schroeder comes from Duke, with stints at Citadel and Up&Up. These are clearly smart, capable engineers. But nothing in the dossier shows me the moment where one of them personally collided with medical billing and couldn't let go. No story about watching a family practice bleed revenue through coding errors. No experience working as a biller or running a claims operation. The path appears to be: worked at healthcare-adjacent AI company, surveyed the landscape for a big automatable market, landed on medical billing. That's the "startup idea machine" pattern -- the idea was selected, not discovered. I've seen this many times. Brilliant people who generate ideas that sound good from the outside but emerge from analysis rather than genuine need.

The bull case is real, though, and I want to be honest about it. Full-cycle medical billing is a schlep that *point solutions* can't solve. CodaMetrix does coding only. Cedar does patient payments only. Sift does analytics only. If Overdrive can actually deliver the full managed billing workflow -- insurance discovery through denial resolution -- using AI to undercut the cost structure of traditional billing companies, they'd own the provider relationship in a way none of those point solutions can. The "why now" has legs too: LLMs have genuinely crossed a threshold for medical document comprehension, and healthcare staffing shortages in billing departments are accelerating. A two-person team going broader than companies with 50x their capital is either frighteningly ambitious or dangerously naive. I can't tell which from the evidence available.

What gives me pause beyond the origin story is the total absence of user pull. No revenue signal. No customer names. No waitlist. No organic community. What I do see is Facebook Pixel and Google Ads tracking on the website -- which is marketing *push*, the opposite of organic *pull*. At pre-seed I don't expect much traction, but I expect at least one signal that a provider somewhere is using this and finding it indispensable. The best early-stage companies I've funded had at least one user who would be genuinely upset if the product disappeared. I don't see that here.

On the technical dimension, these founders check the boxes I care about. Harvard and Duke CS, Jane Street systems engineering, AI agent building at EliseAI. They can clearly write code. But no public GitHub repos, no open-source contributions, no visible prototype -- so I'm inferring technical ability from credentials rather than observing it from artifacts. That's fine at this stage but it's a weaker signal than seeing a working product that reflects genuine craft in its technical choices.

I'd want to fund the version of this company where one of the founders had spent two years running a medical billing department, personally calling insurance companies to fight denials, and building internal tools to automate the work because they couldn't stand how broken it was -- then realized the tools they'd built for themselves were the company. That's the Dropbox pattern: the founder's personal frustration *is* the product roadmap. What I see instead are two talented engineers who identified a large market and are applying their AI agent skills to it. That can work. It's just not the pattern that produces the companies I get most excited about.
