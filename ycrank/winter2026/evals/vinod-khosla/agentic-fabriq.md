# Agentic Fabriq -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything I need to know before I even evaluate the founders or the technology. Oasis Security has $75 million. Astrix has $85 million. CrowdStrike just paid $740 million for SGNL. Okta shipped Auth for GenAI — generally available — in October 2025, and announced a Cross App Access protocol specifically for agent-to-app delegation. Microsoft is building agent identity features. WorkOS launched agent auth in December. This is a two-person team with $500,000 walking into a room where every major security platform on the planet has already identified the same problem and started building the same solution. That is not the market structure where a pre-seed startup establishes a category. That is the market structure where a pre-seed startup gets outrun by incumbents who already own the buyer relationship.

Let me apply my fundamental test: if Agentic Fabriq succeeds completely — captures the agent permission layer for enterprises globally — what changes? Enterprises manage agent permissions better. Fewer security incidents from over-permissioned AI agents. IT admins have a cleaner dashboard. This is a real problem with real commercial value, but nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar industry becomes obsolete. No physical system transforms. The consequence of success is a useful enterprise security business — call it a few billion dollars at peak, more likely a $500M-$1B acquisition by Okta or CrowdStrike. That is a fine outcome for founders but it is not the kind of bet that justifies my attention. The dossier itself notes that the underlying components — OAuth delegation, policy engines, audit logging — are "well-understood building blocks that multiple teams could assemble." When your technology stack is a packaging of known primitives, the consequence of success is bounded by execution, not by invention.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. Agent adoption is moving on an exponential curve — from less than 5% of enterprise apps with embedded agents to a projected 40% in under two years. That is a real rate of change. If the permission problem turns out to be more architecturally complex than incumbents expect — if Okta's add-on approach genuinely cannot handle per-employee agent scoping because it requires a fundamentally different data model — then a purpose-built platform has a window. The CrowdStrike acquisition of SGNL at $740M on $42M raised shows the market pays category-defining prices in this space. And two 19-year-old MIT dropouts who move fast could theoretically out-iterate a $2.5B public company's product roadmap on a narrow use case. I have seen that movie before — Juniper against Cisco, where speed and purpose-built architecture beat the incumbent's bolt-on approach. But Juniper had technology that was architecturally impossible for Cisco to replicate without rebuilding from scratch. Here, the dossier explicitly states that Okta's XAA protocol already addresses agent-to-app delegation. The structural barrier is thin, and the moat is nonexistent.

What concerns me most is the pattern I recognize: this company has reduced the probability of failure by choosing a well-validated market, a clear buyer persona, and known technology — and in doing so, has reduced the consequence of success to something I would call inconsequential relative to what these founders could attempt. "Okta for Agents" is not a contrarian thesis. It is the most obvious analogy in enterprise AI, and when your one-liner is the consensus view of every security investor in Silicon Valley, you are not skating to where the puck will be — you are standing where everyone else already is. The founders are two MIT AI researchers building enterprise security middleware. They are neither outsiders bringing fresh eyes to identity management nor insiders with the enterprise security relationships needed to outmaneuver Okta's sales team. The team composition — two people from the same university, same discipline, same dropout cohort — is homogeneous in precisely the dimension that matters. An enterprise security company at pre-seed should have someone who has sold to a CISO, or at minimum someone who has operated inside the IAM stack they intend to replace. I see no evidence of that deliberate team construction.

I pass. These are smart, ambitious people working on a real problem — and that is exactly why I would tell them they are wasting their talent on something too small and too crowded. The agent identity problem will be solved. It will be solved by Okta extending its platform, by CrowdStrike integrating SGNL, by one of the $75M-funded startups already in market. It will not be solved by a new entrant with 1/200th the capital of its nearest competitor and no technological differentiation that the incumbents cannot replicate in a product cycle. Go find a problem where the incumbents are not already building your product.
