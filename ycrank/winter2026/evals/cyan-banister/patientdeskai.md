# Patientdesk.ai -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Patientdesk is what it isn't: unpopular. AI voice agents for dental practices might be the single most consensus category in early-stage investing right now. Arini came through YC one batch earlier building essentially the same product. Weave, a public company with 35,000 dental locations, just announced AI receptionist features. Sully.ai raised $35 million for healthcare AI employees. NexHealth raised $177 million. When I look at a deal and every sophisticated investor in town is already circling the same thesis, I know the weirdness has been priced out. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX when private space was laughable, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a fever dream -- shared one quality: other investors thought they were nuts. Nobody thinks an AI dental receptionist is nuts. They think it's obviously the future. That's precisely my problem with it.

When I ask myself the question I always start with -- tell me the founder's story, not the business -- I find professional competence but not the biographical thread I need. Öncel Özgül ran a call center for dental practices and co-founded a dental marketing agency. Fikri San Koktas has a physics degree from Pomona and is pursuing an ML master's at Aalto. Emre Kaplaner comes from a Nordic holding company. These are smart, capable people who spotted a real inefficiency in a vertical they know well. But there's no survival story here. There's no moment where the problem became personal in a way that would keep them building through the inevitable crisis -- the moment when Weave bundles this for free, or when Arini lands a distribution deal they can't match, or when the fundraise stalls because investors can't differentiate between them and three other companies doing the same thing. The agency-to-SaaS transition is a legitimate pattern, and I respect that Özgül literally sat in the chair answering dental phones before building the AI to do it. That's real domain knowledge. But domain knowledge and biographical grit are different things, and at the earliest stage, I'm betting on the person's relationship to the problem, not their résumé.

The bull case is real, and I want to be honest about it. These founders have done something that most pre-seed teams haven't: they're live in 60+ clinics across three countries, they've built integrations with 15+ practice management systems, and one of their customers reportedly generated $350K in bookings in a single month from the platform. The PMS integration layer is genuine engineering work -- dental software is fragmented and poorly documented, and each integration creates switching costs. The $1,000/month per location price point with 60+ clinics suggests meaningful early revenue. If they can dominate the integration layer before Weave or Arini do, they could build a defensible wedge. And Gustaf Alstromer as their YC partner suggests someone smart sees the potential. If I were an investor who evaluated primarily on execution velocity and market timing, this would look compelling.

But I'm not that investor. What I also notice -- and what I think a generic analyst would miss -- is what this company does to the people it's meant to serve. The pitch is about capturing revenue for dental practice owners. Missed calls become booked appointments, outstanding balances get collected, insurance gets verified automatically. That's valuable to the practice. But it doesn't create economic access for anyone who currently lacks it. The front-desk workers whose jobs this automates aren't getting a new income stream -- they're getting replaced. Compare that to how Uber created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers, or how Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out of the system, or how Thumbtack connected skilled tradespeople with customers. I invest in companies where the rising tide lifts boats that were previously stuck on the bottom. This lifts boats that were already floating. You could argue that 24/7 call answering improves patient access to dental care, and there's something to that, but the product's own framing is about revenue optimization and lead generation, not about getting underserved patients into the chair.

The geographic spread also concerns me. Three people across the US, Australia, and the UK, each with different insurance systems, different PMS ecosystems, different regulatory frameworks. That reads like an agency habit -- chasing revenue across markets you already have relationships in -- rather than the deep, focused market penetration that builds a defensible company. At this stage, with this team size, I'd want to see obsessive focus on owning one market completely before expanding.

This is a well-executed company in a space I'd never invest in. The founders are competent operators who identified a real problem, but the category is consensus, the competition is fierce and well-funded, and neither the founder story nor the company's impact profile activates the conviction I need to write a check from my own money.
