# Cajal -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's a company trying to build AI-powered formal mathematical verification in a category where Harmonic AI has raised $295 million at a $1.45 billion valuation and Axiom Math has raised $164 million at $300 million -- and neither of those companies reports any revenue. Let that sink in. Hundreds of millions deployed into pure narrative, zero reported commercial traction across the entire category. When I see a pre-seed team of two entering this kind of capital-saturated zero-revenue landscape, the question isn't "can they compete?" It's "what does the capital structure of this market tell you about the underlying economics?" And what it tells me is that formal verification + AI is currently a research prestige race being funded like infrastructure, without anyone having demonstrated that customers will actually pay for it. That's the opposite of my downside-cushion thesis.

My sane-person-insane-idea filter produces a troubling readout here. Start with the "insane" side: is using AI to autonomously discover formally verified mathematical proofs a non-consensus bet? It was -- three years ago. Today, DeepMind built AlphaProof, Harmonic got gold on the 2025 IMO, and every serious AI lab has a formal reasoning team. The market has spoken: this is consensus. The applied-domain angle -- quantum computing, finance -- adds a wrinkle of differentiation, but the core thesis that AI can do formal verification is now mainstream enough to attract a billion-plus in aggregate funding. Now the "sane" side: neither founder has publicly documented experience in formal verification, theorem proving, or the Lean ecosystem. Luke Johnston's background is ML and neuroscience research across Oxford, Cambridge, and UCL -- genuinely strong academic pedigree, but in adjacent rather than directly relevant domains. Pedro Nobre built computer vision systems and co-founded a startup called Vertebra. These are capable people. But I'm looking for the Brian Armstrong signal -- someone whose specific background makes them the obvious person to build THIS company. That signal isn't here. And the co-founders met at Entrepreneurs First, which is exactly the accelerator co-founder matching pattern I flag as a risk. Deep pre-existing relationships survive adversity; speed-dating partnerships often don't.

Now the AI kill test -- and this is where Cajal runs directly into my framework's buzz saw. AI isn't the cherry on top of this business. AI IS the business. Remove the AI component and Cajal has nothing -- no physical operations, no regulatory position, no proprietary data (yet), no protocol with installed base. The Lean ecosystem is open-source. DeepSeek has released open-source Lean4 prover models. LeanDojo at Caltech provides free toolkits and benchmarks. The entire infrastructure layer beneath Cajal is being commoditized in real time. When I invested in Craftwork, the moat was painting crews and scheduling -- things software can optimize but not replace. When I backed Metropolis, the moat was installed parking hardware. Here, the moat is supposedly a multi-agent orchestration system built on open-source foundations, targeting domain-specific formalization libraries that don't yet exist, built by founders without documented expertise in the domain. That's three layers of "not yet" stacked on top of each other.

Let me engage honestly with the bull case, because there IS a structurally interesting angle buried here. If Cajal's verified training datasets and benchmark evaluations became the standard infrastructure for anyone training formal reasoning models -- the way ImageNet became standard for computer vision -- that would be a genuine primitive play. "Verified training corpora for Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle" could theoretically be the data layer that every AI lab and every competitor needs to build on. And the narrative magnitude is real: "scaling formal verification to accelerate scientific discovery" is an authentic infinity story. If formal verification becomes the standard for validating results in quantum computing, drug discovery, financial modeling, aerospace -- you're talking about a new layer of trust infrastructure for science itself. That's legitimately unbounded. The problem is that everything between here and there requires domain expertise the team hasn't demonstrated, proprietary data they haven't accumulated, and customer relationships they haven't built, all while competitors with 100x their capital are operating in adjacent territory.

The structural position reminds me uncomfortably of my Birchbox lesson -- though the failure mode would be different. Birchbox had narrative magnitude without structural moat; Cajal has narrative magnitude without the founder-domain fit or the resource base to execute before better-capitalized players move into their lane. Harmonic or Axiom pivoting into applied scientific domains would be trivial compared to Cajal trying to catch up to their scale. And the open-source dynamics here are uniquely dangerous: the $10 million in new Lean ecosystem funding, LeanDojo's free benchmarks, DeepSeek's open-source provers -- the floor is rising under everyone's feet, which means differentiation has to come from somewhere other than the technology itself. Without documented domain expertise in formal methods, without proprietary data, without customers or even demand signals, I don't see where that differentiation materializes. Pass.
