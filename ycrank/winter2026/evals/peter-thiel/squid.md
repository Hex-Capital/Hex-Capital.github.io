# Squid -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of Squid is that a two-person pre-seed company has already deployed a live product at National Grid DSO -- one of the largest distribution system operators in the UK. A Head of Flexibility Markets publicly endorsed the tool. At first glance, this signals extraordinary founder-market fit and execution velocity. But before I evaluate execution, I need to ask the prior question: what is the secret? What important truth do these founders believe about the world that most intelligent observers actively reject?

The answer, as far as I can determine, is that there is no secret. The thesis -- "grid planning tools are fragmented legacy desktop software, and utilities need modern browser-native collaboration" -- is the most consensus position imaginable in enterprise infrastructure software in 2026. Every enterprise investor has spent the last decade funding the vertical SaaS replacement of legacy desktop tools: Figma replaced Adobe's desktop tools, Procore replaced construction management spreadsheets, and a dozen companies are trying to replace every other desktop-bound workflow with browser-native collaboration. "Modernize legacy enterprise software" is not a secret -- it is the default venture thesis of the last ten years applied to yet another vertical. The energy transition angle does not rescue this from consensus. That AI-driven demand from data centers is straining the grid, that EVs and distributed generation require new planning approaches -- these are front-page observations, not hidden truths. The U.S. DOE is publicly funding AI challenges for grid planning. When the government is explicitly soliciting solutions to a problem, the problem is not a secret.

The competitive landscape confirms the absence of a secret. Neara just raised $90 million at a $1.1 billion valuation. Camus Energy has raised $29 million. Envelio serves 80+ utilities before being absorbed by E.ON. GridCog participates in Google's accelerator. Capital is flooding into grid software from every direction. This is precisely the Girardian dynamic I warn about: multiple companies converging on the same broad thesis, imitating each other into adjacent niches, each claiming differentiation through slightly different positioning -- "we do planning, they do asset management, they do orchestration." But the boundaries between planning, orchestration, simulation, and asset management are porous. Neara, with $166 million in funding and a unicorn valuation, could expand into collaborative planning workflows with a single product initiative. The "we focus on planning specifically" argument is a market-positioning story, not a structural moat. When a well-funded competitor can replicate your wedge faster than you can expand beyond it, you are in a competitive market, and competitive markets destroy profits for everyone.

The strongest bull case deserves serious engagement. If Squid becomes the canonical system of record for grid network models -- the single source of truth where institutional knowledge accumulates, version history compounds, and every stakeholder operates from the same model -- the switching costs would grow monotonically over time. This is the Palantir pattern: once an intelligence agency builds its analytical workflows on your data platform, the cost of extraction exceeds the cost of renewal indefinitely. A grid operator whose entire planning history, scenario library, and model versions live in Squid would face enormous friction in migrating to a competitor. The founders' domain credentials support this path -- Kolokotronis is a second-time cleantech founder with Cambridge engineering, AWS AI/ML experience, and a prior company (VoltQuant) that served the exact same customer base. Jones has been inside both National Grid and Octopus Energy. They know the buyers, they know the workflows, and the National Grid DSO deployment proves they can execute. If grid operators are moving from a fragmented world of spreadsheets and PDFs to a unified planning platform, and Squid captures that transition at enough large DSOs, the lock-in becomes genuine.

But the bull case requires Squid to win a race against better-funded competitors in a market that is attracting massive capital -- which is the definition of competition, not monopoly. The technology, as described, is not 10x better in any dimension I can identify. Browser-native collaboration is meaningfully better than desktop tools, but it is not an order-of-magnitude improvement that makes the old approach structurally uneconomic. Competitors can build browser-native interfaces. The "AI-powered" claim is unsubstantiated -- I see no evidence of a proprietary AI capability that creates a technological discontinuity. The design-partner approach and "Coming Soon" pricing suggest the founders are iterating toward product-market fit rather than executing a definite plan -- this is lean methodology, not definite optimism. And the Envelio acquisition by E.ON suggests that the natural endgame for companies in this space may be absorption by an incumbent utility, not independent market dominance. A company whose most likely exit is acquisition by a utility conglomerate is not a power-law investment.

The founders are competent operators with genuine domain expertise entering a real and growing market. In many investment frameworks, this would be sufficient. In mine, it is not. A competent team pursuing a consensus thesis in a competitive market is precisely the profile that produces modest outcomes -- a $200 million SaaS business, perhaps an acquisition by Siemens or Schneider Electric -- but not the 100x or 1000x return that justifies a power-law portfolio. The grid needs better planning tools. Everyone knows this. And when everyone knows it, the returns accrue to capital, not to insight.
