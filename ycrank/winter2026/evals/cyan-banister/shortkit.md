# shortkit -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with ShortKit: this is the opposite of an unpopular idea. "Short-form video is the dominant content format, every app needs it, here's the infrastructure to make it easy" -- every partner at every fund on Sand Hill Road would nod along to that pitch without a single uncomfortable pause. And that's precisely the problem for me. The most promising companies I've backed were the ones that made people squirm. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, people thought I'd lost my mind. When we backed Crusoe Energy, mining Bitcoin on stranded gas in North Dakota, investors literally laughed. ShortKit is a well-reasoned product thesis built on obvious market trends, and I don't feel that jolt -- that disorienting sense that I'm seeing something the crowd is missing. I feel the crowd standing right beside me, and that means the price of being right here isn't going to be extraordinary.

The strongest signal in this dossier is Michael Seleman's six years building the infrastructure behind YouTube Shorts. That's not nothing -- that's deep, specific, hard-won knowledge about how short-form video actually works at the largest scale on the planet. I respect that. But when I ask my first question -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I hear is a Google engineer who left a prestigious role to productize what he already knew how to build. That's a career move, not a calling. I don't hear the biographical thread that connects this person to this problem in a way that transcends professional expertise. Where's the adversity that forged the conviction? Where's the personal stake that means this founder won't quit when the first major customer churns or when Mux decides to build a competing SDK in a quarter? Compare that to the Contraline founder, who'd spent years in academic research on male contraception that nobody cared about, or Travis Kalanick, whose entire personality was a weapon against the taxi medallion cartel. I'm not hearing that kind of biographical necessity here.

Neil Bhammar brings operational hustle -- scaling BusRight from early stage through Series B, enterprise sales to school districts, the Dorm Room Fund network. He graduated from Northeastern in 2022, which makes him young but not inexperienced. What I can't figure out from the dossier is how these two found each other. No shared university, no shared employer, no visible connection. Michael was at Google building YouTube infrastructure; Neil was at a school bus routing startup in Boston. That gap isn't a red flag by itself, but after HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect timing and perfect product can't survive founder conflict, I probe co-founder relationships harder than anything else. How do these two argue? Who has the final call on technical architecture versus go-to-market? A team of two with no visible pre-existing relationship and no shared adversity is something I'd need to understand deeply before writing a check.

The bull case is real and I want to honor it: if short-form video truly becomes a mandatory feature in every consumer app -- the way chat, payments, and maps already are -- then ShortKit could be the Twilio of vertical video. Michael's YouTube Shorts expertise is a genuine competitive advantage that would take any challenger years to replicate at that depth. The vertical integration play (SDK plus analytics plus feed ranking plus monetization) creates switching costs that horizontal video APIs like Mux or Cloudflare Stream can't easily match without cannibalizing their general-purpose positioning. If the embeddable short-form feed market is real and large, this team has a credible shot at owning it. But that "if" is doing enormous work. The dossier itself notes the demand is unproven, the market size for this specific vertical is unknown, and they're iOS-only at launch -- which means any Android-first competitor gets an open lane.

What I keep returning to is that ShortKit doesn't create economic access for anyone who currently lacks it. It doesn't make an invisible system visible. It doesn't operate in a stigmatized or regulated space that deters other investors. It's a well-executed B2B developer tool that makes engineering teams more productive. That's a perfectly valid business, and someone should fund it -- but it doesn't activate the dimensions I care about most. I invest because I believe capitalism can be a vehicle for expanding opportunity to people who've been locked out. Uber gave drivers a livelihood. Affirm gave borrowers transparent credit. Flock Safety gave communities visibility into public safety data. ShortKit gives product teams a faster way to ship video feeds. That's useful, not transformative. This is a pass for me -- not because the founders aren't capable, but because nothing about this company requires the kind of conviction-over-consensus thinking that defines how I invest my own money.
