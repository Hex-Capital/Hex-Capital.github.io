# Lance -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is what I see when I look at Lance: a well-executed vertical SaaS company solving a real operational problem — hotels missing 40% of their calls — with capable founders and legitimate early traction. And I stop right there. If Lance succeeds completely, if every Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt property on the planet runs their front desk through Lance's AI agents, what changes? Hotels save on labor costs. More calls get answered. A few more restaurant reservations get captured. The hospitality industry becomes incrementally more efficient. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No incumbent system becomes structurally obsolete. The consequence of success is a solid business in a growing vertical — and that is precisely the outcome I avoid investing in.

The 50+ hotel deployments across major brands at pre-seed is genuinely impressive distribution velocity. Most YC companies at this stage have a handful of design partners and some letters of intent. Lance has real production deployments and a named operations platform partnership with Quore. The testimonial claiming 30% reduction in front desk call volume is a concrete signal of product-market fit. I want to be clear: this is a well-run company with early evidence that the product works. My concern is not execution quality — it is ambition calibration.

The Computer Use Agent approach — having AI navigate existing hotel software UIs rather than requiring custom API integrations — is technically clever. It solves a genuine pain point in hospitality, where PMS systems from Oracle OPERA and Cloudbeds are notoriously difficult to integrate with. But here is the problem: Anthropic released computer use capabilities publicly in late 2024. This is an application layer built on a foundation that is being actively commoditized by the very companies providing the underlying technology. Canary Technologies, sitting on $180M in funding and a $600M valuation, already has hotel relationships across thousands of properties and launched an AI Voice module in 2025. When your core technical differentiator is an application of a capability that Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are racing to improve and democratize, the moat is workflow knowledge and customer switching costs — not technology. That is a defensible business, but it is not a disruptive one.

Let me engage seriously with the bull case, because there is one. Square started as a dongle that let small merchants accept credit cards — which looked like a narrow vertical tool. But Square actually unlocked an entirely new category of merchant that previously couldn't participate in electronic payments, which cascaded into lending, payroll, banking, and a $40 billion company. Could Lance follow a similar arc? Could autonomous hotel agents become autonomous agents for restaurants, then event venues, then the entire service industry — each requiring the same computer-use-agent capability applied to different legacy software? If Lance's per-property workflow learning creates a compounding data advantage, and if the team uses hospitality as a wedge into a much broader "AI operations agent for every physical business" vision, the consequence magnitude expands dramatically. But the dossier shows no evidence of this ambition. The positioning is "Your Hotel's Best Employees" — not "autonomous operations for every service business." The team appears to be building exactly what they describe: an excellent hotel operations product. And an excellent hotel operations product is, for my portfolio, insufficiently ambitious.

The team itself is competent and well-assembled for this specific problem. Caleb Chan built voice and AI agent technology at Google and Salesforce and was a founding engineer at a company with a nine-figure exit — that is operational maturity you rarely see at pre-seed. Gatik Trivedi brings speech and language research from Stanford and a prior startup exit. But this is not a team of outsiders attacking something the industry considers impossible. This is a team of AI/product professionals applying state-of-the-art tools to a well-understood gap in a well-understood industry. They are not skating ahead of the puck — they are skating directly to where everyone else already sees it heading, in a market with $280M in competing venture capital already deployed across Canary and Duve alone.

The timing on AI voice and computer use agents is favorable — these capabilities reached production quality in 2024-2025, and the hospitality staffing crisis provides sustained demand. But favorable timing in a market that is already crowded with well-funded competitors is different from favorable timing in a market nobody else has entered yet. When I backed OpenAI in 2019, AI was "laughable" and we were four years ahead of the venture consensus. Lance is entering a market where Canary just raised $80M six months ago specifically to build AI capabilities for hotels. That is consensus timing, not contrarian timing.
