# MouseCat -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is the thing that tells me everything I need to know about MouseCat: Sardine raised $70 million in February 2025 and explicitly announced "a suite of intelligent agents designed to streamline fraud and compliance operations." That is not an incumbent dismissing the approach — that is an incumbent with $145 million in total capital, 130% year-over-year ARR growth, and 100+ customers actively building the exact same product. When I backed Juniper Networks, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. When I backed Impossible Foods, the meat industry laughed. The signal I look for is experts and incumbents telling you it cannot be done. When the incumbents are sprinting toward the same destination with ten times the capital and a hundred times the customer base, that is the opposite signal. MouseCat is not attacking a problem the establishment considers crazy — it is attacking a problem the establishment considers its next product roadmap item.

Let me start where I always start: if MouseCat fully succeeds, what changes? Fraud investigators at banks and fintechs become dramatically more productive. Rules get written and deployed faster. Models get trained with synthetic labels before ground truth arrives. That is genuinely valuable — I do not dispute the utility. But the consequence of full success is that financial institutions have a better tool in their fraud operations stack. The industry does not restructure. The fundamental approach — human investigators supported by vendor data, governed by compliance teams — remains intact. MouseCat accelerates the existing workflow rather than replacing it. This is the pattern I have passed on hundreds of times: a strong team building a product that makes an enterprise process 30% or even 300% more efficient, in a crowded market where success means a decent business, not an industry transformation. The consequence of success is not inconsequential, but it is bounded in a way that does not justify the risk profile I seek.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement because there is one element of technical ambition that caught my attention: synthetic label generation. If MouseCat can accurately identify fraud before ground-truth labels exist — generating training signal that incumbents' supervised learning pipelines cannot access — that could be a fundamentally different capability, not an incremental one. A system that discovers fraud patterns the industry does not yet know about is categorically different from one that automates known investigation workflows. If the synthetic labeling creates a data advantage that compounds over time, MouseCat could evolve from an investigation tool into the intelligence layer that defines what fraud looks like, ahead of the scoring platforms. That would be a genuine disruption of the incumbent approach. But the dossier notes that synthetic label generation is "a research area with published methods," the on-premises deployment model limits cross-customer data effects, and I see no evidence this capability has been validated in production. The transformative version of this company remains hypothetical.

The founders are competent and well-matched — McAllister spent four years building ATO and ACH fraud models at Coinbase, Aldridge built the literal agent infrastructure at AWS that this product category runs on. The team composition directly addresses the two obvious risks: fraud domain expertise and AI agent architecture. McAllister has a prior exit, modest though it was. This is a well-engineered founding team. But they are insiders, not outsiders. They are applying their former employers' expertise to an adjacent problem. Nobody is going to tell these founders they are crazy for building AI fraud investigation tools — every fraud vendor on the planet is already pursuing this direction. The courage required here is the courage to sell enterprise software against well-funded competitors, not the courage to attempt what the consensus considers impossible. I look for the latter.

The timing trajectory is real but already consensus. LLMs became capable of agentic investigation workflows in 2024-2025, and every major fraud platform noticed simultaneously. Sardine, Sift, DataVisor — they all have ML teams that can orchestrate these same workflows. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, nobody in venture was writing AI checks. The timing advantage was four years of compound learning before the market arrived. MouseCat does not have that kind of temporal advantage — the market arrived before they did, and Sardine is spending $70 million to make sure it stays ahead.

I respect this team and I believe they will build a real product that real customers pay for. That is exactly why this is not my kind of bet. They have correctly identified a genuine gap in the fraud operations stack, assembled the right team to address it, and positioned themselves in a growing market. They have also reduced their probability of failure to the point where the consequences of success are, in my view, manageable rather than transformational. A strong outcome here is a $500 million company. I need to see a path to replacing how an industry fundamentally operates, and I do not see that path here.
