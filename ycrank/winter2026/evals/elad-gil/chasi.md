# Chasi -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice here is something most evaluators would skip: I already placed a bet in this market. Moab, which I backed alongside Ironspring Ventures at $16M, is building the full-stack operating system for equipment dealers. Chasi is building an AI sales overlay for the same customer base. Setting aside the portfolio conflict for a moment and evaluating Chasi on its own merits, this competitive dynamic actually reveals the core strategic question. Equipment dealer software is a genuine "too boring" market -- the kind I love -- but the question is whether the AI communication layer is the right wedge. When I backed Gusto, payroll was the wedge that became the distribution channel for HR, benefits, and compliance. When Stripe started with payments, the developer API became the channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. An AI sales agent that sits on top of someone else's ERP is not a wedge into anything. It's a feature.

The structural moment is real but generic. LLM capabilities crossed the threshold for domain-specific conversational AI sometime in 2023-2024, and equipment dealers -- with sub-60% fleet utilization, phone-based workflows, and missed quotes -- are exactly the kind of underdigitized vertical where AI agents create immediate value. I buy that thesis entirely. I bought it when I invested in Moab. But "LLMs got good enough to automate phone-heavy sales processes" is the same structural moment driving AI sales agents in auto dealerships, HVAC distribution, building materials, and a dozen other fragmented industrial verticals. The timing is correct but not distinctive. There's no capability threshold specific to equipment dealers that other investors haven't mapped.

The founders' Axion Ray background is the strongest signal in this dossier. Both Akash and Sarman were on the founding team of an AI-for-manufacturing company that reached a $62M Series B selling to Boeing, Cummins, Harley Davidson, and Denso. They know how to sell AI to industrial companies that operate on relationship-driven, trade-show-heavy sales cycles -- and their AED Summit presence and Ambassador partnership confirms they're executing that playbook, not just theorizing about it. The fact that they're already live with equipment businesses in the US and Europe at pre-seed stage, with customer testimonials reporting 3x faster response rates and 15% quote-to-win improvement, suggests real execution velocity. This is not a theoretical product.

The bull case is that Chasi captures the revenue intelligence layer for equipment dealers before anyone else, accumulates proprietary data on equipment demand patterns and pricing dynamics, and becomes indispensable to the sales process in a way that's complementary to -- not competitive with -- ERP systems. In this scenario, even Moab would want to integrate with Chasi rather than rebuild its AI communication capabilities from scratch. The data flywheel would create a moat: every dealer interaction teaches the AI about equipment-specific sales patterns that horizontal AI agent platforms would take years to replicate. The founders' industrial AI sales experience means they can land enterprise deals in a market where trust is earned through trade shows and handshakes, not Product Hunt launches. If this plays out, it could become the revenue operations infrastructure for every equipment dealer, the same way PagerDuty became operations infrastructure for every company running software.

But I don't think that's the most likely path. The core technology -- LLM-powered conversational agents for sales -- is becoming commoditized rapidly. Vertical specialization in equipment workflows provides differentiation today, but the barrier is domain knowledge and integrations, not fundamental technology. Moab, with 8x the funding and a full-stack platform, can add AI sales agents as a feature. Legacy DMS providers like Texada can partner with any horizontal AI sales platform. The overlay position means Chasi doesn't own the system of record -- and companies that don't own the system of record have structurally limited switching costs. When I evaluate the product-to-distribution trajectory, I see a single-product company with no articulated path to becoming a platform. The founders haven't publicly described how AI sales agents become a distribution channel for additional products. That's the difference between a good feature and a generational company.

The single-miracle test is also muddled. The AI quality miracle -- making conversational agents reliable enough for nuanced equipment sales -- is being delivered by foundation model labs, not by Chasi. That's actually favorable, as I noted with Harvey: when someone else is solving your hardest technical problem, you can focus on workflow and distribution. But Harvey's miracle was clearly articulated, and the team organized everything around building workflow infrastructure ahead of the capability curve. Chasi's unique miracle would be winning distribution in a fragmented, relationship-driven market before better-funded competitors capture the same customer base -- and I don't see evidence that the team has identified this as their critical obstacle and organized around it. They're doing the right things (trade shows, industry partnerships), but the strategic framing isn't crisp enough. With Moab entering simultaneously and multiple DMS incumbents potentially partnering with horizontal AI platforms, the window for establishing a distribution moat is narrow.
