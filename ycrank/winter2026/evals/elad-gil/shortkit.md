# shortkit -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most interesting thing about ShortKit is a founder who spent six years building the infrastructure behind YouTube Shorts -- one of the three platforms that defined the short-form video format globally. That's not advisory experience or product management adjacency. That's systems-level knowledge of adaptive bitrate transcoding, feed ranking, and delivery optimization at a scale only YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram have achieved. When I see someone who built the actual machine at a platform and then productizes that knowledge, I pay attention. It's the kind of domain depth that takes years to accumulate and can't be hired for. The question isn't whether Michael Seleman understands the technical problem. The question is whether the market he's building for actually exists at meaningful scale.

And that's where I get stuck. My first filter on any company is the structural moment: what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this market possible now? For ShortKit, the honest answer is... not much. Short-form vertical video became the dominant consumer content format in 2020-2021. TikTok, Reels, and Shorts all reached mainstream adoption three to four years ago. The thesis that non-social-media apps now want to embed TikTok-style feeds is plausible, but it's a gradual diffusion of a mature format, not a capability threshold being crossed. Compare this to when I looked at Harvey -- GPT-3 to GPT-4 was a specific, measurable capability jump that unlocked legal AI practically overnight. Where's the equivalent inflection for embeddable short-form video? CDN costs declining, 5G adoption, iOS video framework improvements -- these are all real but incremental. There's no moment where you say "this was impossible last year and possible today."

The market sizing question is the real concern. The dossier cites a $7.73 billion video processing platform market, but ShortKit's actual addressable segment -- consumer apps that want purpose-built short-form video feed infrastructure rather than simple video hosting -- is unquantified and unproven. How many apps genuinely need TikTok-style feed ranking, engagement analytics, and adaptive transcoding as a managed SDK? News publishers, fitness apps, e-commerce apps -- the list sounds plausible at pitch-deck level. But when I apply the bottom-up test ("would an enterprise actually pay for this?"), I'm uncertain whether these apps need a specialized short-form feed SDK or whether they'd get 80% of the value from Mux plus some custom feed logic. This might be a market that's genuinely too niche rather than one that appears niche but is secretly enormous. PagerDuty looked boring, but operations alerting serves every company running software -- that's a universal need. "Embeddable short-form video feeds" doesn't have that same structural universality.

The bull case I want to seriously engage with: if the "TikTok-ification" of every consumer app continues accelerating -- if dating apps, recipe apps, learning apps, news apps, and retail apps all decide they need vertical video feeds as a core engagement mechanism -- then ShortKit is building the picks-and-shovels infrastructure for that shift, and the market is ten times larger than it appears. Seleman would be the ideal founder for that world. The product-to-distribution path also exists: start with the feed SDK, then expand into engagement analytics, ad monetization, content management, and personalization -- becoming the full engagement infrastructure layer for video-first apps. SDK integration creates real switching costs, and vertical specialization for short-form feeds is something the horizontal players like Mux and Cloudflare Stream would resist building because it conflicts with their general-purpose positioning. If that structural dynamic plays out, this is a Stripe-like wedge -- purpose-built tooling that serves developers better than the incumbents in a specific use case, then expands from there.

But I keep returning to two structural concerns. First, the components underneath ShortKit -- HLS transcoding, CDN delivery, video player SDKs, basic analytics -- are individually commoditized. The value proposition is the vertical integration, the fact that it's all stitched together for the short-form feed pattern. That's real value, but it's integration value, not technology-moat value. Mux with $46 million in revenue and 4,900 customers could build a short-form feed add-on if the market proved out. Second, iOS-only at launch immediately halves the addressable market. Every enterprise prospect with an Android audience will defer, and a competitor who ships Android first captures that half. These aren't fatal individually, but they compound with the market uncertainty.

Neil Bhammar's operating experience at BusRight through Series B -- 700% revenue growth, 23 states, institutional sales -- adds real go-to-market capability. But BusRight is school bus routing software, not video infrastructure. The pairing has no shared professional or educational history, which isn't a red flag on its own but means the co-founder relationship hasn't been stress-tested in a shared context. The product exists on shortkit.dev with a detailed feature set, which shows execution. But no public traction signals -- no customers, no LOIs, no community -- means I can't assess whether any of those features are being used by anyone. At pre-seed, that's not disqualifying, but it means the market validation miracle is entirely ahead of them.

The single miracle here is proving that enough consumer apps want specialized short-form video feed infrastructure to support a standalone company. That miracle is identifiable, and the team's technical depth positions them to deliver a compelling product. But unlike Harvey, where the miracle (model fidelity) was being delivered by external labs on a visible timeline, ShortKit's miracle (market demand) has no external forcing function driving it to resolution. It's a bet on gradual adoption of a mature format, not a bet on a capability curve you can track. I'd want to see two or three design partners who've committed to integrating the SDK before I'd have conviction that the market isn't just theoretically interesting.
