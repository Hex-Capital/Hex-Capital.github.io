# shortkit -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company built by the ultimate insider. Michael Seleman spent six years constructing the infrastructure that powers YouTube Shorts -- one of the three dominant short-form video systems on earth -- and is now productizing that knowledge as a managed SDK for consumer app teams. This is exactly the pattern I warn founders about. When you've spent six years inside the machine, you know every gear, every tolerance, every failure mode. You also know what's "not possible." You build something well-scoped, achievable, and incremental. Seleman isn't attacking YouTube or TikTok -- he's making it slightly easier for other apps to replicate a version of what they already built. That's not irreverence and naivety. That's an experienced engineer packaging his expertise into a product. I have enormous respect for the skill involved, but skill applied to a small problem still produces a small outcome.

Let me start where I always start: if ShortKit succeeds completely, what happens? Every fitness app, news publisher, and e-commerce platform has a polished TikTok-like feed embedded in their iOS app. And then what? The world doesn't operate differently. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. No incumbent's business model collapses. You have a solid developer infrastructure company -- maybe a hundred million in revenue at full maturity, serving a few hundred product teams. That's a fine business. It is not the kind of consequence that justifies two founders spending the most productive years of their careers on it. The dossier's own framing -- "We make enterprise-scale short-form video really simple" -- tells me everything. They are making something simpler. Not replacing something. Not inventing something. Simplifying an existing pattern. I've seen this movie hundreds of times in B2B developer tools, and the ending is always the same: a competent company in a crowded market that nobody outside the industry has heard of.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Someone could argue ShortKit is "Stripe for short-form video" -- that just as Stripe became the default infrastructure for internet payments and enabled an entire generation of businesses, ShortKit could become the default infrastructure for video feeds and unlock a wave of video-native consumer experiences. There's a version of this story where short-form video becomes as fundamental to consumer apps as payments, and ShortKit captures that infrastructure layer. Seleman's insider knowledge isn't a liability in this telling -- it's the equivalent of the Collison brothers understanding payments deeply enough to abstract the complexity. If the market for embeddable video feeds turns out to be enormous and every consumer app genuinely needs this capability, the vertical integration play has real value. But I don't buy it. Stripe enabled something that was genuinely broken -- accepting payments online was a nightmare. Building a short-form video feed is hard but not broken. Teams at serious consumer apps already have video engineers. And the components -- transcoding, CDN delivery, player SDKs -- are commoditized. The dossier says so explicitly. ShortKit's value is packaging, not invention. Packaging businesses face a fundamental problem: Mux, with $177 million raised and $46 million in revenue, can build this vertical add-on any quarter it chooses.

The technology disruption dimension is where this falls apart most clearly. Every individual component ShortKit bundles -- HLS transcoding, CDN delivery, engagement analytics, feed ranking -- exists as a commodity service. The differentiation is integration and optimization for a specific use case, which is real engineering work but not a technology breakthrough. Compare this to Juniper Networks, where Pradeep Sindhu brought genuinely novel router architecture that made Cisco's approach structurally obsolete. Or to Square, where the mobile payment dongle created a capability that literally didn't exist before. ShortKit creates no new capability. It packages existing capabilities more conveniently for one vertical. That's an integration play, not a disruption play. When experts and incumbents can validate your approach without feeling threatened, you haven't built something disruptive -- you've built something convenient.

On timing: short-form video reached mainstream adoption years ago. TikTok, Reels, and Shorts are mature products with billions of users. The "why now" for embeddable short-form feeds in non-social apps is entirely inferred in the dossier -- there's no evidence that demand from non-social apps is actually accelerating. ShortKit isn't skating to where the puck will be. The puck arrived, the game is well underway, and ShortKit is selling better skates to the players who showed up late. The iOS-only limitation at launch further narrows an already uncertain addressable market, and the enterprise sales motion (Calendly-based technical walkthroughs) suggests they're not even building for the kind of velocity that would let them establish a position before Mux or a well-funded competitor decides this vertical is worth pursuing.

I'll say what I always say to founders like this: you're too talented for the size of this problem. Seleman has knowledge that maybe a few hundred people on earth possess -- deep understanding of how short-form video systems work at planetary scale. That knowledge could be applied to something that actually changes how the world works. Instead, it's being used to help product teams at consumer apps avoid hiring two video engineers. The consequence of success here is inconsequential relative to the talent being deployed.
