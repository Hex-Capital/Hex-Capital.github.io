# VOYGR -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what immediately strikes me about VOYGR: the CEO, Vlad Baskakov, was the Product Strategy Principal at Google Maps. He led API product strategy and GTM for the exact product he's now building against. That's not just founder-market fit -- that's someone who sat inside the machine and saw precisely where the gears don't mesh. He watched Google optimize Maps for its own advertising ecosystem while third-party developers got leftover attention. And he left to build the thing Google can't build because of its own incentive structure. I understand that instinct. It's the kind of insider knowledge that's genuinely valuable. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I hear is a career narrative, not a survival story. Harvard MBA, McKinsey, a series of impressive GM roles at Lyft, OYO, Gett, and then Google. Yarik Markov brings twenty years of ML engineering at Apple, Google, and Meta. These are extremely polished resumes. And polished resumes don't tell me whether someone will still be standing when the company hits its crisis moment -- and every company has one.

The thing that gives me pause beyond the founder question is that this doesn't feel weird to me at all. "Real-world place intelligence for AI apps and agents" is possibly the most consensus framing you could put on a company right now. Every investor in the Valley is looking for infrastructure plays that serve AI agents. This is the hot category. When I back something, I want to feel that discomfort of explaining it to other investors and watching them recoil -- the way people looked at me when I described Crusoe mining Bitcoin on gas flares, or when I told them about Contraline's male contraceptive gel. VOYGR doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. It makes them nod. And when everyone's nodding, the price is usually wrong and the opportunity has already been arbitraged.

The competitive landscape here genuinely worries me. Foursquare has $448 million in funding and a hundred million POIs. Placer.ai is at $100 million ARR with a $1.5 billion valuation. Radar.io has raised $85 million and is already positioned as the developer-friendly Google Maps alternative. And then there's Google itself, which is actively building Maps-Gemini data sharing -- literally the AI-enriched location data layer that VOYGR is trying to create independently. Vlad would have had direct visibility into that initiative from his time at Google. He either knows something about why it won't work, or he's building directly into the path of a freight train. I don't see the structural moat that would protect this company if any of those incumbents decide to serve the AI agent use case more intentionally. The web-enrichment layer is technically replicable by anyone with crawling infrastructure.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because it's real. If you believe -- as Vlad clearly does -- that Google's ad-driven incentive structure creates a permanent misalignment between what Google Maps optimizes for and what AI agent developers need, then there's a genuine structural gap. Google's March 2025 pricing changes, removing the $200 monthly credit and deprecating the legacy Places API, are creating real friction. Developers are looking for alternatives right now. And VOYGR's framing -- validated, continuously enriched place data specifically designed for AI consumption -- is the right product at the right moment. If Vlad can move fast enough to capture the developer community that's being pushed away from Google, and if the data quality feedback loop from "several customers already running at scale" compounds into a genuine accuracy advantage, this could become the default place data layer for AI applications. That's a big outcome. I just don't see the biographical conviction or the non-consensus weirdness that makes me trust a founding team to survive the war of attrition required to get there against opponents with hundreds of millions in capital.

I also don't see the economic access dimension that draws me to my best investments. Uber created income for drivers. Affirm made credit transparent for borrowers. Thumbtack connected tradespeople to customers. VOYGR makes AI apps give slightly better restaurant recommendations. It's a B2B developer tool that optimizes an existing workflow. There's nothing wrong with that -- it's just not the kind of company that gets me out of bed. When I imagine the world VOYGR creates if it fully succeeds, I see incrementally better AI applications, not a fundamental shift in who has access to opportunity.

The co-founder dynamic is a question mark I can't resolve from the available information. Vlad and Yarik may have overlapped at Google, but there's no confirmed shared history, and I have no sense of how they navigate disagreement. After HQ Trivia taught me how badly co-founder conflict can destroy even a perfect-timing company, I need to understand this before writing a check. No red flags, but no comfort either.
