# Ressl AI -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking fact about Ressl AI is that Founders Fund already backed their most dangerous competitor. Netic has raised $43 million -- $23 million of it in a Series B led by my own fund -- and has grown revenue 1,700% in under a year, building autonomous AI agents for essential service businesses at a $450 million valuation. The competitive landscape here is not ambiguous. When I ask "what is the secret?" about Ressl AI, the answer is uncomfortably clear: there is no secret. The insight that trades businesses employ too many people doing manual administrative work is shared by Netic, Avoca, ServiceTitan's AI product team, Supernal, and apparently every investor who has written checks into this space. A truth that a dozen companies and their backers all simultaneously discovered is not a secret -- it is a consensus view that has already attracted serious capital. The entire category is a textbook case of mimetic convergence: companies imitating each other's thesis, competing for the same PE roll-up buyers and shop operators, burning capital to match each other's integrations. This is exactly the competitive structure I avoid.

The pivot history compounds the concern. Ressl AI started as an "AI consulting firm talking to businesses across every industry," then built an AI Salesforce administration tool (which generated $440K in revenue), and has now repositioned as an AI agent platform for trades businesses. The founders describe identifying trades as the segment with the most "glue work" -- but this process of exploring, testing, and pivoting is precisely the indefinite optimism I reject. It is the lean startup method by another name: iterate across industries until something sticks. Compare this with how Palantir was built. We did not start as a consulting firm that talked to companies across every industry and eventually discovered intelligence agencies had a data problem. We started with a specific secret -- that PayPal's anti-fraud algorithms could be adapted for counterterrorism -- and built the company around that thesis from day one. Ressl AI's trajectory suggests founders who are skilled at building products (the Salesforce revenue proves execution ability) but who lack a definite vision of the future they are creating. They found a market through exploration, not through conviction.

The technology does not escape the competition trap. LLM agents interacting with APIs -- CCCOne, QuickBooks, scheduling tools -- is an application of generally available capabilities, not proprietary technology. The dossier explicitly flags this: "The underlying technology stack is accessible to well-funded competitors." There is no 10x technological discontinuity here. Replacing a human admin with an AI agent is a quantitative improvement in cost, not a qualitative leap in what is possible. Every AI agent company in 2026 claims to replace human workers; the question is whether the underlying technology creates a structural barrier to replication. In Ressl AI's case, the answer is no. ServiceTitan, with its existing customer relationships, data, and distribution, can build competing agent functionality and bundle it into existing contracts. A startup that depends on incumbents keeping their APIs open and not building competing features is a startup whose existence is contingent on its competitors' strategic choices.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: first, that the PE roll-up distribution channel gives Ressl AI a structural advantage that Netic (with $43 million and Founders Fund's network) cannot replicate; second, that the integration complexity across fragmented trades software creates a compounding data and workflow moat over time; and third, that ServiceTitan's business model conflict -- the risk that autonomous agents cannibalize their per-seat pricing -- creates a window long enough for a startup to reach escape velocity. If all three are true, and if the founders' pivot reflects genuine market intelligence rather than indecision, then Ressl AI could become the Palantir of trades operations: deeply embedded in workflows, impossible to rip out, with switching costs that compound over years. The PE channel is genuinely clever -- a single relationship unlocking dozens of locations is high-leverage distribution. But "clever GTM strategy" is not a secret. Netic can pursue the same PE relationships with fifty times the capital and a twelve-month head start. The window is closing if it was ever open.

The go-to-market strategy also violates my small-market principle. Ressl AI targets HVAC, plumbing, electrical, collision repair, and roofing simultaneously -- five distinct sub-verticals, each with different core software systems, different workflows, and different integration requirements. This is not the Facebook-at-Harvard strategy of dominating a tiny market first. This is going after a large, fragmented market on day one, which I have consistently identified as competitive rather than monopoly thinking. A company that tried to monopolize collision repair estimation -- just that one workflow in that one sub-vertical -- would have a more defensible position than one spreading across five verticals with a four-person team against a $43 million competitor.

I pass. The absence of a genuine secret, the mimetic competition with well-funded players (including one in my own portfolio), the pivot-driven founding story, and the commoditizable technology stack all point in the same direction. Competition in this space has already begun in earnest, and competition destroys value for everyone.
