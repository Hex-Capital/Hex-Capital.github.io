# AutoSitu -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

AutoSitu has listed eight of America's largest cities as clients -- San José, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Long Beach, Honolulu -- as a two-person pre-seed company. That is genuinely unusual traction at this stage, and I want to acknowledge it before I explain why it doesn't change my conclusion. Because the question I ask first is never "does this company have traction?" It's "if this company succeeds completely -- dominates its category, captures every customer it could -- does the world operate differently?" And the answer here is: municipal plan reviews go from 3-9 months to maybe 1-3 months. That's a real improvement. It's not a transformation. The housing crisis in America costs trillions in lost economic output, but the bottleneck is not a slow-moving city reviewer -- it's zoning laws written to prevent density, NIMBYism codified into political incentive structures, and construction economics that punish multifamily development. AutoSitu makes one bureaucratic step faster. The consequence of success is a good business serving government agencies, not the reorganization of how America builds housing.

The TAM tells the story clearly: $1.25 billion in permit management software growing to $3.72 billion by 2033. That's a perfectly respectable software market. It's also a market where the ceiling on any single company's outcome is constrained by the spending patterns of 19,000 municipal governments operating on taxpayer budgets with long procurement cycles. Compare that to the markets my highest-conviction investments attacked: Juniper went after the multi-hundred-billion-dollar networking infrastructure market, Impossible Foods went after a $1.7 trillion meat industry, OpenAI went after the entire knowledge economy. AutoSitu is competing for a share of a $3.7 billion market against PermitFlow ($90.5 million raised), CivCheck (acquired by Clariti), Blitz AI, CodeComply, and Cembla. That's five named competitors in a market that barely registers as a rounding error in the broader construction economy. The ambition has been calibrated to fit the niche rather than the problem.

What concerns me most about the founding team -- and this will sound counterintuitive because most investors would see it as a strength -- is that they are exactly the right people for this problem. Xuanshu Lin has a Harvard GSD urban planning degree, experience with municipal planning projects, an APA award. He knows how city reviewers think, what zoning codes look like, what the workflow pain points are. George Zhai brings Georgia Tech AI and robotics capability. Domain expert plus AI engineer -- it's a logical, well-matched pairing. But I've learned that founders who understand their industry deeply tend to build what the industry will accept rather than what would replace it. The "human-in-the-loop" positioning is revealing: it signals they've designed the system to fit within existing municipal power structures rather than to challenge them. They've reduced the probability of failure -- city reviewers aren't threatened by a copilot -- but they've also constrained the consequences of success. The system will never eliminate the reviewer, never collapse the 2-3 resubmittal cycle to zero, never make the current approach structurally obsolete. It will make it incrementally better. That's the trap of domain expertise: you know what's politically feasible, so you build for feasibility instead of for impact.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that the Code & Precedent Graph becomes a genuine data moat deepening with every jurisdiction onboarded; that the political urgency around housing (California's governor announcing AI for permits in April 2025) creates a wave of municipal adoption that lets AutoSitu reach hundreds of cities before PermitFlow's $90.5 million catches up; and that once embedded in municipal workflows, AutoSitu expands from plan review into broader city planning intelligence that transforms how cities make development decisions. If all three are true, you have a category-defining govtech platform with a defensible data asset and high switching costs. Tyler Technologies is worth roughly $20 billion, and it got there by becoming the embedded operating system for local government. AutoSitu could theoretically follow that trajectory. But that path requires the founders to demonstrate ambition far beyond what they've articulated -- moving from "50-70% fewer city comments" to fundamentally reimagining urban governance. Nothing in the dossier suggests they're thinking at that scale.

The timing is the one dimension where AutoSitu genuinely earns its place. Vision models crossed a capability threshold in 2023-2024 that makes parsing architectural drawings feasible for the first time. Municipal staff shortages post-COVID created real demand. State-level political pressure to accelerate housing is creating top-down procurement urgency. This is a legitimately well-timed company -- building before the wave crests but after the enabling technology arrived. If I were advising a fund that specialized in govtech workflow automation, I'd say this is a strong bet within that category. But I don't invest in categories where the maximum outcome is a well-run SaaS business serving a constrained buyer base. The founders are too capable to spend their careers making bureaucracy marginally more efficient. The problem worth solving isn't faster plan review -- it's why we need the plan review process at all.
