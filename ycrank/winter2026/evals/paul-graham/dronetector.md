# DroneTector -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about DroneTector is the competitive landscape, and it's not encouraging. Robin Radar already does micro-Doppler drone detection and generated €43 million in revenue in 2023. DroneShield posted $57.5 million in FY2024. Dedrone got acquired by Axon. Fortem Technologies has $79 million in backing from Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is not a problem hiding in plain sight. This is a problem that multiple well-funded, scaling companies are already attacking. When I talk about schlep blindness -- the unconscious avoidance of hard problems that leaves opportunities sitting untouched -- the critical word is "untouched." Drone detection in 2026 is not untouched. It's a battlefield, and the incumbents have real revenue, real deployments, and real distribution. The question for DroneTector is not "is this problem real?" but "is there a specific technical wedge sharp enough to cut through established competitors?"

The answer might be yes, and the reason lives in Matthew Moore's PhD. His doctoral research at St Andrews was specifically on 94 GHz millimeter-wave radar for drone micro-Doppler signatures. Not radar generally. Not drones generally. The exact intersection of technology and application that DroneTector is commercializing. He published peer-reviewed validation of this approach and his research was co-funded by QinetiQ, a major UK defense contractor. This is the hard-tech equivalent of organic problem discovery: Moore didn't read a market report about counter-drone spending and decide to build a company. He spent years in a lab developing the specific technology, understood its capabilities and limitations intimately, and recognized the commercial gap. It's academic-organic rather than lived-pain-organic -- he wasn't getting attacked by drones, he was building the radar that detects them -- but it's genuine. The problem grew from the work, not the other way around. And the schlep is real: defense procurement cycles of 12-36 months, 94 GHz component sourcing, export controls, security clearances, hardware manufacturing at scale. Most YC founders unconsciously filter out everything about this sentence. These three didn't.

What concerns me is the gap between technical depth and commercial readiness. Three PhDs with no visible startup experience, no public GitHub repos, no demonstrated prototype outside academic work, and no revenue. The "Request a Demo" button on their website is the only signal that something buildable exists. NATO DIANA participation and DASA support are credentialing -- they open doors in defense procurement -- but they're not customer contracts. They're the defense-tech equivalent of getting into an accelerator. More troubling, the CTO is listed as co-founder and CEO of a separate company called Quantum Fabrix. On a three-person team, divided attention from a key technical co-founder is not a minor concern. It's the kind of thing that breaks companies when the hard months arrive. I also can't fully assess the co-founder relationships: Moore and Francès de Mas overlapped at St Andrews, which is encouraging, but Doherty was at Oxford and the connection appears to be the RAEng Enterprise Fellowship program. Three people who met through a fellowship program and decided to start a company together is not the same as co-founders with years of shared history.

The bull case is that DroneTector's 94 GHz millimeter-wave approach represents a genuine performance discontinuity on nano drones -- the $50 targets that are too small for lower-frequency radar to reliably detect. If that's true, and if the Ukraine conflict and proliferating commercial drones compress defense procurement timelines, then DroneTector could carve out a defensible niche that Robin Radar and DroneShield can't easily replicate at their operating frequencies. The RAEng fellowships and NATO DIANA participation give them institutional access that most pre-seed hardware startups lack. Moore's QinetiQ connection provides a warm path into UK defense. And the market tailwinds are real -- 20-27% CAGR driven by genuine urgency, not hype. If everything breaks right, this is a version of the Boom Supersonic thesis: a frighteningly ambitious hard-tech bet where deep technical conviction and massive schlep create structural barriers to competition. The difference is that Boom operates in a market with essentially zero direct competitors building supersonic commercial aircraft, while DroneTector enters a market where four companies with $50M+ in combined revenue already sell drone detection systems.

I keep coming back to the competitive question. The schlep framework works best when the schlep has kept everyone away. Here, the schlep slowed people down but didn't stop them. Robin Radar has 200+ radars deployed in Ukraine. DroneShield has contracts with the US military. Dedrone has Axon's distribution network. DroneTector's claim is that 94 GHz provides better detection of nano drones than these alternatives -- but that claim is unvalidated commercially. A PhD thesis proving it works in a lab is not the same as proving it works in a dusty forward operating base or on an airport perimeter in January rain. I'd want to see a single real-world deployment, a single defense customer saying "this detects things our current system misses," before I'd have conviction. Without that, I'm betting on a technical claim against scaled competitors, which is a different risk profile than betting on founders attacking an unseen problem.
