# Sonarly -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that jumped out at me about Sonarly is the tension between a genuine organic origin and a consensus category. The founders were running Meoria at 100,000 users and drowning in 50 alerts a day from Sentry and Datadog. They didn't go looking for a startup idea in the AI-for-DevOps space -- the problem found them. That part is real. But alert fatigue is not a problem hiding in plain sight. It's discussed at every engineering conference, written about on every DevOps blog, and actively being addressed by PagerDuty, incident.io, BigPanda, Keep, and the monitoring platforms themselves. When I wrote about schlep blindness, I was describing problems people unconsciously avoid because the work is so ugly that their brains filter the idea out before it even forms. Payment processing sat there for a decade because dealing with banks and fraud and PCI compliance was genuinely repulsive. Alert triage involves API integrations and LLM prompting -- that's work, but it's not the kind of work that repels founders. The proof is that at least five well-funded companies are already doing it.

The organic discovery earns real points. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer is satisfying: they were living it. Two students running a consumer app that scaled faster than they expected, and the alert noise became personally unbearable. That's the right kind of origin story. But organic discovery is necessary and not sufficient. Dropbox was organic -- Drew kept forgetting his USB drive -- but the reason Dropbox won was that the technical execution was extraordinary and the product was so obviously better that it spread on its own. Here I'm looking at a team building what is essentially an LLM wrapper on top of monitoring APIs, in a market where the dossier itself acknowledges "any team with LLM access and API integrations to Sentry/Datadog could build a basic version." A Hacker News commenter described building the same thing with GitHub Actions and Claude, getting 30% mergeable PRs. That's a data point that should worry these founders.

The Meoria execution is the strongest signal in the whole dossier. Getting a consumer app to 100,000 users and 40,000 downloads in seven months, as university students in France, is not nothing. It tells me these founders can ship and grow a product. It reminds me a little of how we evaluate young hackers -- Steve Huffman was 22 when he built Reddit, and what mattered wasn't his resume but that he'd actually built something people used. These two have that signal. But Meoria was a free app for French high school students navigating their university application system. The leap from there to selling B2B developer tools to American engineering teams is enormous. The domain knowledge, the sales motion, the buyer persona -- everything changes. And I notice neither founder has a visible GitHub profile or public repositories. For a developer tools company targeting engineers, the absence of any public technical signal is uncomfortable. I want to see code from founders who are selling to people who write code.

If I try to construct the bull case: the OpsGenie sunset is creating genuine switching urgency. LLM capabilities are crossing a threshold. These founders are young, hungry, and already proved they can ship. Jared Friedman is their YC partner, which suggests someone smart sees potential. If Sonarly can genuinely reduce 180 alerts to 5 actionable ones -- if that claim holds up in practice -- then the product sells itself, and the "internal map of the production system" gets richer with every customer, creating a compounding data advantage. The best version of this story is that everyone else is building generic AI alert correlation, while Sonarly builds deep, customer-specific production maps that make their triage radically better over time. In that world, the early movers who capture engineering teams during the OpsGenie migration have a real wedge. I'd need to see evidence that the triage quality is genuinely differentiated -- not just "we use Claude" but something architecturally deeper that would be hard to replicate. Right now that evidence isn't in the dossier.

The core problem is competitive structure. When I look at a market where PagerDuty has $494M in ARR and is building AI triage, incident.io just raised $62M for AI-assisted incident response, and BigPanda has $340M in funding for AIOps correlation -- and then I see a pre-seed company with two university dropouts, no public pricing beyond a free tier, no visible users, and no revenue -- the math doesn't work for me as an angel bet. The idea is not wrong. The founders are not bad. But the category is hot enough that every investor and every incumbent is already here. That's exactly the situation where I think the upside has been priced out. My instinct with crowded consensus categories has been consistent: the most interesting companies I see are usually working on things nobody else thinks are important yet. This is the opposite of that.
