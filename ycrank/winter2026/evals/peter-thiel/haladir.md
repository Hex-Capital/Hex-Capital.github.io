# Haladir -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking fact about Haladir is that it is trying to serve two masters simultaneously and has not yet decided which one it serves. The GitHub organization describes "AI-Enabled Mainframe Modernization and Code Translation." The YC tagline reads "Bridging the Gap between Solvers and Training." One product is a COBOL-to-modern-language documentation tool called Rosetta, aimed at enterprise mainframe customers. The other is OR-bench, a benchmark of operations research tasks designed as RL training infrastructure for frontier AI labs. These are not the same company. They serve different buyers, require different go-to-market motions, and demand different forms of credibility. When a pre-seed team of four undergraduates pursues both, this is not strategic breadth — it is the absence of a definite plan. And the absence of a definite plan is the most reliable signal I know that a founder has not identified a genuine secret about the world.

What is the secret here? The implicit thesis is that classical solver domains — vehicle routing, facility location, job shop scheduling, formal verification — represent an underexploited source of verifiable reward signals for reinforcement learning, and that AI labs will pay for this data. But this is not a secret. It is a market observation. Every AI researcher working on RLVR understands that diverse verifiable domains improve model reasoning. The insight that operations research problems have computable ground-truth solutions is taught in undergraduate optimization courses. When I look for a contrarian truth — something most intelligent people would actively argue against — I find nothing here that provokes disagreement. "AI labs need more diverse training data" is consensus dressed in slightly unusual clothing. Contrast this with the founding insight behind Palantir: that PayPal's anti-fraud algorithms could be repurposed for counterterrorism intelligence. That was a secret — it connected two domains in a way that the intelligence community dismissed and Silicon Valley had not imagined. Haladir's connection between OR solvers and RL training is logical, obvious, and therefore not a foundation for monopoly.

The competitive landscape confirms the diagnosis. Applied Compute, founded by ex-OpenAI researchers, has raised over $100 million and is valued at $1.3 billion. Mechanize has a direct partnership with Anthropic. Scale AI, at a $29 billion valuation, has a dedicated RL environments team. Haladir's claim to differentiation is domain specificity — OR and formal verification rather than coding tasks — but this lateral positioning within an already-crowded category is precisely the kind of move that mimetic competition produces. Everyone is building RL environments; Haladir has chosen a slightly different flavor. A slightly different flavor of the same competitive category is not a monopoly strategy. The underlying technology — OR-Tools, TLA+ provers — is open-source. If Anthropic or OpenAI decides they want solver-domain training data, they can build the pipeline internally, or any of the well-funded competitors can expand sideways into OR problems within months. There is no proprietary technology barrier, no network effect, and no economy of scale that would prevent replication.

The founding team deserves serious consideration despite — or perhaps because of — their youth. I have backed teenagers before. Zuckerberg was 19. Buterin was 19 when he received the Thiel Fellowship. Age is irrelevant when conviction and technical depth are extraordinary. But the evidence here does not show extraordinary conviction. It shows four undergraduate students with relevant academic backgrounds — CMU Statistics/ML, Princeton CS, UVA Applied Math — and no prior industry experience, no published research beyond an ORCID identifier, and no visible track record of building anything substantial. The OR-bench repository has zero stars. The MOBOL COBOL tool has five. The Rosetta product is in request-access mode with no disclosed waitlist. I need to see a founder who has a specific, concrete vision for how the world looks when they succeed and who has already demonstrated willingness to endure pain in pursuit of that vision. What I see instead is a team exploring multiple product directions — a pattern more consistent with lean-startup iteration than with definite optimism.

The strongest bull case would require the following to be true: that AI labs' demand for non-coding verifiable domains explodes so rapidly that first-movers in OR/formal-verification training data capture durable relationships before better-funded competitors expand into the niche; that the COBOL modernization product is not a distraction but rather a clever dual-use strategy where enterprise code translation generates formally verifiable training data as a byproduct; and that these undergraduate founders possess a depth of operations research and formal methods expertise that their public profiles do not yet reveal. If all three conditions hold, Haladir could own a meaningful segment of the RL infrastructure market. But each condition requires a leap of faith unsupported by current evidence. The OR-bench repository — the company's primary public artifact demonstrating domain expertise — has attracted zero GitHub stars. The COBOL-to-RL-training-data pipeline is an inference, not an articulated strategy. And the competitive moat depends on interdisciplinary expertise that, even if present, can be hired by any team with $100 million in the bank.

The name Haladir appears to be drawn from Tolkien — the same source I chose for Palantir. But a name is not a strategy. Palantir was built on a genuine secret about what intelligence analysis could become, with a co-founding team that included the engineers who had already proven the concept at PayPal. Haladir is built on a market gap observation, with a team that has not yet demonstrated the depth required to exploit it before well-capitalized competitors close the gap. This is a pass.
