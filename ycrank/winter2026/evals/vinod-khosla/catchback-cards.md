# CatchBack Cards -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's a company that has applied genuinely sophisticated technology -- cryptographic randomness proofs, on-chain verifiable computation via a Layer 1 blockchain, open-sourced verification code -- to the problem of making Pokémon mystery packs more trustworthy. Let me be direct: this is an inversion of what I spend my career looking for. I look for naive outsiders applying ambitious but unproven approaches to massive problems. CatchBack is technically capable people applying proven approaches to a small problem. The cryptographic verification architecture is real engineering. If you told me these founders were using that same capability to make pharmaceutical supply chains provably uncontaminated, or to create verifiable randomization in clinical trials, I'd lean forward. Instead, it verifies that your $25 mystery pack of trading cards was fairly shuffled. The technology is more interesting than the problem it serves.

Let me start where I always start: if CatchBack succeeds completely -- dominates the trading card mystery pack market, becomes the trust standard for randomized commerce in collectibles -- what changes? Collectors get a more trustworthy way to buy packs. Sellers get better liquidity through guaranteed buyback. The $8-20 billion trading card market becomes marginally more efficient. Nobody's food system changes. No energy grid gets disrupted. No healthcare outcome improves. Whatnot proved you can build an $11.5 billion business in trading card commerce, so yes, there's a business here. But a business outcome is not the same as an industry transformation. The consequence of success is a consumer entertainment optimization, and that's where I disengage. The founders have reduced their probability of failure -- choosing a validated market, a known consumer behavior, an existing demand pattern -- to the point where the upside scenario is a nice marketplace business in a niche vertical.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. $13,000 MRR with 700 users roughly four weeks after launch is strong early traction by any measure. Five app versions shipped in four weeks demonstrates a team that iterates fast -- that's the kind of velocity signal I pay attention to when evaluating learning rate. The Steph Curry collaboration, if it materializes, could be a distribution accelerant. And there's a version of this thesis where "provably fair randomized commerce" becomes a category that extends beyond trading cards into gaming loot boxes, luxury mystery boxes, any domain where consumers pay for randomized outcomes and currently have zero verification. That category-creation angle is the only version of this company that would interest me. But the dossier shows a team building a trading card platform, not a trust infrastructure company. The positioning, the branding, the TikTok content, the Pokémon-card-focused go-to-market -- everything points to a consumer entertainment product, not a foundational technology play.

Joseph Zhang is clearly talented -- Stanford CS with an AI concentration, Gates Scholar, ISEF finalist, built at AWS and Nexus. But talented people building in safe markets is one of the most common patterns in Silicon Valley, and one of the most wasteful. "Quit his job to sell Pokémon cards" shows some willingness to take an unconventional path, but it's not the same as attacking a problem that experts declare impossible. Nobody told Zhang that trustworthy mystery packs couldn't be built -- it just hadn't been prioritized. That's a market gap, not a contrarian bet. The co-founder Sophia Kim is essentially invisible in public sources, which makes this functionally a single-visible-founder company at a stage where team breadth matters for navigating inventory risk, regulatory complexity, and consumer brand building simultaneously.

The competitive landscape reinforces my concern. DOPA already has 100,000+ daily users in Japan and is entering the U.S. market. Whatnot has $968 million in funding and $6 billion in GMV. TCGplayer was acquired by eBay for $295 million. CatchBack is entering a market where well-capitalized incumbents already operate and where the differentiation -- user-customized packs with cryptographic verification -- is a feature advantage, not a structural disruption. Any of these incumbents could add verification to their existing platforms. The open-sourcing of the randomness code, while building trust, simultaneously hands competitors the blueprint. This is not the dynamic I saw with Juniper, where TCP/IP routing required a fundamentally different architecture that Cisco's CTO said they would never build. This is a feature that could be bolted onto existing infrastructure.

I tell founders like Zhang the same thing: you are too capable to spend your career making mystery packs slightly more trustworthy. The cryptographic verification skill set, the blockchain infrastructure knowledge, the rapid iteration ability -- apply those to a problem whose consequence of success justifies the talent being deployed. Find something that terrifies you and matters at civilizational scale. This is a pass.
