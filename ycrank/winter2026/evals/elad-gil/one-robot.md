# One Robot -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I look at here is the competitive dynamics, because they're unusual. One Robot is building task-specific world models for VLA training -- essentially learned simulators for robot manipulation -- at a moment when NVIDIA is giving away general-purpose simulation tools for free. Cosmos ships with 20 million hours of training data. Isaac Sim is Apache 2.0. Runway has $860 million in funding and just launched GWM Robotics. Google DeepMind and Meta are building internally. When the infrastructure layer is being commoditized by a $3 trillion company as a strategic loss-leader to sell more GPUs, you need an extremely clear answer to why a startup captures value here. PagerDuty survived in a world where AWS had monitoring tools because PagerDuty solved a specific operational workflow AWS didn't care about. The question is whether "deformable-object manipulation simulation" is that kind of niche -- too specific and data-intensive for NVIDIA's horizontal platform ambitions -- or whether it's a feature Cosmos adds in a quarterly update.

The structural moment is real, though. VLA models emerged as the dominant paradigm for robot manipulation policy learning across 2025-2026 -- Pi 0.5, SmolVLA, Gr00t 1.5 all shipped. These models are data-hungry. Physical robot data collection is slow and expensive. The gap between what VLA models need and what physical robots can produce is widening, not narrowing. Traditional simulators like MuJoCo require extensive manual environment authoring and struggle with deformable objects -- textiles, flexible materials, anything that doesn't behave like a rigid body. So there is a genuine data bottleneck, and learned world models that capture both physics and visuals from actual robot experience represent a fundamentally different approach. That's a real "why now." But "world models for robotics" isn't a non-obvious market anymore -- it's consensus-hot. NVIDIA, Runway, and 1X all validated the thesis publicly in the last twelve months. What might be non-obvious is the specific niche: contact-rich deformable-object manipulation. General-purpose world models struggle here because the physics are genuinely harder. If One Robot's specialization in this specific domain creates a data flywheel that general platforms can't replicate, there's a defensible position. But that's an "if" -- there's no public evidence of sim-to-real transfer success, customer validation, or even prototype performance metrics.

The founders bring genuine domain depth, which matters. Elton Shon spent five years at Tesla building factory automation systems and Dojo infrastructure -- he's lived inside the exact data bottleneck One Robot is targeting. Hemanth Sarabu has the ML research credentials (Georgia Tech ML with a 4.0, NASA JPL robotics, Google) plus something I weight heavily: he bootstrapped Crescer AI to profitability. That signal -- actually building a company that makes money, not just raising -- is more informative than most pedigree markers. Their shared experience at Industrial Next (YC W22), a robotics manufacturing startup, means they've tested their working relationship under the specific pressures of a hard-tech robotics company. These aren't tourists who pivoted into robotics because it's getting funded. They've been in this domain for years.

The bull case I have to take seriously: if you believe robotics manipulation is where mobile was in 2007, then whoever owns the training data infrastructure captures enormous value as the ecosystem scales. The data flywheel could be powerful -- each customer's task-specific robot data improves model fidelity for that manipulation domain, which attracts more customers working on similar tasks. The deformable-object specialization could be a genuine moat because the physics are hard enough that general-purpose platforms won't invest in solving them properly. And the founders are credible enough to execute. If the robotics simulation TAM is actually much larger than the $4.2 billion static estimate suggests -- because VLA model proliferation creates demand that doesn't exist yet in today's market sizing -- then this could be a meaningful infrastructure company. For this investment to work, you'd need to believe that task-specific learned simulation is a category distinct from general-purpose simulation, not a feature of it. That's a reasonable thesis, but it requires conviction I don't currently have.

Where I struggle is the product-to-distribution trajectory. The current product -- task-specific world models for manipulation -- is narrow. The path from "simulation environments for deformable objects" to "platform that every robotics team builds on" requires crossing from a niche tool to a distribution channel for training data, policy evaluation, deployment monitoring, and more. I see no evidence the founders have articulated this multi-product vision, and the TAM even at the optimistic end ($4.2B by 2033) is small relative to the scale of outcome I need for the investment to make sense. Compare this to Stripe, where the initial payments API immediately created a developer relationship that could distribute dozens of adjacent products. One Robot's initial wedge is technically deep but commercially narrow -- and narrowness combined with massive well-funded competitors in adjacent territory is a structural concern.

My overall read: real structural moment, strong founders, genuine technical insight about deformable-object simulation as a distinct problem. But the market is now consensus rather than non-obvious, the TAM is constrained, the competitive landscape includes players with orders-of-magnitude more capital and data, and there's no evidence yet of the sim-to-real transfer working or customers validating the approach. This is a competent team in a real market, but I need to see more evidence that the niche is defensible and the product can become a platform before I write a check.
