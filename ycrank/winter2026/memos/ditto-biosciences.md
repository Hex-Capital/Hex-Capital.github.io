## The Idea

**Problem:** Autoimmune diseases — including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and others — affect tens of millions of patients globally. Current treatments rely heavily on broad immunosuppression, which carries significant side-effect profiles. Drug discovery for these conditions is expensive and failure-prone: 90% of drugs fail in clinical trials (YC launch page, Feb 2026). The existing therapeutic landscape leaves substantial unmet need for targeted, effective immunomodulation.

**Approach:** Ditto Bio mines the genomes of parasites — viruses, ticks, and parasitic worms — that have evolved over millions of years to produce proteins capable of suppressing or redirecting the human immune system. Using AI-driven computational analysis, the company screens these genomes to identify proteins predicted to hit clinically validated immune disease targets, then engineers the most promising candidates into drug candidates. The company reports analyzing 1M+ proteins across primate-infecting organisms and identifying thousands of candidates with therapeutic potential, including proteins achieving binding affinities of 1–2 nM (YC launch page, Feb 2026). The company draws an analogy to prior nature-derived blockbuster drugs: aspirin (willow bark), penicillin (mold), GLP-1 agonists (Gila monster venom), and taxol (Pacific yew) (company website).

**Differentiation:** Unlike conventional de novo drug design or antibody-based approaches (e.g., Odyssey Therapeutics' computational chemistry pipeline, Apogee Therapeutics' engineered antibodies), Ditto Bio starts from naturally evolved immunomodulatory proteins that parasites have already "tested" against the human immune system. This contrasts with earlier helminth therapy attempts (e.g., Coronado Biosciences' TSO program, which used live pig whipworm and failed Phase 2 trials for Crohn's disease due to lack of efficacy (Chemistry & Biology, 2013)). Ditto's approach isolates and engineers the specific protein molecules rather than using live organisms. The company also notes that >98% of viral and parasite proteins remain uncharacterized (Fondo blog, Feb 2026), representing a large unexplored chemical space. Additionally, the team is building a tissue biobank mapping immune memory to parasite proteins, addressing the immunogenicity challenge common to protein therapeutics (YC launch page, Feb 2026).

**Business Model:** No pricing data is publicly available, consistent with the company's pre-clinical stage. [Inferred]: The most likely monetization path is pharmaceutical licensing, co-development partnerships with larger pharma companies, or proprietary drug development through the IND-to-clinical-trial pipeline — standard for pre-clinical biotech startups in drug discovery.

**TAM/SAM:** The autoimmune disease therapeutics market was valued at USD 116.79 billion in 2024, growing to USD 125.86 billion in 2025, with projections to reach USD 180.81 billion by 2030 at a 7.55% CAGR (Research and Markets, 2025 via search snippet). Other estimates place the 2025 market between USD 80.54 billion and USD 231.15 billion depending on scope and methodology (SNS Insider, 2025 via search snippet; Future Market Insights, 2025 via search snippet). No public SAM data found for the specific parasite-derived protein therapeutics sub-segment.

**GTM / Distribution:** [Inferred]: As a pre-clinical biotech, the most likely distribution path is through the pharmaceutical development pipeline — advancing lead candidates through preclinical validation and IND filing, then either partnering with or licensing to larger pharma for clinical trials and commercialization. The tissue biobank and proprietary protein database could also generate revenue through research collaborations or platform licensing deals.

## Defensibility

**Proprietary data asset:** The company reports having analyzed 1M+ parasite-derived proteins and identified thousands of candidates predicted to hit validated human immune targets (YC launch page, Feb 2026). Combined with a tissue biobank mapping immune memory to parasite proteins, this constitutes a growing proprietary dataset. The claim that >98% of viral and parasite proteins remain uncharacterized (Fondo blog, Feb 2026) suggests Ditto has first-mover advantage in systematically mining this space.

**IP potential:** Co-founder Adair Borges is a co-inventor on an anti-CRISPR protein patent (YC page), demonstrating the team's experience in filing and securing biotech IP. Any novel therapeutic proteins identified could be patentable compositions of matter — the strongest form of pharma IP.

**Technical complexity:** The approach requires deep interdisciplinary expertise at the intersection of parasitology, evolutionary biology, computational genomics, and protein engineering — a narrow talent pool.

**Market structure:** Large pharma companies are structurally oriented toward later-stage clinical development and established drug modalities (small molecules, monoclonal antibodies). Systematic mining of parasite genomes for immunomodulatory proteins represents a novel discovery paradigm that requires specialized scientific expertise in host-parasite biology and evolutionary genomics — capabilities not typically housed within incumbent pharma R&D organizations. [Inferred]: Incumbent pharma is more likely to partner with or acquire a company like Ditto than to build this capability internally, as the discovery platform falls outside their core competencies and established workflows.

**Commoditization risk:** Academic groups have published research on parasite-derived immunomodulatory proteins (e.g., studies on helminth-derived molecules in eBioMedicine, 2023; Frontiers in Microbiology, 2017). A well-funded biotech with computational biology talent could attempt a similar approach. However, Ditto's head start in building a curated database of 1M+ analyzed proteins, combined with proprietary experimental validation data and the tissue biobank, creates a compounding data advantage that would take time to replicate.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **Odyssey Therapeutics** — ~$700M total raised through Series D ($213M Series D, Sep 2025) (BusinessWire, Sep 2025 via search snippet). Computational immunology company developing both small-molecule and protein-based autoimmune therapies. Revenue unknown. Key differentiator vs. Ditto: Odyssey uses computational chemistry and AI on conventional drug targets, while Ditto mines an unconventional source (parasite biology) for novel protein candidates.

2. **Apogee Therapeutics** — Launched with $169M, now publicly traded (NASDAQ: APGE) (PR Newswire, 2022 via search snippet). Developing engineered antibodies for immunological and inflammatory disorders through a partnership with Paragon Therapeutics. Revenue unknown (clinical-stage). Key differentiator vs. Ditto: Apogee focuses on engineering best-in-class antibodies to known targets, while Ditto pursues entirely novel protein modalities derived from parasites.

3. **Topas Therapeutics** (Evotec spinoff) — Raised €40M (~$48M) Series B (Evotec press release via search snippet). Nanoparticle-based approach to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance by harnessing the liver's tolerization capabilities. Partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly. Revenue unknown. Key differentiator vs. Ditto: Topas uses synthetic nanoparticles for tolerance induction, while Ditto uses naturally evolved parasite proteins for immunomodulation.

4. **Coronado Biosciences** (now Windtree Therapeutics) — Previously developed live helminth (pig whipworm) therapy for autoimmune disease. TSO program failed Phase 2 clinical trials for Crohn's disease (2013) and the autoimmune program was discontinued (Chemistry & Biology, 2013; PMC, 2015). Key differentiator vs. Ditto: Coronado used live organisms, while Ditto isolates and engineers specific proteins — a fundamentally different approach that avoids the variability and regulatory challenges of live biotherapeutics.

**Why now:**
- [Inferred]: Advances in AI and computational protein analysis have made it feasible to systematically screen millions of parasite-derived proteins against known drug targets — a scale of analysis that was computationally impractical even a few years ago. The success of AI-driven drug discovery platforms (2025 saw the highest single-year jump in IND filings for AI-originated molecules (ScienceDirect, 2025 via search snippet)) validates the computational approach. Separately, the failure of prior helminth therapy approaches (live worm administration) has clarified that the opportunity lies in isolating specific immunomodulatory proteins rather than using whole organisms. The growing autoimmune disease market and increasing acceptance of biologic/protein therapeutics provide commercial tailwinds.

**Co-founder relationship:** All three founders worked together at Arcadia Science before founding Ditto Bio. The Fondo blog notes they "collaborated for three years as early scientists at another startup" before launching Ditto (Fondo, Feb 2026). They co-authored research publications at Arcadia Science, including work on PreHGT (horizontal gene transfer screening) and ProteinCartography (Arcadia Science PubPub). Adair Borges and Dennis Sun both had UC Berkeley affiliations (Miller Fellowship and PhD, respectively).

**Founder-market fit:** The founding team combines deep domain expertise directly relevant to the company's approach. Borges brings parasitology, virology, and CRISPR/phage biology from her UCSF PhD and Miller Fellowship — core to understanding host-pathogen immune evasion. Sun provides evolutionary and developmental biology training from Harvard and UC Berkeley, plus protein engineering expertise and biotech operational experience as a former Chief of Staff. Weiss contributes microbiology, genomics, and high-throughput screening capabilities from her PhD and industry experience at Illumina and DuPont. Their three years of collaboration at Arcadia Science — a biotech focused on emerging research organisms — directly prefigures Ditto's approach of mining non-model organisms for drug leads.

## Key Risks

**Clinical translation uncertainty:** Parasite-derived proteins are a novel therapeutic modality with no FDA-approved precedents. Prior attempts to use parasite biology therapeutically (Coronado Biosciences' live helminth therapy) failed in Phase 2 trials (Chemistry & Biology, 2013). While Ditto's approach of engineering isolated proteins differs fundamentally from live worm administration, the regulatory pathway and clinical efficacy for this class of molecules remain unvalidated. The binding affinity data (1–2 nM) is promising but represents early-stage characterization, not clinical proof of concept.

**Immunogenicity of parasite-derived proteins:** Foreign-origin proteins can trigger immune responses that neutralize the drug before it reaches its target. The company acknowledges this risk and is building a tissue biobank to map immune memory to parasite proteins (YC launch page, Feb 2026), but solving immunogenicity remains a central technical challenge for all non-human protein therapeutics. Failure to adequately address this could render otherwise promising candidates unviable.

**Capital intensity and timeline:** Drug development from discovery through clinical trials typically requires hundreds of millions of dollars and 10+ years. As a 3-person pre-seed company, Ditto will need to raise substantial follow-on funding to advance any candidates through preclinical development and IND filing. The competitive landscape includes companies with $100M–$700M in funding (Odyssey, Apogee, Topas) already in or near clinical stages.

**Platform vs. pipeline risk:** The company has identified "thousands" of promising proteins but has not disclosed specific lead candidates, target indication prioritization, or preclinical validation timelines. The transition from a broad computational screen to a focused therapeutic pipeline is a critical inflection point where many early-stage drug discovery companies stall.
