# Human Archive -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive structure here is the first thing that jumps off the page, and it tells the whole story. Scale AI -- $29 billion valuation, $2 billion in revenue, established annotation infrastructure, hundreds of global contractors -- entered robotics data collection in September 2025, collecting a thousand-plus hours per day. Two other YC companies, Sensei and Cortex AI, are already in the same category with different approaches. This isn't a market where you get paid for being right first. This is a market where everyone is already right and already racing. The asymmetric upside that makes angel investing work -- being non-consensus and correct -- is structurally absent when your thesis is the same thesis every robotics investor and data company arrived at simultaneously.

The specific knowledge question is where the deal breaks down for me. What do these founders know that Scale AI's Physical AI division doesn't? Samay Maini has ML experience from Berkeley and a stint at Contoro Robotics -- that's genuine relevance, but it's the kind of knowledge that exists in hundreds of Berkeley and Stanford ML labs. It's trained knowledge, acquirable through standard educational and professional pathways. Rushil Agarwal did product at Coinbase -- smart credential, zero transfer to robotics data collection. Raj and Shloke Patel co-founded a mango delivery operation and an agricultural fungicide startup. The charitable interpretation is that this gives them operational chops for deploying hardware across messy real-world environments. The honest interpretation is that selling mangoes and making fungicides doesn't give you non-transferable insight into what multimodal data representations robotics foundation models actually need. I want founders who have been immersed in the specific problem for years, who can tell me something about robotics training data that surprises me. The dossier offers a claim -- the team has "thought deeply about the fine line between biomimicry and its application to humanoid systems" -- but a claim is not knowledge, and a sentence on a YC page is not evidence.

The leverage architecture is my deepest concern. This is a business that requires deploying custom hardware to physical locations, hiring videographers and operations managers in India, running annotation and QA pipelines on collected footage, and delivering datasets to customers. Each hour of training data demands proportional human effort. That's the definition of an unleveraged business -- it scales linearly with headcount and hardware deployment, not exponentially through code or network effects. The data asset itself has some leverage properties: collect once, license to multiple labs. But the collection process has the economics of a services company, not a technology company. When I invested in Stack Overflow, the knowledge graph became more valuable with every question without proportional effort from the company. When I backed Replit, one engineer's work served millions of users. Here, one videographer's work produces one dataset. That's renting out operational effort, not creating a new form of leverage.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that real-world data is irreplaceable by synthetic alternatives for robotics training, that this team's custom hardware produces qualitatively superior data alignment compared to Scale AI's contractor approach, and that the cost advantage of India-based operations creates enough margin to build a durable business before Scale catches up. If all three are true, Human Archive could become essential infrastructure for the humanoid robotics wave. The Patel brothers' track record of running physical operations across geographies -- even if it was mangoes -- is at least evidence they can coordinate supply chains and manage distributed teams. And the customer base, while small today, could expand enormously if humanoid robotics delivers on its promise. I take this seriously. But "if three independent things all go right" is not the kind of bet structure I look for. I want one primary thesis that, if correct, guarantees an enormous outcome. Here, even if the market explodes, Scale AI's distribution advantage and established customer relationships mean Human Archive could be right about everything and still lose.

The absence of visible technical artifacts compounds my skepticism. Three of four founders have no public GitHub presence. Samay Maini has four repos with zero stars. The "custom hardware" is referenced but never described -- what sensors, what modalities, what design innovations? For a company whose entire value proposition is superior data collection technology, the lack of any demonstrable technical output is a structural concern, not a timing issue. I need a technologist on the founding team who has built something I can evaluate. Without that, I'm investing in an operations company with a hardware aspiration.

Four smart Berkeley and Stanford students spotted the robotics data opportunity at the same time as everyone else. They're executing in a direction that makes logical sense. But this is a consensus bet in a hot market with massive incumbent competition, pursued by a team without deep domain-specific knowledge, building an operationally intensive business that lacks the leverage mechanics I require. The compounding I look for -- where each iteration makes the technology harder to replicate and more valuable -- is absent. The data accumulates, but accumulation without a defensible collection advantage is just a head start that money can buy.
