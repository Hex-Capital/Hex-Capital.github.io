# Synthetic Sciences -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me immediately: this is one of the hottest categories in technology right now. Google announced their own AI Co-Scientist in February 2025. Periodic Labs just raised a $300 million seed round with Nvidia backing. Edison Scientific pulled in $70 million. Elicit is reportedly doing $18-22 million in ARR. And Sciloop -- another YC company, just one batch earlier -- is building essentially the same product for the same researchers. When I see a market where everyone's piling in and consensus has already formed that "AI for science is huge," something in my gut tells me to walk the other direction. The most promising companies I've backed were the ones nobody wanted. SpaceX was absurd. Uber was illegal. Crusoe was mining Bitcoin on gas flares. This? This is popular. It is not difficult to assess. And that means whatever edge exists will be competed away by teams with far more capital and infrastructure than a two-person pre-seed startup.

If I could sit down with Aayam and Ishaan and say "tell me your story -- not the business," I genuinely wonder what I'd hear. What the dossier reveals is remarkable accomplishment: 15+ papers at ICML, IEEE, and ACL by age 18, research stints across MIT CSAIL, CMU, Harvard, Oxford, Berkeley, Cambridge, NUS. A prior exit. IOAI participation. USACO Platinum. Z-Fellows and Emergent Ventures from Tyler Cowen. These are two of the most credentialed 18-year-olds in AI research anywhere on Earth. But credentials aren't what I'm listening for. I'm listening for the hardship that forged their commitment -- the specific struggle that means they won't quit when Google ships a competing feature or when Sciloop captures their target users. What I see here is two prodigies optimizing the academic track they're already excelling on. They're building a tool that makes their own workflow faster, which is rational and shows real founder-market fit in the credential sense. But it's not the biographical necessity I look for -- the founder whose life story and the company's mission are inseparable. I've learned that the founders who persist through genuine crisis are usually the ones who've already survived something harder than a startup.

The bull case deserves real engagement because it's not trivial. If the data flywheel thesis works -- product usage generating proprietary RL training data that makes the agents progressively more autonomous -- then early mover advantage in capturing ML researcher workflows could compound into something defensible. Elicit's traction at ~$18-22M ARR proves researchers will pay for AI tools, and Synthetic Sciences goes meaningfully further by orchestrating the full pipeline including GPU-provisioned experimentation, which neither Elicit nor Google's offering currently does. The $50/month entry point enables bottom-up PLG adoption. And the 93 pre-built research skills with 12 service integrations represent real integration work that creates switching costs. If I believed that being first to market with end-to-end execution would matter more than capital and distribution advantages, and if these two founders proved as relentless under pressure as their publication record suggests they are intellectually, this could be a very good outcome. What would have to be true: the integration layer itself becomes the moat, researchers lock in before competitors catch up, and the data flywheel kicks in fast enough to create separation.

But I keep coming back to what I don't see. I don't see how this creates economic access for people who currently lack it. The primary beneficiaries are computational researchers at funded institutions -- people who already have resources and opportunity. Uber created income for drivers who had none. Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out by banks. Postmates created work for people who needed it. Synthetic Sciences makes privileged work more efficient. There's an argument that cheaper research tools could democratize access for scientists at under-resourced universities, and I don't dismiss that entirely, but it's a stretch compared to the direct economic impact I gravitate toward. This is a productivity tool for people who are already doing well, not a tool that reveals invisible systems or creates access where exclusion existed before.

The brand confusion between Synthetic Sciences and InkVell -- the dual naming, the separate domains, the earlier press describing a different product scope -- is a minor concern but it reflects something I notice: this feels like a company still figuring out what it is. The pivot from what was described as "an AI-powered platform addressing research and document productivity" to a full AI co-scientist platform is natural at this stage, but combined with the extremely young founding partnership (they've been working together since June 2025, less than a year), it makes me want to understand how these two handle disagreement when the next pivot comes. My HQ Trivia experience taught me that even brilliant co-founders with perfect timing and the right product can destroy everything through unresolved conflict. I don't see red flags in their dynamic, but I also don't see evidence of stress-testing. They connected through fellowship networks, they share similar backgrounds and interests -- that's fine, but harmony during the good times isn't what I'm evaluating.

This is a pass for me, and I want to be clear about why: it's not the founders' capability, which is exceptional, or the market, which is real. It's that this company sits squarely in consensus territory with well-capitalized competitors closing in from every direction, and the founding story -- while impressive -- doesn't give me the conviction signal I need to believe these two will navigate what's coming. I invest my own money. I take extraordinary risk, but I take it on outsiders building things nobody else believes in, not on smart people entering crowded races.
