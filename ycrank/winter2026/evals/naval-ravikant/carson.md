# Carson -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Carson's tagline tells you everything: "more capable than Cowork, more secure than OpenClaw." That's not a company defining a new category. That's a company positioning itself on a two-axis comparison chart against incumbents. Notion didn't launch as "better Evernote, prettier Google Docs." Uber wasn't "cheaper taxis, faster buses." When you define yourself relative to existing players, you've already conceded that they define the category and you're competing within it. Every comparison-based startup I've seen is playing the wrong game -- you don't get paid 1000x for being incrementally better on two dimensions in an existing category. You get paid for creating a dimension nobody was measuring.

The specific knowledge question is where I start, and here the answer is: relevant experience, not non-transferable knowledge. Sid Menon did secure deployment at Palantir. Ketan Agrawal did AI red-teaming at Robust Intelligence. These are legitimate credentials. But Palantir alone employs thousands of engineers working on secure infrastructure, and Robust Intelligence had an entire company of people studying AI vulnerabilities before Cisco bought them. The knowledge these founders carry is the kind that can be acquired by any strong engineer spending two years at the right company -- it's professional experience, not the obsessive domain insight that produces genuinely surprising observations. When I backed Twitter, Evan Williams could explain things about public communication that I'd never considered despite years of thinking about media. I don't see evidence that these founders possess an insight about enterprise AI security that would surprise Anthropic's own security team. Where's the theory for why adaptive task-specific interfaces are structurally superior to general-purpose agents? That's an assertion on the website, not demonstrated understanding.

The leverage architecture is the deeper problem. Carson is an application sitting on top of other people's models, sold through enterprise sales. Each new customer likely requires sales effort, implementation work, custom integrations -- the revenue scales linearly with headcount. There are no network effects described, no protocol dynamics, no user-generated content that makes the product better for the next user. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question and answer made the knowledge graph denser and harder to replicate. Or Alchemy, where every developer building on their API deepened the infrastructure moat. Carson's "adaptive interface generation" could theoretically accumulate useful task templates over time, but that's an inferred possibility, not a visible mechanism. What I see is an enterprise SaaS company with a sales-assisted motion -- and that's an unleveraged business dressed up in AI vocabulary.

The timing is the hardest part of the analysis, because the bull case sounds compelling on the surface. Enterprise panic about AI agent security is real -- CrowdStrike shipping removal tools for OpenClaw, Gartner calling it insecure, Meta banning it. Someone will sell secure AI agents to enterprises. But "everyone agrees this is a problem" is the definition of consensus, not contrarian timing. Runlayer already raised $11M from Khosla and signed eight unicorn customers. Anthropic announced enterprise features for Cowork literally on February 24, 2026. Microsoft Copilot already offers enterprise-grade AI agents at $30/seat with M365 integration. This isn't a market where Carson is right and everyone else is wrong -- this is a market where everyone is right and the question is who wins the execution race. A four-person pre-launch startup racing against Anthropic ($380B), Microsoft, Google, and a competitor with $11M and existing distribution is not the asymmetric bet I look for. The losses are capped at 1x, yes, but the probability-weighted upside is also capped when you're the smallest player in a consensus land grab.

The strongest bull case would require believing that task-specific adaptive interfaces are a genuinely different paradigm from general-purpose agents -- not just a feature, but a structural insight about how enterprise workers actually want to interact with AI. If Carson's founders had deep, demonstrated conviction that chat-based agent interfaces are fundamentally wrong for enterprise work, and could articulate a theory of human-agent interaction that competitors don't understand, that would be the kind of specific knowledge that changes my calculus. It would also require believing that compliance certifications and enterprise integration depth can be accumulated fast enough to create switching costs before Anthropic's enterprise features mature. There's a narrow window where this could work -- perhaps three to six months before the big platforms close the security gap. But I don't see evidence of the execution velocity or the distribution relationships needed to capture that window. Milan Bhandari's departure from Bolto, an active funded company he co-founded, raises a separate question about the commitment pattern -- is this the team that will grind through enterprise procurement cycles for a decade?

I keep coming back to the leverage test. The technology business rewards companies that create new forms of leverage -- new capabilities that didn't exist before, where one person's work serves a million users. Carson is applying existing capabilities (LLMs, UI generation, security controls) in a configuration optimized for enterprise buyers. That's a product, not a platform. It's a feature set competing against other feature sets, and the competitors have orders of magnitude more resources. I need to see a founder who knows something that can't be taught, building something that creates leverage that didn't exist before, at a time when most informed people think they're wrong. Carson has competent founders with relevant backgrounds, building something incremental in a market where everyone agrees they're right. That's the opposite of the bet I want to make.
