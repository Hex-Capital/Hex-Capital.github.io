# Stilta -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the entire story before I even reach the founders. Solve Intelligence has raised $55 million and is profitable with eight-figure ARR. DeepIP raised $15 million and hit seven-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics raised $21 million and grew ARR twenty-fold in six months. IPRally has $10.8 million and counts Nvidia and Dolby as customers. Rowan Patents was already acquired by Clarivate. Into this arena walks Stilta with $500,000 and four people. The question is not whether AI can improve patent workflows -- every dollar of the $100 million+ already invested in this space confirms that thesis. The question is whether there is a secret here, and the answer is manifestly no. When five funded startups and three legacy incumbents all converge on the same insight, that insight is consensus. Consensus is the opposite of a secret. The Girardian dynamic is textbook: these companies are imitating each other toward mutual destruction, competing for the same patent attorneys at the same law firms with functionally equivalent propositions. "AI for patents" in 2026 is what "social networking" was in 2005 after Friendster, MySpace, hi5, Bebo, and Orkut were already funded -- except Zuckerberg had a genuine secret about real identity and network density. I see no equivalent insight from Stilta.

The founders describe their differentiation as "end-to-end workspace versus point solutions" -- the "Cursor for patent attorneys." This is a product positioning strategy, not a contrarian truth about the world. No intelligent person would argue against the abstract proposition that an integrated workspace is superior to disconnected tools. The framing itself is borrowed: "Cursor for X" has become a mimetic template across Y Combinator, which means the positioning is literally an act of imitation. When your differentiation can be stated as "we do everything our competitors do, but in one place," you have described a feature roadmap, not a monopoly mechanism. Any of the better-funded competitors can -- and likely will -- expand their scope. Solve Intelligence already covers drafting, prosecution, office actions, and claim charting. The progression from point solution to platform is the natural trajectory of every SaaS company with traction and capital. Stilta is not racing toward a monopoly; it is arriving late to a market where others are already building the same platform.

The founding team compounds this concern. Four McKinsey and QuantumBlack consultants with Goldman Sachs polish but no documented experience in patent law, IP prosecution, or legal practice. I have seen this pattern before -- in cleantech, where companies were led by "men in suits" rather than engineers who understood the physics. Patent work has deeply specialized domain requirements: claim construction, prosecution strategy, jurisdictional nuances, the art of prior art search. These are not skills you acquire through management consulting. The team is strong in AI/ML deployment and enterprise sales, which is relevant but insufficient. When I backed Alex Karp at Palantir, his doctoral work in social theory gave him a framework for understanding intelligence analysis that no engineer alone could have developed. When I invested in Stripe, the Collison brothers had been programming since childhood and understood developer pain from the inside. I see no equivalent domain immersion here -- no patent attorney on the team, no evidence of deep obsession with the specific mechanics of IP work, no signal that these founders understand something about patent practice that the practitioners themselves do not yet see.

The strongest bull case would require believing that Stilta can out-execute four better-funded competitors simultaneously while building breadth rather than depth with a four-person team. The argument would go: legacy incumbents like Clarivate and LexisNexis cannot cannibalize their database-access business models to build agentic workflow tools; the specialized startups (Solve, DeepIP, Patlytics) will remain narrow; and Stilta's integrated workspace will create workflow lock-in that compounds over time, much as Stripe's developer platform became impossible to rip out. If patent firms consolidate their entire IP workflow into Stilta, switching costs could become substantial. The McKinsey network provides genuine enterprise access. And the market is real -- $42 billion in global IP law services, growing steadily with patent filing volumes. But this bull case requires multiple things to be simultaneously true: that no funded competitor pivots to end-to-end, that a four-person team builds legal-grade quality across FTO, monitoring, drafting, and strategy before running out of capital, and that firms adopt a standalone workspace from an unknown startup rather than an add-on to tools they already use (DeepIP's Microsoft Word integration is clever precisely because it meets attorneys where they already work). Each of these conditions is plausible; their intersection is not.

The company claims "up to approximately 60% reduction in manual work." Even taken at face value, this is a productivity improvement, not a technological discontinuity. It is not making a previously impossible thing possible; it is making an existing thing moderately faster. The underlying technology -- large language models with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic orchestration -- is broadly available. Every competitor has access to the same foundation models and can implement the same workflow patterns. The "source-backed, auditable AI outputs" emphasis is sensible engineering for the legal domain, but it is a product requirement that any competent team would implement, not a proprietary technological advantage. Nothing in the dossier suggests Stilta possesses a technical moat that would widen over time.

I pass. This is a competitive market with a consensus thesis, entered by competent but non-domain operators, with no visible secret, no monopoly mechanism, and no technological discontinuity. The "market is large" argument is precisely the trap -- a large, undifferentiated market with five funded players and no structural path to monopoly is where capital goes to die. Competition in AI-for-patents will drive margins toward zero for everyone, and Stilta is the least capitalized participant in the race.
