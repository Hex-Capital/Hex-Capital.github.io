# Seeing Systems -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment for European autonomous strike drones is as clear as any I've tracked in the last five years. Ukraine provided the battlefield proof. The European Commission responded with what it called a "once-in-a-generation surge" in defense investment. Germany alone awarded €900M in kamikaze drone contracts to three companies in November 2025. When I led Anduril's $450M Series D, the catalyst was a structural vacuum -- Google's Project Maven cancellation opened an entire category of AI-for-defense with no credible startup competitor. The vacuum was the opportunity. The question with Seeing Systems is whether European low-cost strike drones in 2026 still present a structural vacancy -- or whether this market has already transitioned into a crowded gold rush. Helsing has raised €1.4B and is producing thousands of strike drones. Shield AI has over $1B. Stark raised $62M from Sequoia and Peter Thiel. These aren't slide-deck competitors. The "why now" is powerful and multi-layered, but when every defense publication and every European VC fund sees the same inflection point, the market stops being non-obvious.

What partially redeems the competitive concern is the founder positioning. Alexander Le Maitre designed EOD training and diagnostic hardware at Wildcat I.S. that's currently deployed by NATO, the European Defence Agency, US Federal agencies, and Special Forces units across Europe and the UK. That's not a pitch-deck relationship with the military -- it's fielded hardware in operational environments. The fact that Seeing Systems is already shipping prototypes to UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces at the pre-seed stage, on $500K, is a genuine execution signal. Matthew brings the software discipline -- Cambridge MEng (top-ranked) in computer science with a dissertation on autonomous vehicle systems, plus Jane Street engineering rigor. The hardware-software founder pairing maps precisely to the two core competencies this company requires. Alexander builds the platform; Matthew builds the autonomy stack. Brothers as co-founders reduce the co-founder conflict risk that kills pre-product-market-fit companies, though it also narrows the network.

The critical question I apply to every defense hardware company: is this software-driven or software-aware? A drone with AI bolted on is a smart toaster -- it's still fundamentally a hardware commodity play where Chinese manufacturers will undercut you on cost. But if the agentic AI control system is what enables autonomous operation in GPS-denied, electronically contested environments, and if the hardware modularity creates a platform where software capabilities are continuously distributed to fielded systems, then software is the fundamental competitive layer. The difference matters enormously for defensibility and margins. Seeing Systems claims the agentic control system is the core differentiator, and the autonomy use case -- operating without GPS in electronic warfare environments -- is genuinely hard to replicate. But I'd want to see evidence that the software stack creates compounding advantage, not just a feature. The modularity concept has real product-to-distribution potential: if the base platform becomes adopted, new payloads, sensors, and autonomy capabilities can be pushed through the installed base, inverting the traditional defense upgrade cycle from "replace the whole platform every decade" to "swap modules and ship software continuously." That's a distribution story. But it's speculative at this stage.

The capital asymmetry is the elephant in the room. $500K for a hardware defense company competing against entities with 1,000x more funding is not a typical pre-seed constraint -- it's a structural challenge. Hardware requires supply chain management, manufacturing to military specifications, and working capital that software companies never face. Anduril needed billions to reach production scale. The Le Maitre brothers will need substantial follow-on capital within months, not years, to convert prototype relationships into production contracts before competitors lock up procurement slots. The question is whether YC brand, existing military relationships, and prototype validation create enough signal to attract defense-focused growth capital. Given Europe's defense spending trajectory, I think the capital is available -- but the race is real.

The bull case I'd need to believe: European defense procurement is entering a structural expansion comparable to post-9/11 US spending, the UK will specifically prioritize domestic suppliers for strategic autonomy (making a UK-based company structurally advantaged over Helsing in Germany or Anduril in the US), and the modular platform approach creates a winner in the low-cost expendable segment where fixed-design competitors like Stark are failing -- all four of Stark's strikes failed in military trials despite $62M in funding and marquee backers. Defense is not winner-take-all; NATO deliberately diversifies suppliers for resilience. A UK company with existing Royal Marines relationships and a working modular platform doesn't need to beat Helsing -- it needs to capture its share of a rapidly expanding budget pool. If European defense budgets expand as projected, multiple companies will win production contracts. The real question is whether Seeing Systems can scale manufacturing fast enough to claim its allocation.

But I keep hitting the multi-miracle problem. This company needs military-grade hardware manufacturing at scale, differentiated autonomous AI that works in contested electromagnetic environments, procurement wins against far better-capitalized competitors, and export control navigation across multiple NATO jurisdictions. The existing Wildcat I.S. relationships reduce the customer access challenge from a miracle to a checkpoint. But hardware manufacturing scale-up and capital acquisition remain genuine additional obstacles that I can't reduce to checkboxes. I'm comfortable with regulatory complexity as a moat -- that's a pattern I've invested through repeatedly. I'm less comfortable with the compounding execution risk when the founding team is two people with $500K building physical defense platforms. The domain expertise is real, the structural moment is real, the early military engagement is real. What's missing is evidence that the single-miracle framing applies here rather than the multi-miracle framing that makes me pass.
