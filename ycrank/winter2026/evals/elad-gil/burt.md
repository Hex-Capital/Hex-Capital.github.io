# Burt -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most revealing signal in this dossier isn't what the company is building — it's that the company can't decide what it's building. The YC page describes a horizontal model fine-tuning platform. The website describes logistics back-office automation. These are fundamentally different businesses with different markets, different customers, different distribution strategies, and different moats. When I see this kind of identity split at the pre-seed stage, it tells me the founders haven't answered the most basic strategic question: what's the one thing that must work? My single-miracle framework requires founders to name their critical obstacle in one sentence. Burt's team appears to be running two hypotheses simultaneously, which isn't resourcefulness — it's a compounding of risk. Two-person teams that split focus across different go-to-market motions tend to achieve zero product-market fit rather than two instances of it.

The structural moment question is where this falls apart for me. Ask "what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes managed fine-tuning possible now?" and the answer is: open-source base models proliferated and production AI deployments hit scale, making inference cost a real business metric. But that thesis was already clear by 2022-2023. Together AI has $300M+ in annualized revenue and $534M raised. Fireworks AI is at $280M ARR with $327M raised. These aren't early-stage competitors — they've made what I'd call market-ending moves in the horizontal fine-tuning space. When Predibase — a technically differentiated platform with published research (LoRA Land) and $28M in funding — gets absorbed by Rubrik rather than surviving independently, that's the market telling you something specific: standalone fine-tuning is being commoditized into feature-within-a-larger-stack. A two-person team entering this market now is arriving after the structural moment has already been captured. That's the Webvan timing problem in reverse — not too early, but too late.

The logistics vertical is actually the more interesting thread, and it's worth engaging with the bull case. Logistics is exactly the kind of "boring but critical" market where I've found asymmetric returns — Samsara built a multi-billion-dollar business in industrial IoT fleet management because the market was too physical, too fragmented, and too unglamorous for most software investors. If Burt's real strategy is to use fine-tuned VLMs as a technical wedge into logistics document processing — BOLs, invoices, rate confirmations — and then expand into a broader logistics operations platform, that product-to-distribution trajectory could be compelling. The structural moment for logistics automation is arguably real: VLM capabilities crossed a fidelity threshold in 2024-2025 that makes reliable document extraction possible for the first time. For this to work, the founders would need deep logistics domain expertise, a clear distribution strategy into freight brokers or 3PLs, and the conviction to commit entirely to this vertical. But the evidence doesn't support any of those conditions. Bobby Zhong's background is general software engineering and LLM work at YC startups — relevant technical skills, but no logistics domain depth. The distribution motion is a Cal.com booking link. And the continued presence of the horizontal fine-tuning positioning on the YC page suggests they haven't committed to the vertical bet.

The commoditization risk compounds the timing problem. Open-source frameworks — Axolotl, LLaMA-Factory, Unsloth — have made fine-tuning accessible to any competent ML engineer. The technical barrier to replicating what Burt describes is moderate at best. When I evaluate whether a company is "software-driven" versus "software-aware," I'm asking whether the software creates compounding, defensible value or whether it's a service layer that could be replicated. A managed fine-tuning service without proprietary data, proprietary techniques, or deep vertical expertise is a service business with service-business margins — not a technology company with technology-company defensibility. The dossier finds no patents, no significant open-source traction, no proprietary datasets. Without a structural moat, this is a consultancy that helps teams fine-tune models, competing against platforms with hundreds of engineers and thousands of customers.

On the founder side, Bobby Zhong shows the progression I look for in early-career builders — founding Educado, joining Pirros as the second engineer, building coding agents at Replo. He's shipped products and worked inside the LLM stack. But the CTO has essentially no public footprint, which for a technical product company is a gap I can't look past. The one cited case study — a custom VLM that was "~3x faster" than Gemini-3-Flash/Pro — is directionally interesting but unnamed and undated, which limits its evidentiary value. Overall, the execution signals are neutral for a pre-seed company: something has been built, but nothing suggests the velocity or domain depth that would overcome the competitive and structural headwinds.
