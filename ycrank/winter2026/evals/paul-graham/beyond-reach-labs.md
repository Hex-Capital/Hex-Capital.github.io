# Beyond Reach Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Mitchell Fogelson spent his entire PhD building the thing this company sells. Not studying the market for it. Not reading about space power demand in analyst reports. He was in a lab at CMU, funded by a NASA NIAC grant, designing and optimizing kilometer-scale deployable structures for space, then flying them on zero-gravity parabolic flights to see if they actually worked. The technology that Beyond Reach Labs is commercializing -- these scissor-truss architectures called PETS and HERDS -- literally emerged from years of doctoral research on mechanical metamaterials. And his co-founder Pele Collins spent seven years at SpaceX building flight hardware, including leading the engineering of the Crew Dragon parachute system that brought NASA astronauts home from the ISS for the first time since Apollo. These two met thirteen years ago as freshmen at UPenn. The idea didn't come from a brainstorming session. It grew from the deep soil of two careers spent inside exactly this problem space.

The schlep here is staggering. Everyone in the space industry knows power is the bottleneck. Current satellites collectively use about 20 MW; projected demand reaches 10 GW by 2030. That's obvious. What's also obvious is why nobody has solved it: building a new deployable solar array architecture for space means years of thermal vacuum testing, vibration qualification, radiation hardening, and the slow grind of earning flight heritage before any risk-averse satellite manufacturer will put your hardware on a $500 million spacecraft. This is schlep blindness operating at industrial scale. Thousands of aerospace engineers can describe this problem clearly. Almost none of them want to found the company that has to walk through the qualification gauntlet. Fogelson and Collins do, because they've already been doing the work for years -- Fogelson in the lab, Collins on the factory floor at SpaceX. The schlep doesn't scare them because they've been living inside it.

The $175M in LOIs is the signal I'd zero in on if I were at a Tuesday dinner at YC. LOIs from space companies are not like LOIs from SaaS prospects who sign anything to make a sales rep go away. Satellite programs have multi-year procurement cycles, extensive vendor qualification processes, and engineers who actually evaluate the physics. When multiple space companies collectively express $175M of interest in your deployable array technology, that's genuine pull -- even though LOIs are non-binding. It tells me that the technical community recognizes both the problem and the plausibility of this team's approach. Combined with the NASA NIAC grant, NSF funding, and an advisory board that includes a 25-year AFRL veteran who was Chief Scientist of the Space Vehicles Directorate, there's a pattern of sophisticated technical stakeholders validating this work.

This reminds me of my Boom Supersonic investment -- the largest personal check I've ever written. Hardware, not software. Long timelines. Massive capital requirements. Regulatory gauntlets. Everything my software-hacker instincts tell me to avoid. But when the ambition is frighteningly large and the team has genuine domain credibility, those instincts can be wrong. Football-field-sized solar arrays that grow in orbit is a frighteningly ambitious idea. If SpaceX's million-satellite constellation, or Starcloud's 88,000 orbital datacenters, or Google's Project Suncatcher materialize at even a fraction of projected scale, whoever can deliver rigid, deployable, high-power solar arrays at that size wins an enormous market. And Redwire's roll-out blanket architecture -- the incumbent solution -- fundamentally cannot maintain structural rigidity at the scales these applications demand. That's the innovator's dilemma playing out in orbit.

The bear case is real: orbital datacenters don't exist yet, the demand projections assume multiple mega-constellations materializing on schedule, and a two-person team will need substantial capital to reach production. Hardware companies die in the valley between prototype and revenue. But the structural dynamics favor them. Patent-pending technology rooted in multi-year PhD research. Switching costs once a satellite bus is designed around their form factor. Flight heritage as a qualification barrier. And a co-founder relationship that predates the company by over a decade. The question isn't whether the problem is real -- every space engineer will tell you it is. The question is whether the orbital datacenter wave arrives on a timeline that sustains this company through its capital-intensive qualification phase. If it does, the moat is deep and the competition is structurally disadvantaged.

What I can't see yet is the specific moment of creative adversity -- the cereal box equivalent. The founders' backgrounds radiate competence and domain depth, but I haven't witnessed them improvise their way out of a corner. That's expected at pre-seed. The evidence of determination is there in the career choices: you don't spend seven years at SpaceX or pursue a PhD in deployable space structures unless you're built for long slogs. Whether they're resourceful enough to navigate the fundraising gauntlet that hardware companies face -- the multiple rounds of capital required before a single array generates revenue -- remains to be demonstrated. I'd want to hear them describe their plan for surviving the qualification valley, not just their plan for the technology.
