# Pollinate -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Two pivots in under two years tells you a lot. Pollinate started as a hospitality app connecting partygoers with nightclubs, then became a food wholesale supply chain tool, and now positions itself as AI agents for hard tech manufacturing ERP automation. I understand that finding product-market fit is iterative -- I ran the Wizard of Oz model at Fin for years before the automation worked. But there's a difference between iterating within a domain you understand deeply and hopping between completely unrelated markets because the last one didn't stick. These founders went from nightclubs to vegetables to circuit board procurement in eighteen months. That's not convergence toward insight -- that's searching for a wave to ride, and "AI agents for supply chain" is the most crowded wave in enterprise software right now.

My framework starts with the founder-idea pairing, and here both components are weak. The "sane" part requires that the founder's specific background lends credibility to this particular problem. Adeep Mitra and Corey Berther are clearly hustlers -- spending their life savings at 18 to fly across Australia and talk to customers shows real grit, and running agencies to five-figure monthly revenue demonstrates they can sell. But neither has enterprise software experience, deep supply chain domain expertise, or a prior exit. Their supply chain exposure comes from shadowing manufacturers during a pivot phase and delivering wholesale vegetables. Compare that to, say, the Mysten Labs team that came out of Meta's crypto infrastructure division -- people who built the exact thing they were now starting a company around. These are energetic young founders looking for a problem, not domain experts who've lived inside one. And the idea itself -- "AI-powered ERP automation" -- is about as consensus as it gets in 2026. Ovlo is in their same YC batch doing the same thing. Levelpath has $100M+ and Battery Ventures behind it. Basware has been doing AP automation for forty years with 6,500 customers. When I described my instant-pass pattern -- an "AI-powered" version of an existing workflow that every incumbent will copy in six months -- this is almost a textbook illustration.

The structural moat question is where this really falls apart for me. I keep saying software is a business tool, not a business model, and Pollinate is pure software with AI as the entire value proposition. My "cherry on top" test asks: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. Without LLMs doing document extraction and matching, Pollinate is just a systems integrator doing manual data reconciliation -- there is no business. That's the exact inverse of what I look for. Craftwork would still be a painting company without AI; it just dispatches crews less efficiently. Pollinate without AI is nothing. Meanwhile, SAP and Oracle are aggressively building AI capabilities directly into their ERP platforms. When SAP ships native three-way match automation -- and they will, because this is an obvious feature, not a novel primitive -- what's left? The company claims an "ontology layer" across ERPs, but there's zero evidence anyone else is building on this ontology or that it constitutes a genuine standard. It reads like a marketing term for their internal data model. The 80/20 model -- 80% platform, 20% bespoke customization per customer -- actually reveals the problem: this is consulting wearing a software costume. Each new ERP integration is a meaningful engineering investment for a two-person team, and each customer needs custom workflow configuration. That's linear, not compounding.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the ERP integration layer becomes genuinely sticky infrastructure -- that once Pollinate connects to a manufacturer's heterogeneous ERP environment and builds workflow-specific agents, the switching cost is so high that customers never leave, even when SAP ships something comparable. You'd need to believe the ontology really does become a cross-ERP data standard that other tools integrate with, creating network effects. And you'd need to believe that two University of Queensland dropouts with no enterprise sales experience will somehow win deals against Levelpath's $100M war chest and Basware's forty-year customer relationships in a market where enterprise procurement buyers are famously conservative. For all of that to be true, the founders would need to be dramatically underestimated -- the kind of diamond-in-the-rough that the Teamshares team represented when they proposed buying hundreds of small businesses through employee ownership. But the Teamshares founders had deep operational credibility in their specific domain. Here, the domain credibility gap is the binding constraint.

The narrative has some theoretical elasticity -- "AI agents for supply chain" can expand from invoice matching to vendor management to demand forecasting to full procurement orchestration. Supply chain is a genuinely large market with real pain. But the execution model caps the ceiling: each new ERP system, each new workflow type, each new manufacturing vertical requires incremental engineering. This isn't a protocol that other applications build on. It's an application that needs to be customized for each deployment. That's not an infinity story -- it's a linear services story dressed up in agent terminology. The first paying customer since June 2025 and $100K+ in purchasing volume processed provide a tiny signal that something works, but this is purchasing volume flowing through the platform, not revenue, and it tells me almost nothing about whether the business compounds.

I'm passing. The fundamental issue isn't the founders' energy or the market's size -- it's that this company sits squarely in the category I've been publicly warning about for two years. AI is the product, not the amplifier. The moat is software, not operations. The idea is consensus, not contrarian. And the founders, while scrappy, haven't yet earned the domain credibility that would make me override those structural concerns. I'd rather back someone building physical supply chain infrastructure with a tech layer than a tech layer searching for supply chain infrastructure to attach to.
