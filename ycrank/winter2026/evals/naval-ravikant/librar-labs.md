# Librar Labs -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The founder trajectory is the first thing I notice, and it's the thing that most concerns me. Jonathan Görtz appears to be around 20 years old based on his education timeline, with two prior ventures -- Cyberboost and Gymbro AI -- each lasting under a year. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson built a youth jobs platform to 40K members, which demonstrates execution capacity. But the pattern across the founding team is serial founding across unrelated domains: cybersecurity, fitness AI, a social media agency, a jobs platform, and now library management. This is precisely the pattern I filter against -- founders whose passion is for the act of founding rather than for the specific problem. When someone jumps from fitness AI to library tech within the same year, I have to ask: what do they know about libraries that can't be taught? One co-founder worked as a librarian. That's exposure, not specific knowledge. Millions of people have shelved books and run circulation desks. The insight that "libraries need better software" is available to anyone who spends a week observing the workflow.

The about page claims "AI-researchers" on the team, but I can't find a single public indicator of ML research -- no published papers, no GitHub repositories, no named credentials in computer vision or machine learning. In the technology business, I need a technologist on the founding team whose work I can evaluate. If the core product differentiator is a computer vision model that recognizes book spines from photographs, I want to see who built it and what their technical depth looks like. The absence of any visible technical signal on a team of four, in a company whose entire differentiation rests on AI, is a structural gap that makes me uncomfortable. You can't outsource the core competency and call it a technology company.

The leverage architecture here follows a pattern I consistently pass on: vertical SaaS that takes an existing software category and modernizes it with AI for a specific industry. Librar is "Follett Destiny but mobile-first with computer vision." The computer vision feature is genuinely useful -- it reduces cataloging time -- but it's an efficiency improvement within an existing workflow, not a new form of leverage that creates a qualitatively new capability. Compare this to what Notion did for individual productivity: it didn't make existing tools faster, it created an entirely new category where one person could do what previously required five separate applications. Librar makes librarians faster. That's valuable, but it's not leverage creation. The "no librarian needed" angle is more interesting -- enabling schools that couldn't afford a librarian to run a library is closer to genuine leverage creation -- but the evidence of this working at scale is limited to Swedish private schools, a very small and homogeneous market segment.

To engage seriously with the bull case: 300 schools in three months and 60% penetration of a market segment is remarkable execution at any stage. If the team can translate Swedish traction into U.S. school district sales, the greenfield opportunity is enormous -- Follett is a PE-owned incumbent with no incentive to cannibalize its own barcode-scanning workflow with AI. The vision of an "intelligence layer for the physical world" using libraries as a wedge is ambitious in the right way. If book spine recognition generalizes to product shelf recognition, warehouse inventory, or retail analytics, the TAM expands by orders of magnitude. And the data moat from scanning hundreds of thousands of bookshelves across diverse lighting conditions, languages, and spine formats could become genuinely defensible over time. This is the version of the story where Librar is the picks-and-shovels play for physical space intelligence, and libraries are just the entry point. For this to work, I'd need to see: (1) a technical founder with demonstrable CV/ML depth, (2) evidence that the vision model generalizes beyond book spines, and (3) a U.S. district sale that proves the product can penetrate institutional procurement. None of these are present today.

The contrarian positioning is weak. This isn't a bet where smart people think you're wrong -- it's a bet where smart people don't think about it at all. Library management software is a niche that most investors ignore because the market appears small, not because they've evaluated it and concluded it won't work. That's not the same as contrarian timing. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was actively illegal and regulators were trying to shut it down. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, economists were publishing papers explaining why it was worthless. Librar faces indifference, not opposition. Indifference can be fine for building a steady business, but it doesn't produce the asymmetric upside I look for -- the 1000x return that comes from being right when the consensus was actively wrong.

The compounding potential is modest but real. Each school that scans its shelves adds training data that improves the CV model for the next school -- that's a genuine flywheel. Switching costs accumulate as circulation history and catalog data build up in the platform. But the domain is narrow enough that a general-purpose vision model from Google or OpenAI could reach comparable accuracy on book spines within a product cycle or two, eroding the technical moat. The lasting defensibility would have to come from the integrated system -- catalog, circulation, patron management, reporting -- not from the CV feature alone. And integrated library systems are well-understood software with no fundamental technical barriers to replication.

I'd pass. The team ships fast and the product addresses a real pain point, but I don't see the specific knowledge, the leverage architecture, or the contrarian timing that would make this a bet with asymmetric upside. This is a competent team building a better version of an existing category for an underserved market -- which can make a fine business but doesn't fit the profile of an investment where nine fail and the tenth returns 1000x.
