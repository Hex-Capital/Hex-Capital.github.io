# Corvera -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Corvera: this is the kind of company that every investor in San Francisco wants to fund right now. "Agentic OS for CPG brands" -- that phrase could have been algorithmically generated from the top of the 2026 VC trend chart. AI agents, vertical SaaS, supply chain automation -- these aren't unpopular ideas. They aren't difficult to assess. They aren't the kind of thing that makes other investors uncomfortable. And that's precisely why I struggle to find my signal here. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX when private rockets were a punchline, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares was absurd, Contraline when male contraception made VCs squirm -- they all shared a quality of making smart people in the room say "that's crazy." Nobody is saying that about Corvera. They're saying "that makes sense," and in my experience, "makes sense" at the pre-seed stage is often a trap.

Christopher Kong's story has elements I respect. He ran Better Nature, a tempeh brand, through nationwide UK retail distribution -- Tesco, Asda, Ocado, Whole Foods. He lived inside the CPG operational grind. He processed the orders, managed the inventory, dealt with the retailer buyer formats. When I ask "how did you get here?" I imagine he'd tell me about the nights spent parsing PDFs and matching catalogs manually, watching his team drown in repetitive work that should have been automated. That's genuine founder-market fit, and it's real. But when I'm evaluating biographical grit -- the kind of adversity that forges a founder's commitment so deeply that they'll survive the inevitable crises -- I'm listening for something more existential. Oxford biochemistry to Forbes 30 Under 30 to YC is an impressive trajectory, but it's not a survival story. His co-founders come from Wharton, Princeton, Google, and Eton College. This is an elite team with elite credentials building something the market already wants. It's a well-constructed professional bet, not a biographical inevitability.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If I imagine the world where Corvera wins big, it looks like this: Kong's intimate knowledge of CPG workflows gives them a six-to-twelve-month head start on integration depth. They build the definitive data flywheel across mid-market brands -- cross-brand demand forecasting, category-specific seasonality patterns, retailer-specific order format parsing -- and that accumulated operational intelligence becomes genuinely hard to replicate. The 15 design partners convert to paying customers, the 50+ brand pipeline fills, and by the time Cin7 or Settle tries to bolt on AI agent capabilities, Corvera has become the default operating system for brands between $5M and $100M in revenue. The vertical specialization creates switching costs that horizontal tools can't overcome. In that scenario, this is a multi-billion dollar outcome. And the timing is arguably right -- LLM inference costs just crossed the threshold where autonomous document processing is economically viable for mid-market companies. The $2M pre-seed with Firstminute Capital and the Deel co-founder as an angel suggests smart money sees the same opportunity.

But I keep returning to what's missing from my framework. Where is the economic access dimension? Corvera serves CPG brands already doing $5M or more in revenue. It makes successful companies more efficient -- a real value proposition, but not one that creates new economic opportunity for people who currently lack it. When I backed Uber, I saw a tool that was going to create income for millions of drivers. When I backed Affirm, I saw transparent credit access replacing predatory hidden fees. When I backed Flock Safety, I saw public safety data being democratized. I don't see that thread here. This is operational optimization for mid-market businesses, which is the kind of thing that generates solid returns for investors but doesn't carry the meaning I look for in my best investments. It doesn't make an invisible system visible to people who need it.

The commoditization risk also concerns me in a way that's specific to how I think about defensibility. The underlying capabilities -- LLM-based document parsing, time-series forecasting, workflow automation -- are getting cheaper and more accessible every quarter. Any well-funded competitor could stand up a similar vertical agent for CPG operations within months. The moat has to come from integration depth and accumulated data, but those take years to build, and this team is starting from UK retail workflows that may not transfer directly to the US market. The brand confusion between "Corvera" and the legal entity "Sarah AI Inc." is a minor signal, but it makes me wonder about the trajectory -- was there a pivot? A rename? These are questions I'd want to explore before writing a check. The co-founder dynamics are also opaque: four people from four different institutions with no shared prior working history. I don't see red flags, but I don't see the stress-tested relationship that gives me confidence they'll navigate the first real crisis together.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a hot market. For plenty of investors, that's more than enough. But I've learned that the deals where the consensus is already formed -- where the category is popular, the credentials are impeccable, and the thesis is easy to articulate -- those aren't where my best returns come from. My best returns come from the weird ones, the ones that make people uncomfortable, the ones where the founder's life story and the company's mission are so entangled you can't separate them. Corvera doesn't give me that feeling. I wish them well, but this isn't my kind of bet.
