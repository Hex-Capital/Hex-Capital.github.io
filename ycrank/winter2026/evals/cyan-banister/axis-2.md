# Axis -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Axis is that "AI for commodity traders" is about as far from unpopular as you can get right now. Everyone and their uncle is building AI tools for financial markets. Kpler has raised $441 million and is doing $100M in ARR. Vortexa just closed a Series C backed by Morgan Stanley. Kayrros doubled its revenue in a single year. There's even another YC W26 company — CommodityAI — working in the same neighborhood. When I look at a deal, the question I'm always asking myself is: does this make me uncomfortable? Does this make other investors squint and back away? "Custom AI models for commodities monitoring" doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. It makes VCs nod and say "interesting space." That's the consensus signal, and it's one of the clearest I've seen. The deals I've done best on — SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline — were the ones where people told me I was out of my mind.

When I sit down with founders, before anything about the product or the market, I want to hear the story of how they got here. Not the pitch — the life. What I can piece together about Ian and Eric is that they're smart, young, and academically credentialed: Yale, UChicago math, a quant trading internship at TransMarket Group. Eric has some exposure to the trading world through that internship, which gives him a foothold of credibility. But I'm not hearing the biographical thread that tells me this person couldn't NOT build this company. Nobody here spent a decade on a commodity trading desk watching the system break. Nobody grew up in an oil-producing region watching value get extracted without transparency. "Interested in trading" is a description of a hobby, not a founding story. I need to feel that the founder and the problem are inseparable — that this person's specific life created the insight and the obsession. I don't feel it here.

The one signal that genuinely landed with me is that Ian and Eric have known each other since pre-school. After what happened with HQ Trivia — a company that had perfect timing, a transformative product, and still died because two co-founders couldn't resolve their conflicts — I pay close attention to the depth of co-founder relationships. A friendship that goes back to age four or five has been stress-tested by decades of growing up together, through adolescence, through different colleges, and now into building a company. That's resilient fabric. It doesn't guarantee anything, but it gives me real comfort that they can fight and repair, which is what startups demand. This is the strongest signal in the entire dossier, and I want to name that clearly.

Let me give the bull case its due, because the space itself has legitimate structural properties. Commodities markets are one of the most opaque ecosystems on earth — trillions of dollars moving through systems that most people can't see, powered by fragmented data stitched together with spreadsheets and phone calls. There's a version of this that rhymes with what Carta did for cap tables or what Affirm did for credit terms: taking an invisible system and making it legible. If Axis could build a model-deployment layer that sits above the data providers and becomes the analytical substrate that traders configure their entire monitoring around, the switching costs could become formidable. The structural argument — that incumbents like Argus Media can't cannibalize their benchmark-reporting business model to become a model-deployment platform — has some merit. And the declining cost of inference makes 2025-2026 a plausible moment for this category to open up. But even in this bull case, the product serves the most well-resourced institutions in global commerce. Vitol, Trafigura, Glencore — these aren't people who lack access to capital or information. I invest in companies that create economic opportunity where it didn't exist before: Uber for drivers, Postmates for delivery workers, Thumbtack for tradespeople. A tool that makes already-powerful commodity traders marginally more efficient doesn't generate the kind of real-world impact that gets me out of bed.

I keep coming back to the absence of biographical weight. Two recently graduated founders with thin domain experience, building in a consensus AI category, targeting the most well-capitalized buyers in global markets, facing competitors with hundreds of millions in funding and established data pipelines. There's no defensibility signal yet, no evidence of traction or customer conversations, and a website that returns only a page title. The pre-school friendship is real and meaningful, and I genuinely respect the ambition of going after a market this large — but ambition alone isn't what separates my best investments from the rest. What separates them is the feeling that this specific human being was forged by life to solve this specific problem, and that the idea itself is strange enough that most investors can't see it yet. Neither of those conditions is present here.
