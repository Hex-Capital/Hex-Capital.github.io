# Librar Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

I've never invested in an EdTech company, and this is an EdTech company wearing a computer vision costume. The structural problem is the same one I've flagged for years: the person who benefits from the product isn't the person who pays for it. Students benefit from better library access. Schools — institutions with thin budgets, long procurement cycles, and committee-driven purchasing — are the buyers. When the company points to the stat that 98% of schools worldwide lack a library management system, most investors hear "greenfield opportunity." I hear "98% of schools have decided this isn't worth paying for." That's not an untapped market. That's a market signal.

The "why now" question is where this falls apart for me. What changed in the last 12-24 months to make school library management software suddenly viable? Computer vision capable of reading text from photographs has been commercially available since 2018-2019. Smartphone cameras crossed the quality threshold for this use case years ago. The dossier's inferred "why now" — advances in foundation models and transfer learning over 2023-2025 — is a stretch. OCR on book spines is a solved problem at the model layer. This isn't analogous to Harvey building ahead of a GPT-4 capability curve. There's no step-function improvement in the underlying technology that unlocks a new market. The founders built a solid product, but the timing thesis is "we decided to build it now," not "the technology just crossed a threshold that makes this possible."

The traction deserves honest acknowledgment. 300 schools globally and 60% penetration of Swedish single-site private schools in three months is real execution. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson scaling Ungdomsförmedlingen to 40,000+ members shows he knows how to build adoption. They shipped a working product, got institutional buyers to adopt it, and moved fast. If I were evaluating execution velocity in isolation, this team would score well. But execution speed in a constrained market doesn't change the market's structure. I've watched talented founders move quickly into markets that couldn't support venture-scale outcomes — the speed makes the collision with the ceiling happen faster, not later.

The bull case would require believing three things simultaneously. First, that the "intelligence layer for the physical world" vision is real and near-term — that library shelf scanning is a wedge into retail inventory, warehouse management, or some broader physical cataloging market worth tens of billions. Second, that the school customer base creates meaningful distribution leverage for that expansion (it doesn't — schools and retailers have entirely different procurement, pricing, and usage patterns). Third, that the computer vision capability built on book spines transfers cleanly to other physical objects at commercial accuracy. If all three were true, this could be a category-defining infrastructure company. But that's three sequential miracles: dominate school libraries, transfer the technology to commercial verticals, and build enterprise distribution from scratch in those new markets. I explicitly reject multi-miracle plans because compounding low-probability events makes failure the overwhelmingly likely outcome.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is the other dimension where this struggles. Stripe started with a payment API and distributed Atlas, Billing, and Treasury through the same developer relationship. Gusto started with payroll and expanded into HR, benefits, and compliance for the same small business customer. In both cases, the initial product created a customer relationship where additional products were natural extensions. What does Librar distribute through a school library system? Reading programs? Book ordering? These are incremental, low-ACV additions within the same budget-constrained buyer. The product doesn't become a channel — it stays a tool. A useful tool, but one with a structural ceiling on revenue per customer and total addressable spend.

The founding team is young — the CEO appears to be around 20-21 based on his education timeline, and prior ventures were each under a year with no exits. Youth isn't disqualifying — I've backed young founders before. But combined with a market that has broken payment structures, a weak timing thesis, and a single-vertical product without a clear platform trajectory, the overall picture doesn't match my investment criteria. This is a competent team building a genuinely useful product in a market I systematically avoid.
