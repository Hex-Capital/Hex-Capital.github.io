# Cajal -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is where this idea came from. Both founders went through Entrepreneurs First -- a program whose entire purpose is to match strangers together and help them brainstorm startup ideas. Pedro Nobre's previous project at EF was Aptia, an AI platform for designing aptamers for early disease detection. Now he's building autonomous mathematical proof discovery in Lean. That's not a pivot; that's a different universe. When I see a founder jump from cancer biomarkers to theorem proving in the span of months, I don't think "versatile." I think "searching." The question I always ask first -- how did they find this problem? -- has an answer here that worries me: they probably found it by looking at what's hot. Harmonic raised $120M at a $1.45B valuation. AlphaProof won an IMO silver medal. The AI-for-math category is on the cover of every tech publication. And two smart people at a startup factory looked at this and said "let's do that, but for applied science." That's the startup idea machine running, not organic discovery.

The name itself tells the story. Cajal -- Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience. That maps to Luke Johnston's ML/neuroscience background at Oxford, Cambridge, and UCL. It's a nice name. But it suggests the company's identity is anchored in a founder's prior research field, not in years of frustration with formal verification. Drew Houston named his company Dropbox because he kept dropping files. The Collisons named theirs Stripe because they were building payment rails. When the company name references the founder's academic lineage rather than the problem being solved, that's a subtle signal about what's driving the venture.

Now, I want to be fair about what's genuinely interesting here. Formal verification for applied scientific domains -- quantum computing, finance, aerospace -- is a real schlep. The kind of tedious, regulatory, mathematically dense work that causes most AI teams to stay in the comfortable lane of competition math benchmarks. Harmonic is chasing IMO gold medals. Axiom is building general mathematical reasoning. Nobody is doing the unglamorous work of formalizing domain-specific applied mathematics and building verification infrastructure for enterprises that actually need correctness guarantees. If Cajal is genuinely pursuing this -- productizing formal verification for quantum computing labs and quant funds rather than publishing papers about competition problems -- there's a real gap. The schlep of dealing with domain-specific formalization libraries, enterprise sales cycles in quantum computing, and regulatory requirements in finance is exactly the kind of thing smart people unconsciously avoid. So the problem passes my schlep test. The question is whether the founders found it through the front door or the back door.

The strongest bull case is that Luke Johnston's research across Oxford, Cambridge, and UCL involved enough mathematical rigor that he hit the wall of informal reasoning personally -- that somewhere in neuroscience modeling he experienced the pain of simulation-based verification and thought "there has to be a way to make this provable." If that's the real story, this becomes more interesting. But I can't find evidence for it. No publications in formal methods. No Lean contributions. No open-source theorem proving work from either founder. Pedro's GitHub shows student-level projects -- air quality monitoring, paper plane optimization, vehicle detection. These are the projects of someone learning to code, not someone building formal verification infrastructure. The gap between what this company claims to do (multi-agent systems discovering novel mathematical proofs in Lean) and what the founders have demonstrably built before is enormous.

The competitive landscape makes this harder, not easier. Harmonic has raised $295M and has actual mathematics PhDs building Lean4 provers. Axiom has $164M and Stanford math expertise. DeepSeek is releasing open-source Lean4 prover models. LeanDojo provides free academic tooling. When I look at Stripe's competitive landscape in 2010, it was mostly banks and old payment companies -- slow-moving incumbents who couldn't build great software. Here, the competitors are well-funded AI labs with deep domain expertise moving fast. And the core infrastructure (Lean) is open-source. Cajal's differentiation -- applied scientific domains rather than competition math -- is a positioning choice, not a technical moat. If Harmonic decides tomorrow that quantum computing verification is interesting, they have 500x the capital and actual formal methods researchers.

I keep coming back to the co-founder question. They met at Entrepreneurs First. That's literally my canonical red flag -- co-founders who met recently specifically to start a company. I've reported that in one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they didn't know between interview and start, and all nine fell apart within a year. EF is a slightly better version of this because the program gives time to build the relationship, but the fundamental dynamic is the same: the company preceded the partnership rather than the partnership producing the company. Combined with zero public traction, no formal methods background, and a hot category crowded with well-funded competitors, I don't see the signals I need.
