# Stilta -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first thing I'd flag. When I mapped AI market clarity last year, I specifically tracked which verticals had crystallized winners and which remained open. Patent AI is no longer an open field. Solve Intelligence has $55M raised, is profitable, and reports 8-figure ARR. DeepIP hit 7-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics grew ARR 20x in six months with $21M in capital. These aren't paper competitors -- they're scaling businesses with 12-18 months of head start and 10-50x the funding. When I invested in Harvey, legal AI broadly was still a science project that most investors dismissed. Patent AI in early 2026 is the opposite: it's a consensus market with validated economics and multiple funded entrants racing to consolidate. That's a fundamentally different competitive posture for a pre-seed company entering with $500K.

The structural moment question -- what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now -- has an answer, but it's the same answer every patent AI company gives: LLMs crossed the fidelity threshold for legal-grade analysis. That's true, but it's not proprietary insight. Solve Intelligence saw it. DeepIP saw it. Patlytics saw it. When the "why now" is generic, there's no asymmetric information advantage for a late entrant. The patent analytics market at $1B growing to $3.4B is real, but it's well-understood and well-capitalized. This is not PagerDuty in 2009, where operations alerting seemed too boring for anyone to fund. This is a market where Series A and Series B rounds have already closed, growth rates are being measured in multiples, and the adoption curve is visible to everyone.

The bull case centers on Stilta's "end-to-end workspace" positioning. The competitors are specialized: Solve Intelligence focuses on drafting and prosecution, DeepIP embeds in Microsoft Word for drafting, Patlytics does analytics and intelligence. Stilta frames itself as the integrated workspace spanning FTO analysis, monitoring, and strategy -- the "Cursor for patent attorneys" framing. If patent practitioners genuinely want workflow consolidation over best-of-breed point solutions, that's a real differentiation vector. The analogy to Cursor is instructive: Cursor won by being the environment developers live in, not by being the best at any single task. For this to work for Stilta, two things would need to be true. First, that patent attorneys experience enough friction switching between tools that consolidation creates genuine pull. Second, that a 4-person team can build depth across multiple workflows simultaneously while competitors with 10-50x the resources go deep on one. That second condition is the harder one -- breadth vs. depth with four engineers against this competitive field requires either extraordinary execution velocity or a fundamentally different architectural approach. I don't see evidence of either yet.

The team's domain fit concerns me more than their technical capability. McKinsey/QuantumBlack backgrounds mean they know enterprise AI deployment. Oskar Block bootstrapping two ventures to $1M+ ARR demonstrates operational scrappiness -- that's a real signal at pre-seed. But none of the four founders have documented experience in patent law, IP prosecution, or legal practice. Patent work is deeply specialized: claim construction, prosecution strategy, jurisdictional nuances, examiner psychology. When I backed Harvey, the team had deep legal workflow understanding. When Color Health worked, it was because we understood the clinical and regulatory landscape from the inside. Here, the team appears to be AI engineers who identified patent work as a promising application domain, not patent practitioners who identified AI as the solution to their workflow pain. The statement that they're "live with leading firms" partially mitigates this -- you can't serve patent attorneys without learning the domain fast -- but the gap between serving customers and having the intuition to build the right abstractions is real.

The product-to-distribution trajectory has theoretical promise but no concrete evidence. If Stilta becomes the workspace patent teams operate in, they could distribute additional IP management capabilities through that integration -- patent portfolio analytics, licensing workflow, competitive intelligence. That's the playbook: a wedge product becomes a distribution channel. But I don't see how they get initial adoption against entrenched competitors who already have customers and product-market fit in their respective niches. The distribution strategy appears to be direct sales to law firms, possibly leveraging McKinsey network connections. That's a reasonable approach, but it's not a structural distribution advantage. Founders who haven't articulated a concrete distribution mechanism beyond "we'll sell to firms" are missing the piece that separates good companies from generational ones.

The technology cycle positioning is correct but undifferentiated. Agentic AI frameworks enabling multi-step reasoning and tool use in 2024-2025 do enable a qualitatively different product than what was possible with earlier models. But this infrastructure is available to every competitor, and the earlier entrants have already been iterating on these capabilities with live customers generating feedback loops. Being right about the technology cycle matters, but being right at the same time as four well-funded competitors doesn't create the asymmetric position I look for.
