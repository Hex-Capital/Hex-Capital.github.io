# shortkit -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Michael Seleman spent six years building the infrastructure behind YouTube Shorts. That's the kind of credential that makes you sit up. It's rare to see a founder who has literally built the thing they're now trying to sell — not as a side project, not as a consultant, but as a core engineer at the company operating at the largest scale in the world. When I hear "six years building YouTube Shorts infrastructure," I know the founder understands adaptive bitrate transcoding, feed ranking, global delivery, and all the ugly engineering details that make short-form video work. He didn't read about this problem. He lived inside it.

But here's what I keep coming back to: there's a difference between knowing how hard something is to build and knowing that other people desperately need it built. Seleman's organic discovery is about the technical challenge — he knows from firsthand experience that short-form video infrastructure is enormously complex. That's one half of the equation. The other half is whether enough consumer app teams are actually struggling with this problem right now, today, and would pay to make it go away. That second part looks more like a market thesis than a lived experience. When Drew Houston built Dropbox, he wasn't just aware that file sync was technically hard — he personally kept forgetting his USB drive. The pain was his own. With ShortKit, the pain Seleman experienced was building this at YouTube. The customers' pain — consumer app teams trying to embed TikTok-style feeds — is inferred, not witnessed. I'd want to hear Seleman describe specific conversations with engineering teams who were drowning in this problem. Without that, I worry the idea was "I know how to build this, so someone must want to buy it," which is the expert's version of a manufactured idea.

The schlep here is real but it's the wrong kind of hard. It's purely technical complexity — video transcoding, CDN delivery, mobile SDKs. That's the kind of schlep that talented engineers can power through, which means it doesn't structurally deter competition the way regulatory, logistical, or trust-based schleps do. Stripe's moat wasn't just technical — it was dealing with banks, compliance, fraud, and the financial system's bureaucracy. ShortKit's individual components are commoditized: HLS transcoding is a solved problem, CDN delivery is commodity infrastructure, video player SDKs exist everywhere. The vertical integration for the short-form feed pattern is the differentiation, but a company like Mux — which already has $46 million in revenue and 4,900 customers — could build this as a product extension if the market proves real. Technical schlep without structural schlep creates a window, not a wall.

The co-founder pairing concerns me. No shared university, no shared employer, no visible prior connection between Michael Seleman (Tufts, YouTube) and Neil Bhammar (Northeastern, BusRight). I've seen this pattern enough times to be wary. In one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they hadn't known long, and all nine fell apart within a year. I'm not saying that's what happened here — but the absence of any visible relationship history is exactly the pattern that triggers my concern. Neil brings operational experience from scaling BusRight, which is valuable, but he's not technical. That means the entire technical differentiator of the company — the thing that makes ShortKit more than just another video API wrapper — lives in one person's head. For a developer tools company, that's a concentrated risk.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. If "every app wants to be TikTok" is even half true, the demand for embeddable short-form video infrastructure could be massive. Mux proved that developer video infrastructure is a real and growing market. ShortKit is betting that short-form feeds are different enough from general video to warrant a specialized product — and given TikTok's cultural dominance, that bet isn't crazy. The zero-dependency native iOS SDK built on Foundation, UIKit, and AVFoundation shows genuine technical craft, not just duct-taping APIs together. If Seleman can demonstrate that enterprise app teams are spending six months and three engineers trying to build what ShortKit provides out of the box, this becomes a much more compelling story. The timing — every media company, fitness app, and e-commerce platform wanting vertical video feeds simultaneously — could create a real wave. But I need to see evidence of that demand, not just the logic of it.

Right now, there's zero public evidence of user pull. No customers, no revenue, no waitlist, no community. At pre-seed that's not damning by itself, but combined with the enterprise sales motion (Calendly-based technical walkthroughs, no self-serve), it means I can't distinguish between "developers are pulling this product toward them" and "the founders are pushing a product at a market that may not exist at sufficient scale." The iOS-only limitation further narrows the addressable market at launch. ShortKit is a bet on a single founder's domain expertise in a market whose size is unproven. I respect the expertise. I need more signal on the demand.
