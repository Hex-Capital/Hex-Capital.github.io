# Booko -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The structural question I keep returning to with Booko is whether dynamic pricing for appointment slots is a company or a feature. Mindbody already does this through ClassPass. Vagaro just acquired Schedulicity, signaling it wants to own the full stack. Acuity sits inside Squarespace. The booking platforms that Booko depends on for API access are the same companies most incentivized to build exactly what Booko builds. This is the canonical "integration layer on someone else's platform" risk -- you're one API deprecation or one product update away from obsolescence. The Mindbody channel-conflict argument is the strongest counterpoint: their marketplace model takes 20% commissions, so offering a pure B2B pricing tool would cannibalize their own revenue. That's a real structural wedge. But structural wedges are temporary. The moment Booko proves the model works, the incentive for incumbents to internalize it increases, not decreases.

On specific knowledge: Arjun Saluja built dynamic pricing systems at Joby Aviation, which is genuine hands-on work with demand prediction and price optimization algorithms. That's more than academic. But Joby is pricing eVTOL aircraft seats -- a fundamentally different demand surface than hair salon appointments at 2pm on a Tuesday. The transferable piece is the ML methodology, and ML pricing methodology is increasingly textbook knowledge. Will Hall ran a digital marketing agency, which gives him small-business customer empathy but not the kind of deep, non-transferable insight into how service businesses actually make pricing decisions under uncertainty. Neither founder has operated a fitness studio, worked at a booking platform, or spent years inside the problem they're solving. The observation that "time slots are perishable inventory" is available to anyone who's read a revenue management paper. I backed Evan Williams at Twitter because he'd spent a decade understanding public communication in a way no one else had. I don't see that depth of domain obsession here.

The leverage test is where this falls short most clearly. Booko is not creating a new form of leverage that didn't exist before. It's optimizing an existing process -- filling empty appointment slots -- which is valuable but incremental. Compare this to Replit, which gives someone who couldn't code the ability to build software, or to AngelList, which gave founders access to capital markets that were previously closed. Those are new capabilities. Booko gives a salon owner a slightly better discount algorithm. Each customer integration requires engineering work against a specific booking platform's API. There are no network effects -- one salon's pricing data doesn't help another salon in a different city with different demand patterns (or if it does, that's an unproven hypothesis). The scalability is standard SaaS: linear with customer count, not exponential.

The bull case that would make me wrong: if demand prediction for service businesses turns out to be a genuinely hard ML problem where cross-customer data creates non-obvious prediction improvements -- where knowing utilization patterns at 500 yoga studios in 30 cities produces insights no single studio or booking platform could generate -- then the data flywheel becomes real and defensible. If the founders execute fast enough to become the default pricing layer across Mindbody, Vagaro, and Acuity before any of them build it natively, the switching costs (proven uplift metrics, integration depth, optimized models) could be substantial. And if the "15-25% revenue uplift in 2 weeks" claim holds across verticals, the ROI story sells itself. In this scenario, Booko becomes the pricing infrastructure layer for the service economy -- picks and shovels rather than applications. That's a meaningful outcome. But it requires the ML to be genuinely hard, the data flywheel to be real, and the incumbents to stay asleep -- three conditions I can't verify from the available evidence.

The timing isn't contrarian in any meaningful sense. Nobody is arguing against dynamic pricing for services -- ClassPass proved the concept a decade ago. The "B2B overlay versus marketplace" distinction is a go-to-market choice, not a paradigm bet. Smart people aren't dismissing this idea; they're just not thinking about it because it's a narrow optimization problem in a fragmented market. I get paid for being right first, but being right first about something nobody cares about is different from being right first about something everyone's wrong about. There's no consensus to bet against here -- just a market gap that exists because the incumbents' business models create a temporary misalignment. That's an arbitrage opportunity, not a compounding platform.

I respect the founders for getting into YC and building something real. But this is the archetype of what I pass on: competent people applying teachable knowledge to a feature-scale problem without a distinctive leverage mechanism. The technology doesn't compound in a way that creates enduring defensibility, the founders' knowledge could be acquired by any motivated team in six months, and the best outcome is a solid SaaS business -- not the kind of asymmetric upside I optimize for. I'd rather lose money nine times out of ten on bets with 1000x potential than make safe 3x bets on yield-management SaaS.
