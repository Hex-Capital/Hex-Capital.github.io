# Prana -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Prana is the battlefield they're choosing to fight on. Forward Health poured over $600 million into AI-first primary care and shut down in 2024. K Health has $439 million and is embedded with Mayo Clinic and Cedars-Sinai. Ro has crossed a billion in funding with nearly $600 million in annualized revenue. And now three founders who are still finishing their degrees are walking into this arena with $39 doctor visits and a free AI chatbot. I've made bets on founders entering intimidating markets before -- SpaceX looked insane when Elon was going up against Boeing and Lockheed -- but what made those bets work was that the founder had an insight so non-obvious that the incumbents weren't even competing in the same frame. AI-powered primary care is not non-obvious. It is possibly the single most consensus category in health tech right now, with $4 billion in healthcare AI funding deployed in 2025 alone. When every VC in town wants to fund a category, the weirdness has been priced out, and I've learned that's exactly when I should not be writing checks.

What I want to hear from any founder before I look at their product is the story -- not the business plan, but how they arrived at this specific problem in a way that makes them the person who has to solve it. Meer Patel deferred Brown Medical School, and that's a real signal of commitment -- you don't walk away from an MD program lightly. He has genuine technical depth: NIH research, Columbia, biomedical devices that attracted Danaher's backing. Vishvam Rawal built quantitative infrastructure at Weiss and Barclays. Sanjit Menon is finishing his MD and already scaled a health-tech product to 400+ customers. These are impressive credentials assembled into a well-designed skill stack. But credentials and biographical grit are different things. I'm listening for the founder who slept in their car, who watched a parent die from a condition that could have been caught earlier, who built the first prototype in a library because they couldn't afford a computer at home. I'm listening for the story where the founder and the problem are inseparable. What I see here are three talented, well-educated young people who identified a market opportunity and assembled the right team to pursue it. That's a legitimate way to build a company. It's just not the signal that makes me reach for my checkbook.

The bull case is real and I want to be honest about it. Forward's failure was about physical infrastructure -- expensive CarePods in real estate locations -- while Prana is software-first and asset-light. The timing convergence is genuine: LLMs can now do meaningful clinical reasoning, wearable adoption has hit critical mass with Apple Watch and CGMs, and the employer self-insurance channel creates a buyer who is actively motivated to reduce metabolic risk costs. If Prana can demonstrate that their continuous monitoring actually catches clinical drift that reduces downstream healthcare spend, the employer contracts could create a recurring revenue engine that makes the $39 consumer price point a brilliant acquisition funnel rather than an unsustainable loss leader. That's a credible path. But "credible path in a large market with good timing" describes dozens of companies I see every year. It's exactly the kind of thesis that consensus-driven investors fund, and exactly the kind I've trained myself to resist.

I keep coming back to economic access, because that's where I look for the soul of a company. The $39 flat-rate model without insurance does lower a real barrier -- there are tens of millions of Americans who avoid primary care because of cost uncertainty. That matters. But I think about Uber and how it created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers who had no other flexible work option, or Affirm replacing predatory hidden fees with transparent credit. Those companies restructured who participates in the economy. Prana makes existing healthcare more convenient and slightly cheaper for people who already own smartphones and wearables and have the health literacy to engage with an AI doctor. The people most failed by the 15-minute annual physical -- the unhoused, the uninsured in rural areas, people without digital literacy -- are probably not the early adopters of an app-based AI doctor. The access story is there, but it's incremental rather than structural.

The three-founder dynamic gives me pause. I learned from HQ Trivia that even perfect timing and a transformative product cannot survive unresolved founder conflict. Here I see three co-founders from three different universities -- Johns Hopkins, Berkeley, Albany Medical College -- with no publicly identifiable shared history. I don't know how they met, I don't know how they argue, and I don't know who makes the final call when they disagree. A three-way split with no tested conflict resolution and no established hierarchy is something I'd want to probe deeply before getting comfortable. The healthcare space they're entering is going to throw crises at them -- a patient adverse event, a regulatory challenge, a cash crunch when the employer pilot takes longer than expected -- and I need to know this team can weather those together.

I respect the regulatory complexity Prana is taking on. Being a licensed medical provider across all 50 states, managing malpractice coverage, maintaining HIPAA compliance, navigating the untested liability boundary between AI recommendations and physician decisions -- this is genuinely hard, and it does create barriers that pure-tech competitors cannot easily clear. That's the one dimension where this company starts to resemble the kinds of bets I favor: hard spaces where regulatory moats protect the founders who can navigate them. But the moat only works if you survive long enough to build it, and K Health already has the institutional relationships and capital to operate at this intersection of AI and licensed care at scale. The question is whether Prana's DTC-plus-employer approach can outrun incumbents who are coming from the other direction.

This is a pass for me. Not because the founders aren't talented -- they clearly are -- and not because the market isn't real. It's a pass because the most promising companies I've backed were unpopular, difficult to assess, and had founders whose life stories made them the only people who could build that specific thing. Prana is popular, easy to categorize, and built by credentialed young people who assembled the right résumé rather than lived through the problem. I wish them well -- genuinely -- but this isn't where my conviction lives.
