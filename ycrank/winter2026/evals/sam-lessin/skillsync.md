# Skillsync -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that jumps off the page before I even get to the founders: Microsoft owns both LinkedIn and GitHub. Let that sink in. Skillsync is building a developer sourcing tool by analyzing public GitHub contributions and selling it to recruiters who already use LinkedIn. The company with the professional graph AND the code graph AND the distribution to every recruiter on earth is the same company. This isn't a latent competitive threat -- it's a structural death sentence. Microsoft could ship "LinkedIn Recruiter: Code Insights" as a feature toggle and it would reach more recruiters on day one than Skillsync will reach in its lifetime. When I evaluate competitive dynamics, I ask whether the startup has a structural position that incumbents cannot replicate. Here, the incumbent literally owns the data source.

The founders are the one piece that gives me pause. Narayana and Nishant worked together at Juspay building Hyperswitch -- an open-source Rust payments switch that grew to 40K+ GitHub stars. They managed hundreds of open-source contributors, which means they personally experienced the problem of identifying who in an open-source community actually has the skills you need. That's real domain credibility. Nishant's GitHub presence (182 followers, Shelgon with 271 stars, deep Rust expertise) shows he lives in the world Skillsync indexes. These are sane people. But they're pursuing a sane idea, not an insane one. "Use AI to analyze GitHub profiles for recruiting" is exactly the kind of thing that sounds smart and obvious to everyone -- and that's the problem. When the idea is obvious, the market has already priced it in. SeekOut has $189M in funding. HireEZ has $26M. The competitive landscape isn't empty; it's crowded. My framework works when a credible founder is doing something that makes other investors uncomfortable or confused. Nothing about Skillsync makes investors uncomfortable.

Now let me run my AI kill test, and it's devastating here. The dossier itself says the quiet part out loud: "The convergence of large language models capable of understanding code semantics has made automated code analysis at scale technically feasible in a way it was not 2-3 years ago." So the company exists because AI made it possible. Remove AI and the product doesn't work at the quality level needed to be useful. That's the exact inverse of my "cherry on top" framework. I want businesses that would be great without AI, where AI makes them better. Skillsync IS an AI application. And here's the kicker -- the same LLMs that make Skillsync's code analysis possible make it possible for literally everyone else too. GitHub Copilot is already expanding into developer analytics. Any well-funded recruiting platform can plug in the same models against the same public API data. When AI is the moat, AI is not a moat, because everyone has it.

The bull case would require believing that Skillsync can build a proprietary skill-extraction engine so much better than anything else that it becomes the de facto standard for code-based developer profiles -- essentially a new primitive for how engineering skills get represented and queried. If they could get developers to actually claim and enrich their profiles, creating a two-sided network effect, that would change the structural dynamics entirely. The specialized hiring market for systems engineers, robotics developers, and ML-on-edge talent is genuinely underserved, and a $499/month tool that surfaces candidates invisible to LinkedIn-based sourcing could generate real revenue quickly with even a handful of engineering-led companies. But this bull case requires solving the consent problem (developers actively resisting being profiled without opt-in), outrunning Microsoft's inevitable feature launch, and building network effects on a platform where the developer side has no incentive to participate. That's three simultaneous breakthroughs -- too many bets stacked on top of each other.

Structurally, this is a SaaS subscription product ($499/month per seat) where the subscription pricing model is the primary business model. That's a red flag I've written about extensively. The product positioning has already shifted once -- from "discover hidden talent in your codebase" (internal analytics) to "find anyone in open source" (external recruiting) -- with only 3 Product Hunt upvotes to show for the first iteration. That pivot signal tells me they haven't locked onto product-market fit yet. No disclosed revenue, no public user counts, no community engagement beyond YC. The GitHub org has 3 followers and zero public repos. At pre-seed I don't penalize the absence of scale, but I do need at least one signal that this specific approach is resonating with actual buyers, and I don't see it here.

I respect the founders' open-source credentials and their authentic connection to this problem. In a different structural context -- if they were building protocol-layer infrastructure for developer identity that other platforms built on, or if they had a physical-world operational moat that software couldn't replicate -- I'd lean in harder. But what I see is an AI-powered SaaS recruiting tool built on someone else's platform, competing against well-funded incumbents, in a market where the platform owner has every incentive and capability to build the same feature. That's a pass for me.
