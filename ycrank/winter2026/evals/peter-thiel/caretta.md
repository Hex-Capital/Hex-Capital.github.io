# Caretta -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the whole story before I even get to the founders. Gong has raised over $584 million and generates $250 million or more in annual recurring revenue. Cresta has raised $282 million. Balto has raised $52 million. Salesken has $41 million and Microsoft's M12 behind it. These companies are all converging on the same destination: AI that helps salespeople sell better, increasingly in real time. Caretta's claimed differentiation -- real-time assistance during the call rather than post-call analytics -- is not a secret. It is a feature that every incumbent can see, that Gong is already building, and that requires no non-obvious insight to pursue. When I ask "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" and the answer is "help during the call is more valuable than help after the call," I am hearing something that every sales rep on earth already knows. That is not a secret. That is a to-do item on Gong's product roadmap.

The mimetic dynamics here are unmistakable. Five or more funded companies are pursuing variations on the same thesis using the same underlying technology stack. Caretta's public GitHub repository is a FastAPI wrapper around NVIDIA's Parakeet transcription model -- off-the-shelf components assembled competently but without any proprietary technological barrier. Speech-to-text plus retrieval-augmented generation plus large language model inference is a pattern that any competent engineering team can replicate in weeks. The "conversation intelligence" market may reach $49 billion by 2032, but a massive market with no clear monopoly path is not an opportunity -- it is an invitation to wage a war of attrition where margins converge to zero. This is the food delivery dynamic applied to sales software: everyone can see the market, everyone is building the same thing, and the only question is who burns the most capital before the survivors settle for modest returns.

The founding team presents a second concern. Kayra Bahadir, Omar Elamin, and Pavlos Markesinis are TU Delft computer science graduates whose prior experience includes Discord bots scaled to 30,000 users and earthquake relief fundraising. These are not disqualifying facts -- Zuckerberg was a 19-year-old programmer when I wrote the first check -- but what made Zuckerberg extraordinary was not his age or his credentials. It was the specificity and ferocity of his vision. He refused a billion-dollar acquisition at 22 because he knew exactly what Facebook would become. Caretta's founders launched as VoysAI in April 2025 with two different products (recruitment screening and sales practice), then pivoted to live-call intelligence within six to eight months. A pivot that fast signals the iterate-and-search methodology that I consider fundamentally at odds with definite optimism. "Lean is code for unplanned," and a company that has already changed its core thesis once in under a year has not yet found the kind of conviction that sustains a decade-long monopoly-building effort. Moreover, no public evidence suggests any of the three founders have direct experience in B2B sales, revenue operations, or selling to sales leaders -- a domain where credibility and workflow intimacy are prerequisites for adoption.

The strongest bull case requires me to believe three things simultaneously: that real-time in-call assistance is a defensible category rather than a feature that incumbents will absorb; that per-customer knowledge accumulation creates switching costs durable enough to withstand Gong's distribution advantage; and that the timing window created by low-latency LLMs in 2024-2025 gives Caretta enough runway to establish position before well-resourced competitors close the gap. There is a version of this world where the knowledge flywheel -- every call enriching the organizational intelligence layer -- creates genuine lock-in that compounds faster than any incumbent can replicate from a standing start. If Caretta could dominate a specific vertical (say, cybersecurity sales teams who need deep technical knowledge surfaced in real time) and make the product indispensable before Gong's real-time features mature, the switching costs could become meaningful. But this would require a beachhead strategy that I see no evidence of, domain expertise that the team has not demonstrated, and proprietary technology that their public codebase suggests does not exist. The gap between what would need to be true and what is visible is too wide.

I pass. The absence of a genuine secret is dispositive. "Real-time is better than post-call" is not contrarian -- it is the consensus trajectory of an entire category. The technology is commodity. The market is contested by multiple well-funded players pursuing the same thesis. The founders have pivoted once and lack domain expertise in their target market. This is a company entering competition, and competition is for losers.
