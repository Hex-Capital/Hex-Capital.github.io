# DroneTector -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I see when I look at DroneTector is a competitive landscape that tells me almost everything I need to know. Robin Radar generated €43 million in revenue in 2023 and has 200+ radar units deployed in Ukraine right now. DroneShield posted $57.5 million in FY2024 revenue. Dedrone was acquired by Axon to bolt onto their existing defense distribution network. Fortem Technologies has $79 million in funding and just won a contract to protect the 2026 FIFA World Cup. This is not a market waiting for someone to arrive and invent the category. The category exists. The incumbents are scaled. The question DroneTector faces isn't "can we detect drones?" — it's "can we detect drones meaningfully better than four well-funded companies already doing it?" That's an incremental question, and incremental questions make me nervous.

The consequence of success here is a successful defense radar company. If everything works — the 94 GHz technology proves decisive on nano drones, defense procurement cycles cooperate, manufacturing scales — DroneTector becomes one of several companies serving a $10-15 billion market by 2030. That's a real business. But nobody's world changes. Airports already have counter-drone systems. Militaries are already buying drone detection at scale. DroneTector's success adds another option to an existing procurement menu. Compare that to the consequence of fusion energy replacing fossil fuels, or AI replacing 80% of what doctors do, or plant-based protein reclaiming half the planet's arable land. Those are consequences that justify risking total loss. Adding a higher-frequency radar to a crowded detection market is not that kind of consequence.

The strongest bull case deserves genuine engagement, because there's a version of this that's interesting. If nano drones — the $50 units, the ones smaller than a bird — become the dominant weapon system in modern warfare, and if lower-frequency radar physically cannot resolve them, then 94 GHz millimeter-wave becomes not a feature but a structural necessity. The CEO's peer-reviewed research in IET Radar, Sonar & Navigation specifically addresses micro-Doppler signatures at this frequency band. If the physics says Robin Radar's lower-frequency approach fundamentally cannot see the next generation of threats, DroneTector owns the only solution that works. That would be a genuine disruption — making the existing detection infrastructure structurally inadequate. The Ukraine conflict's trajectory suggests the drone threat is escalating toward exactly this smaller, cheaper, more numerous threat profile. The timing could be exceptional: building the right technology just before the market realizes it needs it. If I believed the technological discontinuity was sharp enough — that there's a frequency threshold below which detection of nano drones is impossible — I'd lean in despite the crowded market, because the existing players would all be on the wrong side of a physics wall.

But I don't see evidence that the discontinuity is that sharp. Robin Radar already uses micro-Doppler classification and has deployed operationally against small drones in active conflict. The dossier says DroneTector "claims higher-frequency radar for smaller targets," but the performance gap between 94 GHz and Robin Radar's approach isn't quantified anywhere. This is the KiOR lesson applied differently: technology achievement matters only if it creates economic impact sufficient to displace what exists. If 94 GHz gives you 20% better detection on the smallest drones, that's a feature, not a disruption. If it gives you detection of targets that are invisible to everything else, that's a different company entirely. The dossier doesn't resolve which world we're in.

The team composition concerns me in ways specific to my framework. Three PhDs directly commercializing their academic research is the expert-driven playbook I've learned to be skeptical of. The CEO's PhD was literally "millimeter-wave radar for drone detection" — he's building exactly what his thesis proposed. There's no evidence of the outsider's advantage, no naivety that frees you to attempt what the industry considers impossible, because the industry doesn't consider this impossible. They're already doing it at lower frequencies. Moreover, all three founders are academics with no defense sales, manufacturing, or go-to-market experience on the team. For a hardware company selling into defense procurement — 12-36 month sales cycles, security clearances, compliance — the absence of someone who has navigated that labyrinth is a structural gap. The CTO's apparent dual involvement with Quantum Fabrix on a three-person team adds friction I'd want resolved before writing a check.

The NATO DIANA and DASA participation are meaningful credentialing signals for defense procurement access, and the RAEng Enterprise Fellowships indicate institutional endorsement. These are real assets that shorten the path into UK/NATO buying cycles. But credentialing is not the same as commercial traction — no revenue signal exists, and the most concrete external validation is winning "Best Pitch" and £500 at Converge Challenge. The defense-tech path from accelerator participant to contracted supplier is long and capital-intensive, and the team's current size and funding don't obviously support surviving multiple procurement cycles without revenue.
