# Zatanna -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me almost everything I need to know about the structural moment. Trust AI has 8,000 dentists on an AI-native practice management system with $6.5M in funding. DentalRobot has been training on dental-specific workflows for five years. Overjet has $133M and a $550M valuation in dental AI. Pearl has $58M and 150,000 practitioners using its platform. When I see a pre-seed company entering a vertical where four funded competitors already have distribution, data, or both, the burden of proof shifts dramatically. This isn't an empty field where a fast-moving team can capture the structural moment -- the structural moment has already been recognized and is being contested by teams with meaningful head starts.

The market itself fails my inflection test. Dental RCM services at $748 million growing at 5.25% CAGR is a mature market expanding at roughly GDP rate. Compare this to the markets where my "boring but critical" pattern has actually produced outsized returns: PagerDuty addressed operations alerting for every company running software -- a market that was expanding with cloud adoption at 30%+ annually. Gusto addressed payroll for every employer in America -- universal by definition. Dental billing is boring, yes, but it's also narrow: restricted to ~200,000 US dental practices, with a sub-billion-dollar TAM that's growing slowly. "Boring and small" is not the same as "boring and inevitable." The dossier's "why now" is entirely inferred -- LLMs got better, staffing is harder, the No Surprises Act added compliance burden -- and none of these are specific to dental billing. "LLMs exist" is the same timing thesis I hear from every AI wrapper company. When I evaluated Harvey, the timing thesis was specific: GPT-3 to GPT-4 scaling laws suggested legal-grade fidelity was 12-18 months away, against a $900 billion market built on repetitive high-value tasks. Here, the timing thesis is generic and the market is two orders of magnitude smaller.

The product-to-distribution trajectory concerns me. Can dental billing agents become a distribution channel for additional products? In theory, you could expand to full practice management or from dental to medical billing. But the dossier correctly identifies that dental uses CDT codes while medical uses CPT/ICD-10, with fundamentally different payer dynamics and regulatory requirements. The 30,000-EOB dataset that constitutes Zatanna's claimed differentiator is dental-specific -- it doesn't port to a broader healthcare play without rebuilding the data foundation from scratch. This means the distribution channel, if it works, is capped at the dental vertical for the foreseeable future. Stripe's API was a distribution channel because every internet business needs payments. A dental billing agent is a distribution channel for dental practices only -- a much narrower funnel.

The strongest bull case: dental billing involves genuine, quantifiable pain. Every incorrect EOB, every missed pre-authorization, every underpaid claim directly reduces practice revenue. If Zatanna can demonstrably recover 5-10% of revenue that practices currently leave on the table, the ROI case is immediate and concrete -- dental practices would pay $500-1,000/month happily. The billing-layer approach, integrating with existing PMS tools rather than replacing them, has lower adoption friction than Trust AI's full replacement strategy. And if the EOB dataset compounds with each practice onboarded, the system gets better at predicting claim outcomes, creating a real data moat over time. The wedge strategy is sound in theory: start narrow on the highest-pain workflow (billing and claims), build the practice relationship, then expand. If the team executes this with the kind of velocity that proves they can capture practices before DentalRobot or Trust AI lock them in, there's a path to a meaningful business in dental and potentially beyond.

But the execution evidence isn't here to support that bull case. No public traction -- no revenue signal, no customer count, no prototype usage data. The founders are recent graduates with internship-level experience at tech companies (Coinbase, Amazon, AT&T) and no visible healthcare billing or dental industry experience. The CTO's prior work was at a sports betting analytics platform. I don't see the domain depth that would give me confidence this team can codify the "tribal knowledge" of experienced dental billing staff into software -- that requires deep understanding of insurer-specific claim patterns, CDT coding nuances, and appeal procedures that comes from working inside the problem. When the competitive field includes a team that's been training on dental workflows for five years (DentalRobot) and another with 8,000 dentists already onboarded (Trust AI), the bar for a pre-seed team without domain credentials is very high.

This is a pass. The market is real but small and slow-growing. The timing thesis is generic. The competitive field is already contested by better-capitalized teams with more domain-specific data and distribution. And the founders haven't demonstrated the dental billing expertise that would make me believe they can outlearn competitors who have multi-year head starts. The "boring but critical" pattern from my portfolio works when the boring market is universal and expanding -- dental RCM at $748 million growing at 5% is neither.
