# sitefire -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the category. GEO -- Generative Engine Optimization -- is exactly the kind of idea that gets generated when smart people sit down and ask "what should we build in the AI era?" The dossier lists at least six funded competitors doing variations of the same thing, with Peec AI already at $29M raised and $4M ARR. When I wrote that the most impressive YC companies I've seen recently are not working on AI, this is what I meant. Not that AI companies are bad, but that consensus categories attract the kind of companies that exist because a market was identified, not because a problem was felt. The GEO space is the 2026 equivalent of the recipe sites I warned about in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas" -- technically plausible, market-researchable, and devoid of organic origin.

How did these founders find this problem? Jochen has a PhD in reinforcement learning applied to power grids. Vincent has a CS degree and built robotics software at RobCo and healthcare software at Avi Medical. They co-founded an energy company together. Neither has any documented background in marketing, SEO, or content strategy. The dossier itself flags this: "Neither founder has a documented background in marketing or SEO." When I ask my first question -- did they stumble into this problem through lived experience, or did they sit down and try to think of startup ideas? -- the answer is uncomfortably clear. This looks like two capable technical founders who noticed AI was reshaping search and decided to build a tool for it. The problem is real, but it wasn't theirs. An idea that could have been conceived by anyone reading a trends report carries a different risk profile than one born from years of frustration with a specific broken system.

The schlep test is what really concerns me. Stripe worked because payments involved a genuinely ugly tangle of banking relationships, regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and financial infrastructure -- the kind of problem that made smart engineers look the other way for a decade. What's the schlep in GEO? Querying LLM APIs, analyzing citation patterns, and generating blog posts. This is exactly the kind of work that every competent AI engineer finds interesting, not repulsive. That's why there are so many competitors. When the work involved in solving a problem is fun rather than painful, you don't get the structural competition barrier that schlep blindness creates. You get a crowded field where the advantage goes to whoever has the most capital, and Peec AI already has $29M.

The strongest signal in Sitefire's favor is the enterprise clients: BMW, Xtrackers, and DWS. For a two-person pre-seed team, landing recognizable European brands is real. It suggests the founders can sell, and that at least someone wants what they've built. The content-generation-plus-CMS-delivery loop is also a genuine differentiator -- going from "here's a dashboard" to "here's a ready-to-publish page" is the kind of full-stack approach I generally like. If I'm being honest about what would have to be true for this to work: the GEO market genuinely could be the next SEO market, and the company that closes the loop from analytics to action could own the category the way HubSpot eventually owned inbound marketing. The founders' prior co-founding relationship (pulse Energy) and Vincent's track record of building since age 18 are real positives. If they're learning the marketing domain fast enough and their enterprise clients convert to meaningful revenue, the technical competence is there to iterate quickly.

But "what would have to be true" is doing a lot of work in that paragraph. The founders would need to acquire deep marketing domain expertise they don't yet have, outexecute a competitor with 15x their funding, build defensibility in a space where the monitoring layer is already commoditizing, and do it all while dependent on LLM providers who could change their APIs tomorrow. That's at least three miracles, and I've always said that needing more than one miracle to succeed is a red flag. The technical founders are competent -- Vincent in particular looks like a genuine builder -- but competence aimed at a manufactured problem in a consensus category doesn't match how I invest my own money.
