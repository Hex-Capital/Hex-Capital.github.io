# Balance -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Balance isn't Balance itself -- it's Bench. Bench raised $113 million to do essentially what Balance is proposing: managed bookkeeping for SMBs at a flat rate. Then in December 2024, Bench collapsed, stranding 35,000 customers overnight. Balance is betting that Bench failed because it was too human-heavy, and that AI can fix the unit economics. That's a reasonable hypothesis. But it's also the kind of hypothesis that sounds like it was reverse-engineered from a market event rather than discovered through years of wrestling with the problem. The question I keep coming back to is: would Mathias have built this company if Bench hadn't died?

Actually, he might have. Mathias Løvring was a CFO at Female Invest, founded his own accountancy practice, and describes the specific pain of "chasing external accountants, correcting their mistakes and spending hours on manual processes." That's organic. He experienced accounting from both sides -- as the client who needed accurate books, and as the practitioner trying to deliver them. He knows where the process breaks. This isn't someone who read about AI accounting in a newsletter and assembled a team. The problem found him. That matters.

But here's where my schlep blindness framework cuts the other way. Schlep blindness works when the problem is obvious but everyone unconsciously avoids it because the work is ugly. Stripe was like that -- every programmer knew payments were broken, but nobody wanted to deal with banks and PCI compliance. AI accounting in 2026 is the opposite. It's a category where everyone is rushing in. Digits has $97 million. Zeni has $51 million. Pilot has over $220 million and was valued at $1.2 billion. Truewind came through YC itself two years ago. When five well-funded companies are already attacking the same schlep, the schlep isn't hidden anymore -- it's consensus. And I've observed that the most impressive companies I've seen recently are not working on the thing everyone else is working on. The LLM capabilities that enable transaction categorization and reconciliation are available to everyone. Balance's positioning as a "full-service accountancy" rather than software is a genuine strategic choice, but it's not a moat. It's a business model decision that any competitor could replicate next quarter.

The team is competent but assembled rather than inevitable. Mathias brings the domain expertise. Gus Levinson brings real AI credentials -- Oxford research, Imperial MSc, built AI products at three startups. Emil Munk brings McKinsey consulting rigor and product experience at two YC companies. These are good ingredients. But no shared employer or university connects all three founders. They appear to have come together from different orbits in the YC ecosystem specifically to start this company. I've seen this pattern before -- in one batch, nine companies added co-founders who were essentially strangers, and all nine fell apart within a year. I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but the co-founder relationship should predate the startup, and there's no evidence it does.

The bull case deserves serious attention. If Balance can achieve 90%+ AI automation with humans reviewing only exceptions, the cost structure is fundamentally different from Bench's. Bench was paying full-time bookkeepers to do manual work at scale. Balance could theoretically serve the same customer base at a fraction of the labor cost. The 35,000 displaced Bench customers represent real, immediate demand -- these are SMBs who were already paying for managed bookkeeping and suddenly need a new provider. If Mathias's team can capture even a slice of that diaspora while the AI improves, the flywheel could work. And the market is genuinely enormous -- $688 billion in accounting services globally. The flat-rate model aligned with AI leverage is the right structural bet if you're going to play in this space. Mathias's dual perspective (client and practitioner) gives him an edge in designing the service correctly, and Gus appears to be a real builder rather than just a credential-holder, with 20 public repos and hands-on AI product experience.

But I keep returning to the competitive dynamics. When I funded Stripe, the Collisons had years of runway before serious competition materialized, because the schlep was genuinely hidden. Balance enters a field where Digits just reported 11x revenue growth in 2024 and multiple competitors launched their own AI accounting agents in 2025. Competing against companies with 20 to 60 times your funding isn't impossible -- we've seen it work when the smaller company has a genuine insight the bigger ones lack. I'm not convinced Balance has that insight. "AI plus human review" is the same architecture everyone is converging on. The "replace your accountant entirely" positioning is bolder than "sell tools to accountants," but it also means Balance assumes professional liability for the accuracy of books and tax filings, which is a regulatory and legal surface area that pure software companies avoid.

This is a real problem with a founder who genuinely lived it, entering a market where the timing could work. But the competitive density, the assembled team, and the absence of any early traction signal that would distinguish Balance from the field make this a pass for me. I'd want to see evidence that their AI accuracy rates are meaningfully better than what Digits or Zeni are achieving, or that they've retained Bench refugees at rates that suggest genuine product love. Right now, the dossier shows a competent team in a crowded lane with no differentiating signal beyond Mathias's personal experience.
