# Payna -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out to me about Paena -- or Payna, depending on which page you're looking at -- is that the company listed on YC as "crypto/fintech compliance simplified" is actually building earned wage access for hourly workers. That disconnect tells me something. It could mean these founders are iterating fast and landed on something better, which I respect. But it could also mean they're searching for a problem to attach their technical skills to, and that's a pattern I've learned to be cautious about. The best founders I've backed weren't looking for a use case -- the use case was burning a hole in them.

So I want to hear their story. Aaron Chen dropped out of Berkeley at 19, built a library tracking app the university acquired, grew a college founder platform to 50,000 users, and designed the product at an a16z-backed DeFi startup where seven figures of deposits flowed through his work. He Song interned at Gemini and built an AI course scheduler. These are clearly talented, energetic builders -- the kind of young people who make things happen. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "why are THESE founders building THIS company?" -- I don't hear the answer I need. Neither of them appears to have lived the experience of being a paycheck-to-paycheck worker desperate for $100 before Friday. They came from the crypto world and found an application for their skills. That's the opposite direction from what gives me conviction. When I invested in the early days of Affirm, the signal wasn't "smart engineers who can build lending infrastructure" -- it was that the founders understood at a bone-deep level why hidden credit card fees were predatory. The biographical thread connecting founder to problem is what tells me someone will keep going when everything breaks.

Now, here's what I find genuinely interesting: the architecture itself has a kind of elegance that catches my attention. DeFi liquidity pools funded by yield-seeking crypto investors, automatically dispersed as dollar-denominated wage advances to workers who never see a wallet address or a blockchain transaction. That's taking an invisible system -- the billions sitting in DeFi vaults earning yield for crypto insiders -- and making it visible as economic access for people who need cash today. That pattern resonates deeply with what I saw in Affirm making interest rates transparent, or Carta making cap tables visible. If Paena's claim of operating at 5% of legacy EWA costs holds up, this could genuinely move the needle for tens of millions of workers. The structural insight that DailyPay and PayActiv can't copy this model without cannibalizing their employer partnerships -- that's real. That's the kind of business model conflict that creates space for a new entrant.

But I have to be honest about what worries me. The competitive landscape here is not the kind of empty field I prefer. DailyPay is at $1.75 billion with $235 million in revenue. EarnIn is already direct-to-consumer and backed by a16z. Clair is embedded in Gusto and TriNet. And Toku just announced a stablecoin-powered EWA partnership that hits similar notes. Using DeFi for wage advances sounds weird -- and I like weird -- but crypto fintech is actually a hot category right now. YC is literally investing in stablecoins. When the ecosystem is already leaning in, the weirdness discount I normally count on gets arbitraged away. Compare this to Crusoe Energy, which was genuinely dismissed by everyone as absurd when we backed it. "Crypto-powered fintech" in 2026 doesn't carry that same outsider energy.

The regulatory complexity is real and could become a moat, but I see no evidence these founders have started navigating it. State-by-state EWA regulation, money transmission licensing, securities classification of LP deposits -- this is the kind of multi-layered compliance maze that requires specialized counsel and a founder who understands regulatory strategy, not just engineering. My background in security at IronPort taught me to respect regulated spaces and to look for founders who can work within the system rather than ignore it. I don't see that signal here. The LP cold start problem is also severe -- you need funded vaults before you can serve your first worker, and convincing DeFi yield-seekers to deposit into an unproven consumer lending protocol is a real chicken-and-egg challenge with no clear bootstrapping strategy described.

If I force myself to articulate the bull case: these are 19-year-old builders who've already shipped products used by tens of thousands of people, working at the exact intersection of DeFi and consumer finance right as stablecoin regulation crystallizes. The GENIUS Act, ERC-4626 maturity, and real-time payment rails all converged in the last twelve months. If Aaron and He Song are the kind of founders who will live inside the paycheck-to-paycheck experience -- if they go drive for Uber or work restaurant shifts to understand their users the way I found Uber through my driver Roger -- then the technical foundation they've built could become something meaningful. The economic access thesis is strong on paper. What's missing is the evidence that this team is solving their own pain rather than applying their skillset to someone else's problem.
