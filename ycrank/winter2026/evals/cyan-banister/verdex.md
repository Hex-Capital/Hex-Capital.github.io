# Verdex -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that immediately catches my attention about Verdex is the tension between two facts that don't easily coexist: these founders claim to be helping insure over 11% of all American farmland -- roughly 59 million acres -- and yet neither of them has any documented connection to agriculture, insurance, or the rural economy. That's either the most remarkable pre-seed traction I've seen from a pair of recent college graduates, or the word "helping" is doing an enormous amount of heavy lifting in that sentence. I've learned to trust bold claims from founders when their biography explains why they're the ones making them. Here, I can't find that thread, and that matters to me more than any satellite resolution spec or TAM figure.

When I sit with a founder, I don't want the pitch first. I want to know how they got to this room. Jad is from Morocco -- and Morocco has a real agricultural economy, so maybe there's a story there about watching crops fail and seeing families destroyed by slow insurance processes. But nothing in the public record tells me that. What I do see is a Math/CS student who previously pitched YC with something called "SignPact" and then pivoted to agriculture intelligence. Evan won an engineering prize for an ML project diagnosing autism and then worked at Meta in client solutions. Both are clearly capable -- the technical chops are there. But capability isn't what I evaluate first. I evaluate whether the founder and the problem are fused together at a biographical level, whether this person has been circling this specific problem long enough that they see angles nobody else can see. I backed Contraline because its founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone in venture would touch it. That biographical commitment told me everything I needed to know about his ability to endure the long regulatory slog ahead. With Verdex, I don't have that signal, and at this stage, that signal is what I pay for.

The idea itself is sensible, which is actually part of my concern. Using satellite imagery to streamline crop insurance claims isn't contrarian -- it's the obvious next step as remote sensing costs fall and imagery resolution improves. Ceres AI has raised over $86 million building adjacent capabilities. EOSDA is already serving insurers. Farmonaut claims 95% accuracy in acreage assessment. When I look for investments, I look for ideas that are unpopular and difficult to assess, where the consensus is that the founders are a little crazy. Verdex doesn't trigger that response. It triggers "of course someone should build this" -- which means someone already is, and the question becomes execution speed and enterprise sales relationships in a market with only 16 possible customers. That's a fine business challenge, but it's not the kind of bet where my particular instincts add value.

The strongest bull case is real, and I want to be honest about it. If that 11% traction claim holds up -- if these founders have genuinely integrated with even one major AIP and are monitoring 59 million acres -- then they've accomplished something extraordinary for a two-person pre-seed team, and my concerns about biographical fit become less important. Enterprise sales in federal agriculture programs are notoriously difficult, and cracking even one relationship would demonstrate a kind of hustle and resourcefulness that matters. The concentrated buyer base (16 AIPs) is actually appealing -- you don't need to boil the ocean, you need to close a handful of accounts, and once you're embedded in their claims workflow with years of historical data, switching costs become real. The timing convergence of declining satellite costs, improving AI, and growing strain on manual inspection processes could make this a genuine infrastructure play. And there's an economic access angle I appreciate: farmers waiting months for claim settlements after a devastating weather event need faster resolution, and making damage assessment objective rather than subjective protects smaller operators who don't have political leverage with adjusters. That pattern of making an invisible system transparent is one I've invested behind many times.

But I keep coming back to the regulatory dependency that the dossier flags, and the founders' apparent lack of institutional knowledge in navigating it. The Federal Crop Insurance Program has specific rules about how claims are verified. If USDA regulations require physical field inspection for certain claim types, Verdex's core premise -- settling claims without leaving the desk -- hits a wall that no amount of satellite resolution can solve. This is exactly the kind of regulatory complexity where I normally lean in, because regulatory moats protect founders who can navigate them. But the moat only works if the founders have mapped the regulatory terrain, and I see no evidence of that domain depth here. When I backed investments in defense tech or financial regulation or psychedelic therapy, I could see that the founders understood the specific regulatory pathways they'd need to navigate. With Verdex, I'm being asked to believe two recent Dartmouth graduates with no agricultural or insurance background will successfully navigate USDA bureaucracy and win enterprise contracts with entrenched insurance carriers -- without a biographical reason to believe they'll persist when the regulatory walls go up.

I'd pass on this one from my own checkbook. The technical capability is there, the market timing is plausible, and the concentrated buyer structure is actually elegant. But the founders' story doesn't explain why they're building this specific company, the idea isn't weird enough to activate my conviction radar, and the competitive landscape includes well-capitalized players who could absorb this positioning overnight. I need to feel that jolt -- that moment where the founder's history and the company's mission lock together and I can see why nobody else could build this. I don't feel it here.
