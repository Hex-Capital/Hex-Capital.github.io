# CellType -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that immediately jumps out about CellType: David van Dijk might be the most academically credentialed founder I've seen come through YC in years. Nearly 9,000 citations. Creator of MAGIC and PHATE -- two methods that practically every computational biologist uses. NSF CAREER Award. A collaboration with Google DeepMind that resulted in the CEO of Google personally amplifying his research to 7 million people. And he turned down Google to start this company. On the "sane" axis, this registers about as high as possible. The problem is the other half of the equation. "AI for drug discovery" is not an insane idea. It is, in fact, one of the most capital-saturated, consensus-validated categories in all of technology right now. Isomorphic Labs has $600 million. Recursion has $461 million. Insilico just IPO'd. Valo has multi-billion-dollar pharma deals. When I see a category where every major pharma company is already signing nine-figure partnerships with incumbents, the "insane idea" premium has been completely arbitraged away. You're buying narrative at market price. Van Dijk is a brilliant, credible person pursuing an idea that most investors think is exciting -- and that's precisely the configuration I find least interesting.

Now, the specific technical approach -- Cell2Sentence, converting single-cell gene expression data into language sequences that LLMs can natively reason about -- does have genuine novelty. It's a real intellectual contribution. ICML 2024 is a serious venue. The idea that biological states can be translated into a format amenable to transformer architectures is conceptually beautiful and potentially foundational. If I squint, I can see a world where Cell2Sentence becomes a new primitive -- the underlying representation layer that all biological AI is built on. That would satisfy my "protocol position" criterion. But here's what only someone with my particular set of scars would notice: they published it. The paper is out. The models are on Hugging Face. The code has 809 stars on GitHub. They created a genuine primitive and then open-sourced it. Venmo worked because we controlled the payment rail. Solana worked because the protocol was the product. When you give away the primitive, you become the author of the Wikipedia article, not the owner of the infrastructure. Google DeepMind co-built the scaled version and has every incentive and capability to productize it through Isomorphic Labs whenever it becomes commercially interesting. Van Dijk could end up in the same position as the Transformer paper authors -- he created something foundational and then watched someone with more distribution capture the value.

This brings me to the structural moat question, which is where CellType most directly collides with my framework. I've been saying for two years that AI is a bad startup investment because incumbents with distribution win. CellType is the embodiment of the pattern I warn about: AI IS the product. Remove the AI and there is no business. There are no painting crews, no parking garages, no physical infrastructure that software amplifies but cannot replace. The entire value proposition is computational. When I run my "cherry on top" test -- would this be a good business if AI didn't exist? -- the answer is definitively no. The agentic pipeline layer is proprietary, but "we orchestrate AI agents better than anyone else" is exactly the kind of moat that dissolves when the next model generation makes orchestration trivially easier. And the Google dependency creates a particularly uncomfortable dynamic: your core technology is built on Google's Gemma architecture, co-developed with Google's research arm, while Google's drug discovery subsidiary is one of your primary competitors. That's not a partnership -- that's building your house on someone else's land.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement because the founder quality is exceptional. If Cell2Sentence truly establishes itself as the representation standard for cellular biology -- the way BERT became the standard for NLP tasks -- then being the academic originator confers lasting advantage in pharma relationships, talent recruitment, and institutional trust. Pharma companies are deeply conservative about their discovery pipelines; they buy credibility as much as capability, and van Dijk has more of it than almost anyone in computational biology. The "virtual human" narrative has genuine infinity optionality -- simulate all of human biology, and you've created a platform for drug discovery, disease prediction, personalized medicine, clinical trial design. That's an elastic narrative that can absorb new developments and grow rather than narrow. And the 100% inbound deal generation with Top 10 pharma suggests the credibility signal is already converting to commercial interest. If van Dijk can build a proprietary data layer from pharma collaborations -- validation datasets, fine-tuning on proprietary patient data, integration into pharma workflows -- the switching costs could eventually create real lock-in. The question is whether he gets there before Google or a well-funded competitor replicates the approach with superior distribution.

But that question is exactly why I pass. The structural logic doesn't favor the startup in this configuration. The core methodology is published. The model is open-source. The primary technology partner is also a competitor. The category is consensus. And the moat is entirely digital with no physical or regulatory anchor. I've seen this movie before -- Birchbox taught me that narrative magnitude without structural moat produces the worst possible venture outcome. CellType has an extraordinary founder and a compelling narrative, but the defensibility architecture makes me deeply uncomfortable. The company that captures value from Cell2Sentence might not be CellType -- it might be Isomorphic Labs running van Dijk's methods on Google's compute with Eli Lilly's $1.75 billion partnership. I'd rather fund a drug company with a tech layer than a tech company with a drug layer.
