# Zymbly -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Zymbly is a tension that almost perfectly splits my investment framework in half. On one side: Robbie Bourke was Head of Aircraft Maintenance at Virgin Atlantic. He didn't read about technicians drowning in paperwork -- he managed the technicians who were drowning in paperwork. He watched them flip through manuals and type up compliance documentation for half their shifts, year after year, across a 25-year career that also included designing aircraft at Airbus. That is about as organic as problem discovery gets. On the other side: all three founders are former Oliver Wyman consultants. No public GitHub repos among them. No evidence anyone built a prototype in their apartment because they couldn't stop thinking about the problem. The team formation looks like three consultants deciding to start a company together, not three obsessed people who couldn't help themselves.

The schlep here is real and substantial. Aviation maintenance documentation is governed by FAA, EASA, and CAA regulations. Part 145 operations. CAME standards. A single documentation error can ground an aircraft or, worse, contribute to a crash. You need ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II compliance. You're selling to airlines with 12-18 month procurement cycles, dealing with unions, navigating safety culture that is deeply skeptical of anything labeled "AI." Most founders building AI copilots unconsciously filter this entire domain out of their mental idea space -- they build copilots for software engineers or salespeople or lawyers instead. The fact that 43,000 aircraft technicians will be missing from North American hangars by 2027, and nobody has built a decent voice-first tool for the ones who remain, is a textbook case of schlep blindness. The problem has been sitting there, obvious, for years. Zymbly is one of the few teams willing to walk into it.

The positioning is smart in a way that suggests real industry knowledge. Rather than building another MRO ERP system to compete with Ramco or CAMP -- companies with decades of installed base -- Zymbly sits on top of existing systems as an AI layer. This is the approach that works in entrenched enterprise markets: don't ask customers to rip and replace, ask them to augment. It's analogous to what made Stripe's initial approach work -- the Collisons didn't try to replace payment processors, they made them accessible through a better interface. Zymbly is doing the same thing for MRO software that technicians already use but hate interacting with.

But here's what gives me pause: this team's DNA is consulting and corporate management, not building. The CTO, Azmat Habibullah, has a strong math background from Imperial and four years of ML work in regulated industries, which is relevant. He started programming at eleven, which is a genuine signal. But there's no public code from anyone on this team. No GitHub repos. No evidence of the hacker intensity where someone stays up all night because they can't stop building. Ben Jacob "led Applied AI" at Multiverse, but leading AI at an edtech company is a management function, not a building function. When I look at the companies I've backed that worked -- Stripe, Dropbox, Reddit, Replit -- the founders were the ones writing the code. I can't tell if that's happening here. And Bourke's commitment is ambiguous: his LinkedIn still reads like someone with six advisory roles. Is he all-in, or is this one of several projects?

The bull case is worth articulating because the domain expertise is exceptional enough to partially override my hacker-founder preference. If Bourke is genuinely full-time and the CTO is genuinely building, not managing vendors, then this team has something most AI startups lack entirely: the person who ran the operation they're automating. The design partnership with an unnamed major airline is thin evidence but not nothing -- airlines don't waste time on partnerships with companies that don't address real pain. If that partnership converts to a paying contract, and if the voice-first interface actually works in a noisy hangar environment, Zymbly could accumulate a domain-specific data moat that commodity RAG tools can't replicate. The labor shortage creates genuine buyer urgency, which shortens enterprise sales cycles. And the regulatory schlep that scares everyone else away is exactly what protects a first mover. This is a company where the moat is the pain of building the company itself.

I land in the middle on Zymbly. The organic problem discovery through Bourke's career is one of the strongest domain-founder connections I've seen at pre-seed. The schlep is massive and real. But the team reads more like a consulting engagement than a startup -- three Oliver Wyman alumni building what consultants would build, using the process consultants would use. The best startups in regulated industries still need a hacker at the core who builds obsessively. I don't see clear evidence of that here, and the "AI copilot for X" framing, even in a genuinely underserved vertical, makes me cautious about whether the technology itself is defensible beyond the domain knowledge wrapped around it. I'd want to meet the team and watch the CTO demo the product before writing a check.
