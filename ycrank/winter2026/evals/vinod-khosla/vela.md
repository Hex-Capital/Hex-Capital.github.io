# Vela -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here are two brothers who co-founded a microfinance organization at fourteen that disbursed $400,000 in interest-free loans across 77 countries. One graduated Wharton Huntsman Summa Cum Laude and worked at BCG AI. The other finished a dual degree at Carnegie Mellon in two years with highest honors, built infrastructure on AWS's ML Supercompute team, worked at Perplexity, and dropped out of a UChicago Booth dual-degree program to build this company. The Diana Legacy Award. The Obama-Chesky Voyager scholarship. A patent at sixteen. And what did they decide to build? A scheduling assistant. That mismatch between the caliber of the founders and the scale of the problem is the defining feature of this company for me. It is also the reason I pass.

Let me be direct about consequence magnitude. If Vela succeeds completely -- if it works perfectly across every channel, captures the entire enterprise scheduling coordination market, and displaces Calendly as the default -- what changes? Recruiters save time booking interviews. Sales teams reduce scheduling friction. Law firms manage calendars more efficiently. That is a real business. It might even be a good business. But nobody's life is fundamentally altered. No industry becomes obsolete. No trillion-dollar system gets replaced. The cited TAM is $3 billion today, growing to $34 billion. Fine. But I did not invest in Impossible Foods because the plant-based meat market was projected to grow at an attractive CAGR. I invested because the consequence of eliminating animal agriculture -- half the world's arable land, a quarter of its freshwater -- was so staggering that the bet justified itself regardless of financial projections. Scheduling coordination is not a problem too important not to work on. It is an administrative friction.

The technology compounds this concern. An LLM-based agent that negotiates scheduling over email and WhatsApp is genuinely useful and represents a real product architecture departure from Calendly's booking links. But the dossier itself identifies the core vulnerability: this capability is "technically replicable by any team with access to frontier language models and calendar/communication APIs." There is no structural moat. No proprietary science. No patent wall. Google owns the calendar infrastructure, the email platform, and a frontier LLM. Microsoft owns the other calendar infrastructure, the other email platform, and access to GPT-4. Calendly has $352 million in funding and a $3 billion valuation. The moment conversational scheduling becomes obviously valuable -- and Vela is proving that it is -- every incumbent can build it as a feature. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router for public telecom. The structural insight was that Cisco's architecture couldn't adapt. I see no equivalent structural barrier preventing Calendly or Google from adding a conversational scheduling layer to their existing dominance.

The strongest bull case is that scheduling is a wedge into something much larger -- that Vela's real play is autonomous AI agents handling all forms of business communication and coordination, not just calendar negotiation. If the agent paradigm that works for scheduling extends to procurement, legal correspondence, sales outreach, and customer service, then the consequence of success scales dramatically. Square started as a credit card reader -- a seemingly modest problem -- and became a financial infrastructure company. Could Vela follow that path? Possibly. But the company positions itself as "The AI Scheduling Assistant that truly knows you." The ambition as articulated is a scheduling tool. If the founders had described a vision for replacing all human business coordination -- and scheduling was merely the first proof point -- I would evaluate differently. The ambition as stated matches the product as built: making scheduling better.

What strikes me about the founding team is not what they chose to build but what they chose not to. A teenager who builds a microfinance network spanning 77 countries has demonstrated exactly the kind of irreverent ambition and operational tenacity I look for. An engineer who did meaningful work at Perplexity and AWS ML Supercompute understands frontier AI infrastructure. These two could be attacking a problem where the consequence of success reshapes an industry. Instead, they optimized for a clear market with identifiable customers and known demand -- enterprise recruiters, sales teams. They reduced their probability of failure. And in doing so, they made the consequence of their success, in my framework, inconsequential. The timing is real -- LLM capabilities have genuinely crossed the threshold needed for conversational scheduling, and two competitors got acquired in 2024, opening space. But favorable timing in a small-consequence category does not change my calculus. I would tell these founders what I tell many talented teams: you are too capable to spend the next decade making calendars marginally smarter. Find a problem that terrifies you and matters at a scale the world cannot ignore.
