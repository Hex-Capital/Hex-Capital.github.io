# Bubble Lab -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive dynamics here tell the entire story before I even get to the team. Zapier has $310M in revenue, 8,000+ integrations, and has already launched AI-powered automation features. n8n raised $240M at a $2.5B valuation and integrated LangChain with 70+ AI-dedicated nodes. Make was acquired by Celonis at a $13B parent valuation. Bubble Lab has 16 integrations and a Slack bot. This isn't a market where a structural shift is opening a window for startups -- it's a market where incumbents are actively shipping the exact capability Bubble Lab claims as its differentiation. When I invested in Harvey, the key structural insight was that law firms and legacy legal tech companies were organizationally incapable of building AI-native products. The incumbents in workflow automation face no such constraint. Zapier adding a natural language interface to its 8,000 integrations is a product feature, not a rearchitecture.

The "why now" here is generic: LLMs crossed a capability threshold for natural-language-to-API-call translation. That's true, but it's the same "why now" that applies to every AI wrapper company I see. A real structural moment creates asymmetric advantage for new entrants over incumbents -- the way defense procurement barriers after Project Maven created a vacuum only Anduril could fill, or the way developer-first payment APIs required a fundamentally different architecture than PayPal's. Here, the structural moment benefits Zapier and n8n more than it benefits Bubble Lab, because the hard part of workflow automation was always the integrations (connecting to thousands of tools reliably), not the interface for triggering them. LLMs make the interface easier, which is nice -- but the 8,000-integration moat gets stronger, not weaker.

The Slack-native angle is a distribution choice, not a distribution moat. Building inside Slack means you're a feature on someone else's platform. Slack is actively investing in AI features -- if they build native workflow automation, Bubble Lab faces existential risk. Compare this to Stripe, which built payment infrastructure that the platforms depended on, not the other way around. Or PagerDuty, which became the operations layer independent of any single communication tool. Bubble Lab's product doesn't become a distribution channel for additional products -- it remains a Slack app. The open-source component with 1,000 GitHub stars is a modest community signal, but they've stopped accepting contributions as of January 2026, which neutralizes the community-driven development advantage while leaving the codebase forkable under Apache 2.0. That's the worst of both worlds.

The strongest bull case would be this: Zapier's visual builder is a pre-LLM paradigm, and the shift from explicit rule-building to natural language prompting is as fundamental as command-line to GUI. An AI-native company unburdened by legacy product architecture could build a categorically different product that makes Zapier feel like building spreadsheet formulas by hand. The 3,800 users at pre-seed suggest real pull. And the "long-term memory" feature -- where Pearl learns organizational processes over time -- could create genuine switching costs. If I believed that the interface paradigm shift was large enough to overcome the integration gap, this would be a compelling entry point into a massive market. But the dossier itself notes that the core capability is "technically reproducible," and n8n has no structural barrier to adding the same features. When the differentiation reduces to "better UX" rather than a structural advantage, you're competing on execution against companies with 100x your resources and existing distribution. A smart toaster with a Slack integration is still a toaster.

The founders have demonstrated real execution velocity -- shipping a product with 3,800 users, obtaining SOC 2 Type 1 certification, and building 16 integrations, all at pre-seed stage with a two-person team. That's operationally impressive. The pivot from gymii.ai (consumer nutrition tracking) to B2B workflow automation is a significant domain shift that raises questions about conviction depth, but pivoting is normal at this stage and the new product clearly has more structural logic. Selina Li's JPMorgan quant background provides some exposure to enterprise operations workflows, and Zach Zhong's experience as a 3x founding engineer shows building capability. But neither founder has deep domain expertise in workflow automation or operations tooling -- they're competent generalists who entered this market recently, which is exactly the late-cycle diversification pattern I watch for.

This is a pass. The market is consensus, the incumbents are already shipping the differentiation, the platform dependency creates existential risk, and the product doesn't have a clear path to becoming a distribution channel. The founders can build, but they're bringing a knife to a gunfight where Zapier has 8,000 integrations and n8n has $240M in funding. I need to see a structural moment that creates asymmetric advantage for new entrants, and I don't see one here.
