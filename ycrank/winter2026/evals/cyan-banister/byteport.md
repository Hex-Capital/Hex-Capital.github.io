# Byteport -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Byteport: this is one of the least weird companies I've seen in a while. And for me, that's the problem. File transfer acceleration is a market that IBM cared enough about to acquire Aspera. Signiant has $42.5 million in revenue and 400,000 users. FileCatalyst won an Emmy. MASV raised $4 million and charges a third of what Byteport charges. UDP-based protocol acceleration has been productized for over a decade. When I look at a space and see a dozen well-funded, well-established players all solving the same problem with the same fundamental technical approach, I know I'm looking at a consensus market. The most promising companies are not popular — but fast file transfer is extremely popular. Every enterprise IT buyer knows they need it. Every VC understands the value proposition. There's nothing here that makes investors squirm, nothing that sounds insane at first blush and then reveals itself as grounded in real insight. This is a better mousetrap pitch in an established category, and that's not where I invest.

When I think about the founder, Jayram Palamadai, I want to hear the story behind the business — the thing that makes this problem personal and inescapable for him. What I see is an academically exceptional young person: IMSA, National Merit Scholar, full-ride scholarships, research at Fermilab starting around fifteen or sixteen. That's genuinely impressive on its own terms. But it's not the biographical grit I evaluate. There's no survival narrative here, no hardship that forged an unbreakable connection to this specific problem. The Fermilab and CERN work means he's been around large datasets, yes — particle physics generates extraordinary data volumes. And the Netflix claim, if it holds up, would provide relevant domain context. But "I worked at places that move a lot of data" is professional exposure, not the kind of lived obsession that tells me someone will keep going when everything falls apart. I also notice the website says "built by the team that developed Netflix Workstations" for what is a solo founder company with a team size of one. That kind of credibility framing — making "I" sound like "we" — is the opposite of the raw authenticity I filter for. It might be smart marketing, but it sets off the wrong signal for me.

The economic access dimension is where this company goes particularly quiet for my framework. When I backed Uber, I saw a company that would create income streams for hundreds of thousands of drivers. Affirm made credit transparent for people being exploited by hidden fees. Thumbtack connected skilled tradespeople to customers. I'm always asking: who gains access to something they didn't have before? Byteport's customers are VFX studios, AI companies, satellite operators, autonomous vehicle teams — these are some of the most well-resourced organizations on the planet. Making their file transfers faster is a genuine operational improvement, but it doesn't open doors for anyone who was previously locked out. It doesn't make an invisible system visible. It's an efficiency tool for enterprises that already have budgets.

To be fair, let me articulate what would have to be true for this to be a great investment. If Jayram really did build core infrastructure at Netflix — not as an intern or a research rotation but as someone who architected the systems that move petabytes of media assets — and if the protocol genuinely delivers 2-4x speed advantages over Signiant and Aspera under real production conditions, then the timing argument has teeth. AI model training requires moving massive datasets between compute clusters, and that need is growing exponentially. A self-serve, pay-per-GB tool that eliminates the enterprise sales process of an Aspera deployment could capture the long tail of AI startups and mid-market studios that can't afford or don't want to deploy complex enterprise infrastructure. The VFX beachhead is smart because speed literally translates to revenue in post-production — faster delivery means more projects completed per quarter. And if switching costs develop through workflow integrations like render-completion triggers and automated sync, there could be retention beyond just protocol speed. That's a real business. But it's a business I'd expect to see pitched by someone with ten years of infrastructure experience and a co-founder who can sell into enterprise procurement — not an eighteen-year-old working alone.

The solo founder dimension compounds my concerns here. I think about HQ Trivia as my reminder that team dynamics matter more than product-market fit, but I also think about it the other direction — being entirely alone in an enterprise B2B market with long sales cycles, complex procurement, and well-funded competitors is its own kind of crisis waiting to happen. At eighteen, with no prior company-building experience, no disclosed advisors beyond YC partners, no engineering hires, and no one listed as even considering joining — that's a lot of weight on one person. YC provides a support structure, but that structure is temporary. The MASV pricing comparison alone ($0.05/GB versus $0.15/GB) creates a competitive conversation that requires sales sophistication and customer relationships to navigate, and I don't see evidence of how that gets built by one person.

I respect the ambition and the academic trajectory. Dropping a full-ride at Georgia Tech at eighteen to build something takes a certain kind of courage. But courage and thesis fit are different things. I'm looking for founders whose personal history makes the problem inescapable, for ideas that sound ridiculous to other investors, for companies that create access where exclusion existed before. Byteport is a competent-seeming infrastructure play in a well-understood market by a young founder with relevant but unverified domain exposure. It's the kind of company that a lot of good investors could get behind — but that's exactly why it's not my kind of bet.
