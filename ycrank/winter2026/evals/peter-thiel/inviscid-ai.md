# Inviscid AI -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first thing that demands attention, because it tells you everything about whether a secret exists. PassiveLogic has raised $125 million to build physics-based digital twins for buildings. PhysicsX has accumulated roughly $170 million applying physics-informed AI to engineering simulation. BrainBox AI was acquired by Trane Technologies in December 2024, giving it access to one of the largest HVAC distribution networks on earth. 75F has $81 million and 1,800 installations across nine countries. Johnson Controls has invested directly in PassiveLogic. NVIDIA's venture arm is backing multiple players in the category. When I look at this picture, I see something very specific: the absence of a secret. "Physics-informed AI can optimize building energy systems" is not a contrarian insight -- it is a consensus thesis with over half a billion dollars in competing capital already deployed against it. Everyone can see this opportunity. That is precisely why it is not an opportunity in the sense that matters.

The founding team presents an interesting surface-level pattern. Kabir Jain is nineteen years old, a gold medalist at the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence. I have backed nineteen-year-olds before -- Zuckerberg was nineteen when I wrote the Facebook check, Buterin received the Thiel Fellowship at the same age. But the comparison illuminates what is missing rather than what is present. Zuckerberg had a specific, non-obvious insight about human identity and social behavior that most people actively rejected. Buterin had a vision for programmable money that the financial establishment considered absurd. What is Jain's contrarian belief about the world? That neural networks can approximate fluid dynamics equations faster than traditional numerical methods? This is a finding published by Raissi, Perdikaris, and Karniadis in 2019 and now pursued by well-funded companies on multiple continents. An IOAI gold medal demonstrates exceptional raw capability in AI competition -- but competition performance is not the same as a vision for how the world should change. And Ziming Qiu, the co-founder with PhD-level depth, researches computer vision and medical image segmentation at NYU -- domains with no obvious connection to computational fluid dynamics, HVAC controls, or building science. Neither founder has documented experience with the actual domain they claim to transform.

The case studies on the website reveal what I consider a deeper structural problem. Three demonstrations span HVAC vent optimization, coastal infrastructure stress analysis, and storm surge forecasting -- three entirely different application domains. This is the signature of a general-purpose technical capability searching for a market, not a company built around a definite vision. It resembles what I call indefinite optimism: the founders have built something that works, they believe something good will come of it, but they do not yet have a specific plan for what the world looks like if they succeed. The building HVAC positioning may have been selected because YC and the market validate it, not because the founders have a deep conviction about building physics specifically. When I contrast this with Palantir -- where we spent seven years executing a specific vision for how PayPal's fraud algorithms would transform intelligence analysis, without pivoting, without hedging across adjacent domains -- the difference in definiteness is stark.

The strongest bull case would require several things to be true simultaneously. First, that the data center cooling segment is genuinely differentiated from the broader building HVAC market -- that cooling AI compute infrastructure at scale presents physics problems so different from conventional buildings that a specialized solution can achieve monopoly in that niche before expanding. Second, that Jain's raw technical brilliance will produce a PINNs implementation so superior that it constitutes proprietary technology rather than applied academic research. Third, that the two-person team can build domain expertise in building science fast enough to compete with PassiveLogic's integrated hardware-software stack and Trane's global distribution. I take the data center angle seriously -- cooling represents 30-40% of energy costs in AI compute facilities, and the construction surge creates genuine urgency. If Inviscid AI had articulated a specific, contrarian thesis about data center thermal management -- something the well-funded competitors were missing -- I could see a path. But the website case studies do not mention data centers at all. The positioning appears inferred rather than demonstrated.

The technology claim of 1000x speedup over traditional CFD is genuinely significant in absolute terms -- if validated, it crosses the 10x threshold I require for proprietary technology advantage. But the method itself -- physics-informed neural networks for fluid dynamics -- is neither novel nor proprietary. The foundational research is published. PhysicsX has demonstrated the approach works at commercial scale across multiple engineering domains. ANSYS and Siemens have the resources and institutional knowledge to incorporate PINNs into their existing simulation platforms whenever they choose. A speed advantage built on published methods without proprietary architectural innovation is a temporary lead, not a structural moat. And in a market where Trane Technologies can simply acquire the leading AI optimization company -- as it did with BrainBox AI -- the last-mover position belongs to the incumbents who control the hardware and distribution, not to the startup that built a better algorithm.

This is a pass. The category is crowded with well-funded players converging on the same thesis, which means there is no secret to exploit and no path to monopoly that a pre-seed startup can credibly claim. The founders show raw technical talent but no documented domain conviction, no articulated vision for how the world changes, and no evidence of the kind of contrarian stubbornness that makes founders refuse easier paths. The scattered case studies across unrelated domains suggest a team exploring rather than executing. I have seen this pattern before in cleantech -- talented engineers applying real technology to a market that everyone agrees is important, surrounded by competitors doing the same thing, all destined to compete away any margin that might have existed. Important problems and real technology are necessary but not sufficient. Without a secret, you are just another participant in a mimetic competition that will destroy value for everyone involved.
