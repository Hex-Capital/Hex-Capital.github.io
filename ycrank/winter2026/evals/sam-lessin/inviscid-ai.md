# Inviscid AI -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what jumps out immediately: this is a company where AI is not the cherry on top — it's the entire dessert, the plate, and the table it sits on. Physics-informed neural networks for building HVAC simulation is the product, full stop. When I ask my basic diagnostic — would this business exist without AI? — the answer is an unambiguous no. That places Inviscid AI squarely in the category I'm most skeptical about. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because when the core value proposition is an AI technique published in academic literature (Raissi et al., 2019), you're building on a foundation that every well-resourced player can replicate. PhysicsX has $170M to do exactly this across engineering simulation. PassiveLogic has $125M+ and Johnson Controls as an investor. Trane Technologies bought BrainBox AI outright in December 2024. This isn't a contrarian bet against conventional wisdom — it's a foot race in a crowded lane with competitors carrying far more fuel.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't hit my filter the way I need it to. Kabir Jain winning gold at the inaugural International Olympiad in AI at 19 is genuinely impressive raw signal — competition medals at that level indicate serious technical ability. Ziming Qiu's PhD work in ML and computer vision at NYU brings legitimate research depth. These are clearly smart people. But "sane person, insane idea" requires a specific kind of sanity: domain credibility that makes the insane idea feel achievable. Neither founder has documented experience in building science, HVAC systems, BMS protocols, or facilities management. When I backed Teamshares, the founders understood small business operations with maniacal specificity. When Solana worked, Anatoly's Qualcomm systems engineering background was the "sane" that made the blockchain performance claims credible. Here, I see talented ML engineers applying a technique to a domain they haven't lived inside. The case studies spanning HVAC optimization, coastal infrastructure stress analysis, and storm surge forecasting reinforce this — it's a technology searching for its highest-value application, not founders with a burning insight about why buildings are broken.

The structural moat problem is severe through my lens. This is a software optimization layer that plugs into someone else's hardware — Honeywell's BMS, Johnson Controls' equipment, third-party IoT sensors. Inviscid AI owns none of the physical infrastructure. The moat claim rests on the technical difficulty of physics-informed neural networks, but that's a capability moat, and capability moats in AI dissolve on contact with well-funded competition. ANSYS and Siemens Digital Industries have every incentive and resource to incorporate PINNs into their existing CFD simulation suites. My entire thesis on why Craftwork works is that painting crews and scheduling logistics create an operational moat no software company can replicate. Inviscid AI has the opposite structure — it's all software, no operations, sitting on top of incumbents' hardware stack. That's precisely the architecture I've argued AI will commoditize fastest.

The strongest bull case I can construct: data centers are a genuinely extraordinary market right now. Cooling is 30-40% of total energy costs, the buildout pace driven by AI workloads is historic, and the tolerance for suboptimal cooling in a $50M+ facility is essentially zero. If Inviscid AI's physics-based approach is genuinely superior to data-driven methods for novel thermal conditions — and data centers present novel configurations constantly as GPU density increases — there's a wedge where speed and accuracy matter enough to command premium pricing even against incumbents. The "1000x faster than traditional CFD" claim, if validated in production, could make real-time thermal optimization feasible where it was previously impossible. But for this bull case to work, you need to believe a two-person team without building science expertise can outexecute PassiveLogic's 100+ person team with $125M and incumbent partnerships, while simultaneously navigating enterprise sales cycles that require on-site integration, BMS protocol expertise, and ongoing support. That's a lot of simultaneous breakthroughs required from founders who haven't demonstrated they can execute any one of them.

There's no evidence of a new primitive being created here. This is application-layer software — it consumes sensor data, runs simulations, and outputs HVAC recommendations. There are no network effects. Each building deployment doesn't make the next one fundamentally more valuable in a compounding way. The switching costs from BMS integration are real but modest — any competitor can integrate with BACnet and Modbus. Compare this to Aleo, where zero-knowledge proofs create a privacy primitive that entire ecosystems build on top of, or even Venmo, where the peer-to-peer payment network compounds with each user. Inviscid AI is a point solution, not a layer, and that caps the upside narrative regardless of how good the technology gets.
