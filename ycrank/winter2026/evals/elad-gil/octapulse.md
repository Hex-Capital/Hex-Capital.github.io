# OctaPulse -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Aquaculture hatchery QA is exactly the kind of market most investors dismiss without a second thought -- fish farming inspection software triggers the "too boring" and "too personally unfamiliar" reactions I've learned to pay attention to. PagerDuty got the same dismissive response. So did Gusto. The structural backdrop is real: aquaculture surpassed wild-catch fishing as the world's primary seafood source in 2024, which means hatchery throughput is now a binding constraint on a $327 billion global industry. Manual phenotyping at 5 minutes per fish is the kind of bottleneck that looks like a rounding error to outsiders but becomes an existential operational problem at scale. I'm drawn to this market archetype.

But when I ask "what has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this company possible now?", the answer gets soft. Computer vision for biological inspection has been technically feasible for several years. Edge-deployable models on off-the-shelf cameras aren't new -- that capability threshold was crossed before OctaPulse existed. The aquaculture surpassing wild-catch milestone is a gradual trend line, not a discrete inflection. Compare this to Harvey, where I could point to specific GPT scaling curves and predict when model fidelity would cross the legal-grade threshold within 12-18 months. Here, the "why now" is more "the market is growing steadily" than "a specific capability just became possible." That's the difference between a structural moment and a secular trend -- and I invest at structural moments.

The competitive picture concerns me more than the market timing. Aquaticode in Norway has $6M in funding, a 3M+ image database for AI phenotyping, can scan 10,000 fish per hour, and recently expanded into new species with a strategic advisor who's an industry veteran. That's not a hypothetical competitor -- that's a company doing the same thing with a significant data and deployment lead. And Tidal, spun out of Google X with 30 billion data points across 50 million fish, could move upstream into hatchery QA whenever they choose. OctaPulse's differentiation is geographic (U.S. entry point) and workflow-specific (hatchery-first rather than grow-out). Geographic advantage is real in aquaculture because farm relationships are local, but it's not a durable moat -- Aquaticode expanding to the U.S. is a sales investment, not a technical barrier.

The bull case deserves engagement. If OctaPulse nails hatchery QA and expands into feeding optimization, health monitoring, and processing -- the full farm management stack -- the product-to-distribution trajectory mirrors Gusto. Gusto entered through payroll, which seemed like a commodity feature, and became the HR platform for every small business. OctaPulse could enter through inspection and become the operating system for aquaculture operations. The 6-figure paid pilot with Riverence, the largest U.S. trout producer, is genuinely impressive pre-seed traction -- most YC companies at this stage have prototypes and letters of intent, not six-figure enterprise contracts. That signals the pain point is real and the willingness to pay exists. If they sign the two additional deployments planned for early 2026, the cross-species data flywheel starts compounding.

What holds me back is the compound of concerns. The founders are both still students at CMU with no aquaculture domain experience -- Grech's background is UX project management at Bloomberg, Singh's is mechanical engineering across semiconductor and automotive companies. Strong technical credentials, but selling to fish farmers who rely on decades of husbandry knowledge requires domain credibility they'll need to build from scratch. That's not disqualifying, but combined with a well-funded direct competitor, a gradual rather than inflection-like "why now," and the reality that computer vision for biological inspection is a known approach where the barrier is data access rather than algorithmic novelty, the plan starts requiring more than one thing to go right. They need the technical accuracy to generalize across species (partially demonstrated at 90-95%), the enterprise sales motion to outpace Aquaticode in the U.S. market, and the platform expansion to justify venture-scale returns beyond niche hatchery QA. That's not quite a multi-miracle plan, but it's more than the single-miracle clarity I look for.

I respect the market archetype and the early enterprise traction, but this is a pass for me. The structural moment isn't sharp enough, the competitive landscape is more developed than it appears at first glance, and the founders are entering from outside the industry. A boring market is necessary but not sufficient -- I also need to see that the adoption curve is inflecting at a specific moment where being early creates compounding advantages. Here, I see a steady growth market where a better-funded competitor already has a three-year head start on the data flywheel.
