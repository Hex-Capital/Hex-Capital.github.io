# Scout Out -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that immediately strikes me about Nolan Rossi is the fourth-generation construction connection. That's real. When I hear "fourth-generation family construction business," I know this person didn't read a TechCrunch article about construction tech and decide to build a startup. He grew up on job sites. He watched family members put together bids by hand, probably at the kitchen table. That biographical thread between the founder and the problem is the first thing I look for, and it's present here. But I want to be honest — there's a difference between a biographical connection and a biographical necessity. Nolan's trajectory reads as exceptional academic achievement: Berkeley's M.E.T. program, triple major, graduated in three years, Amazon, a consultancy scaled to $250K. That's an impressive resume. It's not a survival story. I didn't hear about the moment when the family business lost a bid that nearly broke them, or the crisis that made this problem feel existential rather than solvable. The domain roots are genuine, but the urgency that separates "I understand this problem" from "I cannot rest until I fix this problem" isn't coming through in what I can see.

What concerns me most is that AI construction estimation is a fully formed category with well-capitalized players already at scale. Beam AI has raised $30.5 million and serves over 1,200 contractors. STACK is doing $31.8 million in revenue. Togal.AI has $22.6 million in funding. This is not an idea that other investors find weird or difficult to assess — it's an idea they've already funded, multiple times, at serious scale. The companies I gravitate toward are the ones that look ridiculous to everyone else. SpaceX looked ridiculous. Crusoe mining Bitcoin on gas flares looked ridiculous. Construction estimation software powered by computer vision looks... sensible. Obvious, even. And obvious is where I lose interest, because obvious means the price of being right is already reflected in the competition. A solo founder at pre-seed going up against three or four companies with $20-30 million in the bank and established customer bases — that's not a fight where grit alone prevails. You need something structurally different.

The strongest bull case here lives in the permit data pipeline. This is the part of Scout Out that activates a pattern I've seen work: making invisible systems visible. Municipal permit data is fragmented across thousands of jurisdictions, locked in different databases with different formats, essentially opaque to the average small contractor. Scout Out is aggregating that data and connecting it directly to the estimation workflow — contractors discover the lead and bid on the job in one place. That's the Carta move: take something that existed in scattered spreadsheets and opaque filing systems and turn it into a transparent, accessible layer. If the permit data aggregation becomes comprehensive and reliable, it creates an operational moat that's genuinely hard to replicate, because it requires municipality-by-municipality engineering work that no AI model improvement can shortcut. Bundling lead generation with estimation is clever because it creates a workflow loop — contractors come for the leads and stay for the tool. If Nolan can build this data layer faster than the funded competitors can bolt one on, there's a real business here. The LA wildfire rebuilding surge gives him a concentrated market to prove it in, with thousands of homeowners simultaneously needing contractor bids. That timing is meaningful even if it's temporary.

But here's where I keep coming back to my core framework: I invest in people and my conviction about whether that person can solve this particular problem against these particular odds. Nolan has the domain knowledge and the technical credentials. What I don't have conviction about is whether a solo founder can simultaneously build a competitive computer vision pipeline, aggregate permit data across hundreds of municipalities, acquire and retain small contractor customers at $119 a month, and outrun companies with ten-to-fifty-times his resources — all at the same time. I learned from watching Crusoe Energy nearly die in 2020 that even brilliant founders with deeply differentiated ideas need support in crisis. Jonathan joined full-time. That's what it took. A solo team of one doesn't have that safety net. The economic access angle is real — small residential contractors are underserved by enterprise platforms like Procore, and giving them professional-grade estimation tools democratizes their ability to compete for work. That matters to me. But the combination of a consensus category, well-funded competition, and solo-founder execution risk means this doesn't trigger the conviction I need to write a check from my own money.
