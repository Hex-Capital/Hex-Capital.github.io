# Pollinate -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Two Australian college dropouts have pivoted twice in under two years — from a nightlife app connecting partygoers with clubs, to food wholesale supply chain, to ERP automation for US deep tech manufacturers. That trajectory tells me something. At 18, they spent their life savings to fly across Australia to talk to customers. That's the kind of irrational commitment I pay attention to. But the question I always ask first is not whether these founders are scrappy — it's whether the thing they're building, if it works perfectly, changes anything that matters at scale.

If Pollinate succeeds completely, supply chain teams at mid-market hardware manufacturers save 40% of their time on manual procurement tasks. Invoices get matched to POs automatically. Vendor management gets slightly less painful. ERPs work a little better. That is a real business. It is not a transformation of how supply chains operate. The AI Purchase Order Matching market is projected at $4.85 billion by 2029 — a perfectly decent market that Basware, with 6,500 customers and 40 years of history, already serves. Levelpath has raised $100 million to attack the same surface area with more capital and a broader platform. This is not a company that, at full success, makes the incumbent approach obsolete. It makes it slightly more tolerable. The consequence of success here is a solid mid-market SaaS company, and I have never written a check for "solid."

The strongest version of the bull case would go something like this: the ontology layer Pollinate is building on top of ERP systems becomes a universal data substrate for supply chain intelligence. Every manufacturer's messy, heterogeneous ERP data gets structured into a common representation, and AI agents operating on that substrate can orchestrate entire supply chains autonomously — not just matching invoices but predicting disruptions, rerouting procurement in real-time, and eventually replacing ERP systems entirely rather than sitting on top of them. If the ontology becomes the operating system for supply chain data the way Palantir's ontology became the operating system for government intelligence, the consequence magnitude explodes. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders are thinking at that scale. They're selling three-way match automation and invoice extraction. They're describing themselves as 80% out-of-the-box with 20% bespoke customization — which sounds like they're optimizing for deployment speed, not for building a new category. The ambition, as articulated, is calibrated to win customers, not to replace systems.

The technology itself does not clear my disruption threshold. Three-way match automation is well-understood. The dossier explicitly flags commoditization risk — Basware, Rossum, Itemize, Zimply, and Ovlo all offer AI-powered PO matching. The differentiator is an ontology layer that structures data across multiple ERPs, which is architecturally interesting but not the kind of 10x breakthrough that makes incumbents structurally uneconomic. When I backed Square, the insight was that every small business in America was locked out of card payments because POS infrastructure cost $1,000. Square made that cost zero. That is economic disruption. Pollinate is making ERP integration faster — days instead of quarters, they claim. Faster implementation is a sales advantage, not a structural moat.

On timing, they are riding a genuine wave. LLMs crossed a threshold in 2023-2024 that made reliable document extraction feasible for small teams, and the AI agent framework ecosystem is accelerating. That tailwind is real. But it's consensus — every B2B AI startup in this YC batch is riding the same curve. Being on the right curve matters, but being on a curve that everyone else is also on means you need extraordinary differentiation to win. The founders have shown real learning rate through their pivots and their willingness to relocate from Brisbane to San Francisco, but learning rate in the absence of contrarian conviction produces fast followers, not category creators. Nobody is telling these founders their idea is crazy. SAP is not mocking them. That absence of expert dismissal is, for me, a negative signal — it usually means the innovation is incremental enough to be non-threatening to incumbents.

I'll give the founders credit for one thing: they went and sat in manufacturing facilities. They delivered wholesale vegetables to restaurants. They earned their understanding of supply chain pain through physical contact with the problem, not through market research. That operational immersion is how the best founders build intuition. But operational immersion in a well-understood problem space with well-funded competitors is different from the kind of naive outsider conviction that built Rocket Lab or Impossible Foods. These founders know the problem exists. They don't yet appear to have a view of the world that makes their approach to solving it fundamentally different from what Levelpath, Ovlo, or any well-resourced team with LLM access could build.
