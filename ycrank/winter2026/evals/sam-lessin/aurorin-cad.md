# Aurorin CAD -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the core tension with Aurorin: the founder is building something genuinely hard, but the market thesis is something everyone already agrees with. Every mechanical engineer on the planet will tell you SolidWorks is a nightmare built on forty-year-old geometry kernels. "CAD needs to be rebuilt" is not a contrarian position -- it's a consensus complaint. When I look at the AI-CAD startup landscape and count Zoo with $10M raised, Adam AI with $4M, Hestus with $1.5M, and PTC bolting an AI Advisor onto Onshape, I see a category forming in real time. And when categories form, the non-consensus premium evaporates. The "insane" part of this bet isn't the thesis -- it's the execution ambition. A solo founder attempting to build a complete CAD kernel from scratch, which historically required dozens of engineers over many years. That's a different kind of insane, and honestly a less investable one for me. I want the world to think the founder is wrong about what they're building. I don't want the world to think the founder is wrong about whether one person can build it.

Michael Baron's credentials are genuinely impressive for this specific problem, and I want to be precise about that. Three SpaceX internships spanning propulsion simulation, Dragon GNC, and Starshield flight software. Apple GPU driver performance optimization. And the strongest signal: a four-year independent project building a multi-GPU graphics engine that rendered buildings and terrain at hundreds of FPS across multiple monitors. That's not a side project -- that's a demonstration of kernel-level systems engineering at exactly the abstraction layer a CAD kernel requires. The "sane" half of my equation is well-satisfied. Baron understands computational geometry, GPU parallelism, and physics simulation from hands-on experience, not from reading papers. If someone is going to solo-build a CAD kernel, this is the resume you'd design in a lab.

But when I run my AI kill test, Aurorin trips every wire. The pitch is literally "AI agent integrated into the kernel to automate repetitive design steps." AI isn't the cherry on top here -- AI IS the sundae. Strip out the AI component and you have a faster CAD tool, which is a feature improvement, not a new business. And the moat is pure software -- a custom kernel, which is technically complex but fundamentally code. My entire public thesis for the past eighteen months has been that software moats are dissolving because AI makes development cheaper and faster. The irony is acute: the same AI capability that makes Aurorin's product compelling also makes their moat more vulnerable over time. As AI-assisted software development improves, the multi-year head start of building a kernel from scratch compresses. The very force that creates the opportunity undermines the defensibility.

The bull case -- and I want to engage with it honestly because there's a real version of this that would excite me -- goes like this: CAD kernels are infrastructure primitives, not applications. Parasolid and ACIS are the two kernels that power virtually all professional CAD software, and they're licensed across the industry. If Baron built the AI-native Parasolid -- a kernel that other CAD tools, simulation engines, and manufacturing platforms built on -- that's a protocol-layer play with compounding network effects and exactly the kind of new primitive I spend my career looking for. A modern kernel that becomes the foundational layer for the next generation of design tools has genuine infinity optionality. But nothing in the dossier suggests Baron is thinking about this as a kernel licensing business. He's building an end-user desktop application with a chat interface. That's application-layer, not protocol-layer. And the inferred business model -- per-seat SaaS subscription -- is literally the business model I've been writing essays about killing. If Baron came to me and said "I'm building the next Parasolid and licensing it to every CAD company that wants AI-native geometry," I'd lean forward. What I see instead is another attempt to build the SolidWorks killer, which is a narrative that has absorbed and destroyed more venture capital than almost any other in enterprise software.

The SaaS pricing wrapper, the solo founder risk on a multi-year infrastructure project, the increasingly crowded competitive landscape, and the fundamental positioning of AI as the product rather than the accelerant -- these compound into a pass for me. Baron is talented and the market pain is real, but talent in a consensus category at consensus timing is exactly the configuration where I expect returns to disappoint. The painting company with the tech layer beats the tech company every time in my framework, and Aurorin is all tech, all the way down.
