# Tepali -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Tepali is the competitive dynamics problem. Boulevard raised $80M in Series D in July 2025 and explicitly cited the "Botox and GLP-1 surge" as the reason they're expanding into medspas with AI features. AestheticsPro is already an established medspa-specific platform with HIPAA-compliant charting and thousands of users. Zenoti has $174M in annual revenue serving enterprise wellness chains. This is not a market where incumbents are asleep -- it's a market where well-funded players are actively converging on the exact position Tepali wants to occupy. When Boulevard is spending $80M to build AI-native medspa features, Tepali's differentiation claim of being "AI-native" dissolves. The market that looks like a gap between horizontal salon software and enterprise wellness platforms is actually a gap that multiple funded companies are already rushing to fill.

The structural moment question is where this falls apart for me. What has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes medspa management software possible now? The dossier's "why now" is entirely inferred -- medspa industry growth at 16% CAGR, LLM capabilities reaching a threshold for natural language queries, GLP-1 medications driving demand. But medspa growth has been steady for years; it's a trend line, not an inflection point. And LLM-based querying across business data is becoming table stakes for every vertical SaaS company, not a capability threshold specific to medspas. When I invested ahead of a capability curve -- the way I did with Harvey in legal AI -- the key was that model fidelity had to cross a specific threshold before the use case was viable at all. Natural language queries on scheduling and CRM data don't require a threshold crossing; they require a competent integration layer that any well-resourced competitor can build.

The TAM tells a revealing story if you read it honestly. U.S. medspa management software is $118M, growing at 13.6% CAGR. That's a $250M market by 2030. Even if Tepali captured 20% of that -- an extremely aggressive assumption against entrenched competition -- that's $50M in revenue. That's a good business, but it's not venture-scale. The broader medical spa market is $21B, but Tepali captures value through software subscriptions, not through procedures. I look for markets that appear too small but reveal hidden scale when you map the adoption curve forward -- the way PagerDuty's "alerting for ops teams" became "operations infrastructure for every company running software." Medspa management software serves medspas. It doesn't naturally expand to serve a 10x larger adjacent population the way Gusto expanded from "payroll for startups" to "HR platform for every small business." The vertical is genuinely narrow.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that HIPAA compliance creates a durable barrier between salon software and medspa software (preventing Vagaro and Mangomint from moving upmarket), that Tepali can win SMB customers before Boulevard moves downmarket with vastly more resources, and that the all-in-one platform creates enough switching costs to lock in early adopters. If all three are true, this becomes a Gusto-like pattern -- own the operational layer for a specific employer type, then expand into payments, financing, and data-driven services. The fintech angle implied by Tepali's YC tags is interesting: embedded patient financing or payment processing could expand revenue per location significantly beyond SaaS subscriptions. And Chrisvin's time at Rilla -- a vertical AI SaaS company selling to fragmented SMBs -- is actually relevant operational experience for exactly this GTM motion. But "if three things are true" is the multi-miracle pattern I avoid. Each of those conditions is individually uncertain, and they compound.

On the founding team: Chrisvin Jabamani's background shows intellectual range -- investment banking at PJT Partners, operations at an AI startup, coding ability evidenced by GitHub repos -- but no direct medspa industry experience. The second co-founder is essentially invisible in public sources, which at a two-person company is a significant gap in my ability to assess team complementarity. The email domain mismatch (uselotus.ai versus tepali.com) and the "lotus-mcp" GitHub repo suggest a recent rename, which at pre-seed is fine but also indicates the medspa-specific thesis may be very new. The product is still in a "Get Early Access" phase with no public users, revenue, or prototype evidence. For a company entering a market with $80M-funded competitors, execution velocity will need to be exceptional -- and I don't see evidence of it yet.

I'm passing on this one. The market is consensus, not non-obvious -- when Boulevard raises $80M specifically for your market, the non-obvious window has closed. The TAM is genuinely small without a clear mechanism for it to be 10x larger than it appears. The AI differentiation is a feature layer, not a structural moat. And the competitive dynamics require Tepali to outrun well-funded incumbents who are building the same thing with 100x more resources. A smart scheduling interface on top of existing medspa workflows is useful, but it's a toaster with better software. I need to see that the company occupies a structural position that compounds -- and here, the position is being actively contested by players who got there first with far more capital.
