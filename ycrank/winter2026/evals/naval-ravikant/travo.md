# Travo -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is what's missing. Four Stanford CS undergrads -- EECS, AI, math -- with backgrounds in edtech, aerospace software, Roblox, and corporate law at Wachtell. Not one of them has spent a day in real estate. Not in brokerage, not in property management, not in real estate finance, not in any adjacent industry. They've chosen to build the definitive data platform for RV park investing, and there's no evidence any of them has ever underwritten an RV park, walked a campground, or sat across from a seller wondering whether the septic system passes code. The specific knowledge question answers itself: what does this team know about niche commercial real estate that a different group of smart Stanford engineers couldn't learn in three months of research? Nothing in the dossier suggests anything. This is the textbook case I warn against -- founders whose passion is for the startup opportunity, not for the domain itself.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. It goes like this: this isn't really a real estate company, it's a data engineering company. LLMs have crossed a capability threshold where you can extract structured information from county assessor records, zoning databases, and fragmented listing sites at a cost that was prohibitive two years ago. The RV park market is a wedge -- 90% of parks owned by operators with fewer than five properties means the data is genuinely fragmented and hard to assemble. If they build the most comprehensive dataset before anyone else bothers, the dataset itself becomes the moat. CoStar started as a data collection operation and became worth $30 billion. Maybe domain expertise is less important than engineering execution when the core problem is aggregation, not insight. And the "why now" is real: institutional capital is flowing into alternative asset classes as mainstream CRE yields compress, creating buyer demand for data that doesn't exist yet. If Travo nails RV parks and expands to mobile home parks, self-storage, marinas -- the TAM story changes.

But here's where the bull case breaks. CoStar's founders were embedded in commercial real estate. They understood not just what data to collect, but what data matters -- which fields drive underwriting decisions, which comps are relevant, what a buyer actually needs to close. Without that domain knowledge, you risk building a technically comprehensive database that's commercially irrelevant. You'll scrape every county record for every RV park in America and still not know whether your comp methodology makes sense to the PE firm writing the check. The leverage architecture is standard vertical SaaS -- software scales, yes, but the buyer pool is small. How many institutional investors are actively deploying capital into RV parks? A few hundred? The $10.9 billion total industry revenue number is misleading -- the addressable market for data services to investors in that segment is probably sub-$100 million, even with expansion to adjacent niche asset classes. This isn't creating a new form of leverage that didn't exist before. It's selling database access to a narrow audience.

The contrarian timing test fails in a specific way. Nobody is arguing against RV park data platforms -- the idea is simply too small for most investors and incumbents to have an opinion about. Being ignored is not the same as being contrarian. Uber was contrarian because smart people said ride-sharing was illegal and dangerous. Bitcoin was contrarian because smart people said it was worthless. "We're building better data for RV park investors" doesn't generate disagreement; it generates indifference. That indifference means there's no consensus to bet against, but it also means there's no asymmetric upside from a belief shift. If the market never attracts enough institutional attention, the data platform never reaches critical mass. If it does attract attention, well-funded incumbents like Altus (which acquired Reonomy for $200 million) or Cherre ($105 million raised) can build the coverage in a quarter.

The team has genuine technical talent -- ML research, satellite software, backend engineering at Roblox-scale -- and the CEO's prior education company exit shows he can build and sell something. These are capable engineers. But capable engineering applied to a domain you don't deeply understand, in a market that may be structurally too small, without a mechanism that creates new leverage -- that's a configuration I've seen many times. It usually produces a modest outcome, not a compounding one. I want founders where the knowledge gap between them and the next-best team is measured in years, not months. Here, I don't see that gap at all.
