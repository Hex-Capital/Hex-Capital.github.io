# Mendral -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that would normally get me excited: Sam Alba was Docker's literal first employee, Andrea Luzzardi architected Docker Swarm and worked on planetary-scale distributed systems at Google, and they've already co-founded one YC company together in Dagger. On paper, these are two of the most qualified people alive to build exactly this product. If I were evaluating founder-market fit purely on professional credentials, this would be near the top of the stack. But that's not how I evaluate, and credentials aren't what I'm looking for. When I sit down with a founder and say "tell me your story," I'm listening for the scar tissue -- the thing that happened to them that makes this problem *theirs* in a way no one else can claim. I hear two brilliant infrastructure engineers who saw a natural extension of the tools they've spent their careers building. That's a smart business observation. It's not a calling.

What really gives me pause, though, is that AI-powered DevOps tooling is about as consensus as it gets right now. Harness just raised at a $5.5 billion valuation with AI baked into their platform. Trunk.io has Andreessen backing. Every developer tool company on Earth is adding "AI agent" to their pitch. When I think about the investments that have defined my career -- writing the first check into SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, backing Uber when it was illegal, championing Contraline's male contraceptive gel while VCs laughed -- the common thread is that people thought I was wrong. Nobody thinks "AI agent that fixes broken CI/CD pipelines" is wrong. Everybody thinks it's obvious. And in my experience, when everybody agrees something is a good idea, the price is already wrong and the upside has been competed away. I don't feel that jolt of energy, that "magically weird" signal that something important is hiding inside something dismissed.

I also can't find the economic access thread I need to feel personally connected to an investment. Mendral saves engineering time at companies like PostHog and Inngest -- these are well-resourced tech teams where engineers earn six figures. Compare that to Uber creating income for hundreds of thousands of drivers who had no alternative, or Affirm replacing predatory credit card fees with transparent terms for people locked out of traditional finance. I look for companies that create real-world economic opportunity for people who need it, and a CI/CD optimization tool for software teams just doesn't activate that part of my investing brain, no matter how useful it is.

The strongest bull case I can construct: these founders have a decade-plus of shared work history, they know CI/CD pipeline failure modes at a molecular level, and the learning loop they describe -- where Mendral improves with every build across every customer -- could create a genuine data flywheel that makes the product increasingly difficult to replicate. Five paying customers including PostHog at pre-seed with SOC 2 Type II certification shows they're building for enterprise from day one. If GitHub doesn't move aggressively to integrate failure remediation into Actions natively, and if Mendral's accumulated pattern data across hundreds of codebases becomes genuinely proprietary, there's a path to owning this category. The Dagger-to-Mendral evolution could even mirror what happened with Crusoe -- founders whose original insight evolves with the technology landscape into something much bigger. But for that to work, I'd need clarity on the Dagger attention split (Sam's LinkedIn still lists Dagger as current), and I'd need to believe the learning loop creates durable defensibility rather than a head start that LLM improvements erode. The incumbency risk from GitHub integrating this directly into Copilot is the kind of platform dependency that keeps me up at night.

The co-founder relationship is genuinely the strongest signal here for my framework. EPITECH together, Docker together, Dagger together -- over a decade of building and shipping under real pressure. After HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect products die from founder conflict, I pay close attention to this, and Sam and Andrea have the kind of forged-in-fire partnership that survives hard times. That said, the unresolved question of their ongoing relationship to Dagger introduces exactly the kind of ambiguity I'd want to probe before writing a check. Are they fully committed, or is Mendral a side project that got interesting?

This is a well-built company by exceptional operators in a large and growing market. A lot of investors will fund it, and they might be right to. But it doesn't match the pattern I look for -- it's not unpopular, it's not weird, it doesn't create economic access for underserved people, and the founders' story, while impressive, is one of professional mastery rather than the kind of biographical grit that tells me someone will walk through walls for a decade. I respect the craft but I'm not the right investor for this one.
