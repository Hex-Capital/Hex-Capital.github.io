# Velum Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Velum Labs: this is a consensus market. AI security has already attracted hundreds of millions in venture capital -- Noma Security raised $132M with 1,300% ARR growth, Check Point bought Lakera, Veeam swallowed Securiti for its full stack. When I look at a deal and every major cybersecurity incumbent is already acquiring or building in the space, that's the opposite of the signal I trust. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. An "AI firewall" in early 2026 is neither unpopular nor difficult to assess -- it's exactly what every enterprise security buyer is asking for and every VC wants to fund. That doesn't mean it's a bad business. It means it's not my kind of bet. The price of being right here is low, and the penalty for being wrong against $132M-funded competitors is brutal.

When I try to understand the founders' biographical connection to this problem, I come up empty. Benjamin Muñoz-Cerro studied physics and math at Stanford with a focus on quantum computing. Alen Rubilar-Muñoz is a strong ML engineer -- CalHacks overall winner, principal engineer at Dataroot, deep learning research across multiple universities. Both are clearly technically capable. But when I ask my first question -- tell me your story, not the business -- I can't find the thread that connects these two people to enterprise data security. Where's the experience of watching sensitive patient data leak through an AI system? Where's the years spent inside a compliance team watching DLP tools fail? I spent nearly a decade in security operations at IronPort, and that lived experience is why I can evaluate security companies with conviction. These founders appear to be talented generalists who identified a hot market opportunity, built something technically interesting, and applied to YC. That's a perfectly rational thing to do. But it's not the biographical grit signal I need to write a check from my own money.

The product positioning concerns me in a way that feels like rehearsal rather than clarity. The website says "ontology engine for enterprise AI." The YC page says "open-source firewall for content-level access control." The blog says "dynamic data firewall for unstructured data." When a founder has lived inside a problem for years, they can describe it in one sentence that cuts through everything. This shifting framing suggests the team is still searching for their narrative, which is normal at pre-seed, but combined with claims of 50+ enterprise integrations and SOC 2 Type II compliance from a two-person team -- those claims make me uncomfortable. I don't care about perfect pitch decks, but I do care about authenticity. When claims outpace what's plausible for two people to have built, it raises the question of whether the polish is masking where the product actually is.

Let me give the strongest bull case its due, because I want to be fair. The acqui-hires of Lakera and Securiti genuinely may have opened a gap for a standalone, open-source content-level access control product. Nobody else is doing exactly this -- ontology-based semantic understanding of what data *means* across heterogeneous enterprise systems, not just regex pattern-matching for Social Security numbers. If Alen's "ontology" GitHub project represents real intellectual depth in this approach, it could be a technical differentiator that's hard to replicate quickly. And the timing is real: every enterprise deploying RAG or AI agents right now is terrified of data leakage, and traditional DLP was never designed for this. If this team can get three or four design partners in regulated industries, build genuine open-source community traction, and nail the positioning, there's a path to becoming the focused alternative to bloated incumbent platforms. For someone who invests on market timing and technical differentiation, this could be compelling.

But that's not how I invest. I invest in people solving problems that are inseparable from who they are, in spaces that look ridiculous to everyone else, building things that create real economic access for people who lack it. Velum is building enterprise security software for corporate compliance teams -- it doesn't create income for drivers or make opaque pricing transparent or connect skilled workers to opportunity. It protects corporate data from leaking, which is valuable but doesn't activate my thesis around positive-sum economic outcomes. And the space doesn't look ridiculous -- it looks like exactly where the smart money is already flowing. These are two capable young engineers entering a well-funded category without the biographical moat that would tell me they'll outlast competitors who have a hundred-times their capital. I wish them well, genuinely, but this isn't my check to write.
