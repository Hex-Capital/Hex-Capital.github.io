# ZeroSettle -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most revealing thing about ZeroSettle is what its competitors are doing. Paddle, valued at $1.4 billion with $293 million raised, partnered with RevenueCat last June to attack this exact opportunity. Appcharge has processed over $500 million in annual DTC transactions and just raised a $58 million Series B. Neon pulled $14 million from Thrive Capital and a16z. Stripe published iOS external payment documentation. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in public telecom was impossible -- the incumbents dismissed it. Here, every well-resourced player in the payments ecosystem is validating the approach and racing to build it. When the experts agree with you, you're not inventing a new category. You're competing for market share in a category someone else already defined.

Let me start where I always start: if ZeroSettle succeeds completely, what changes? iOS developers keep more of their revenue -- they pay ZeroSettle 5% instead of Apple 30%. That's a real savings. It's also a fee optimization within an existing payment flow, not a transformation of how any industry operates. The App Store still exists. Users still buy subscriptions the same way. The only difference is where the processing fee lands. Compare this to what I look for: Impossible Foods succeeding means billions of acres of land reclaimed. Commonwealth Fusion succeeding means fossil fuels become obsolete. Square succeeding meant millions of merchants who couldn't accept electronic payments suddenly could -- it expanded the market. ZeroSettle succeeding means a wealth transfer from Apple's balance sheet to app developers' balance sheets, intermediated by yet another payment processor. The consequence of that success is a business, not a transformation. I have a visceral reaction to startups whose maximum ambition is to be a toll collector on someone else's platform, and that reaction applies here.

The founders are classic insiders. Both Ryan Elliott and Gabe Roeloffs are ex-Apple systems engineers who know StoreKit, App Store guidelines, and iOS internals intimately. Their domain expertise is genuine and directly relevant -- but this is precisely the pattern I've learned to be skeptical of. They've taken their knowledge of Apple's system and built a tool to navigate around its edges. They're not asking "what if the entire model of app distribution is wrong?" They're asking "how do we help developers route around a 30% fee?" That's engineering competence applied to an incremental problem. I don't see evidence of contrarian courage -- avoiding App Store fees is the most consensus opinion in the developer community. Nobody disagrees with this thesis. And when nobody disagrees, the upside is capped by competition, not by imagination.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Someone will win this market. The regulatory opening is real -- the Epic v. Apple ruling and the EU DMA created a product category that literally didn't exist before April 2025. ZeroSettle's integrated approach (single SDK, full MoR, pre-built paywalls, subscriber migration tools) is genuinely more elegant than bolting Paddle and RevenueCat together across two vendor integrations. The founders' Apple engineering backgrounds give them platform-specific insight that Paddle's team doesn't have. If the regulatory environment stabilizes, if Apple doesn't find new ways to restrict external payments, and if ZeroSettle moves fast enough to lock in developer relationships before Paddle and Appcharge's sales teams scale up -- this could become a meaningful payments business worth hundreds of millions. The timing element is the strongest card they hold: they're building specifically for a March 2026 compliance deadline with a shipping SDK while some competitors are still announcing partnerships. In a land grab, speed matters.

But that bull case also reveals the fragility. The December 2025 appeals court ruling -- that Apple should be able to charge a "reasonable commission" on external purchases -- could collapse the entire value proposition. ZeroSettle's savings math depends on the spread between Apple's 30% and ZeroSettle's 5%. If Apple successfully imposes a 20% commission on externally linked transactions (as they've done in the EU), the developer's net savings shrinks to roughly 5 percentage points, and the switching cost of managing a second payment integration may not justify that marginal improvement. This isn't a technology risk I can evaluate with a rate-of-change framework -- it's a regulatory risk that depends on the decisions of individual judges and bureaucrats. I can't model judicial behavior the way I can model the trajectory of AI model improvement or protein engineering capability.

The technology itself is operational infrastructure -- tax compliance across 190 jurisdictions, chargeback management, fraud detection, jurisdiction-specific checkout rendering. This is genuinely hard to build, but it's the same hard that Paddle, FastSpring, and Lemon Squeezy have already built for digital products generally. ZeroSettle's iOS-specific adaptation of this infrastructure is an application of existing MoR patterns, not a structural breakthrough. Nothing here makes the incumbent approach economically unviable -- it makes an alternative approach marginally available. The cryptocurrency and escrow components mentioned in their GitHub repos add positioning confusion without obvious strategic value.

This is a well-executed product in a real market built by competent engineers. It's also exactly the kind of bet I pass on. The consequence of success is a payment processing business competing against players with $400 million more in funding. The founders are insiders optimizing an insider's system. The technology is operational complexity, not disruption. And the entire thesis rests on a regulatory foundation that is actively being contested in court. These founders are too capable to spend their careers fighting over payment processing margins on someone else's platform. The problem they should be working on is bigger than this.
