# Corvera -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Corvera is the company I describe when people ask me what I mean by "a tech company with a paint layer." An AI-native operational SaaS for CPG supply chains is precisely the category where founders look brilliant for eighteen months and then discover that every incumbent with distribution shipped the same capabilities as a feature update. The dossier itself contains the indictment: "the underlying AI capabilities (LLM-based document parsing, time-series forecasting, workflow automation) are increasingly commoditized." The company's own risk section identifies the exact structural problem I'd flag. When Cin7 -- already doing $35-75M in annual revenue with an installed CPG customer base -- bolts on an agentic layer, or when Settle adds forecasting to its financial platform, Corvera is fighting entrenched distribution with the one asset (AI model capability) that depreciates fastest. This isn't a contrarian observation. It's the consensus view stated plainly.

The founder story has genuine merit, and I want to give it proper weight because Christopher Kong is not some random technical founder guessing at CPG pain. He ran Better Nature through nationwide UK retail distribution -- Tesco, Asda, Ocado, Whole Foods. He lived inside the exact operational chaos Corvera automates. That's real. Breeuwer built multi-agent systems at Google. Collins has a Princeton CS background and product leadership experience. These are competent, credible people. But here's the problem with my framework: "sane person, insane idea" requires both halves. The sane part checks out. The insane part doesn't. "AI agents for supply chain operations" is the single most consensus B2B AI thesis in 2026. The dossier cites McKinsey finding 71% of CPG leaders already integrating AI, and NVIDIA reporting 9 in 10 retailers increasing AI budgets with agentic AI as a focus area. When McKinsey and NVIDIA are telling every CPG executive to do exactly what your startup does, you are not operating in non-consensus territory. You're competing for a prize that everyone already knows exists.

My core test -- would this business be compelling if AI didn't exist? -- produces a clear answer: no. Strip the AI layer away and Corvera is a supply chain dashboard. Cin7 already does that. Settle already does pieces of it. The entire value proposition IS the autonomous agent execution. That means the moat IS the AI capability, and AI capability is the fastest-depreciating asset in technology right now. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is physical -- painting crews, scheduling logistics, quality control across thousands of jobs. AI makes Craftwork's dispatch better but can't replace the painters. With Corvera, AI doesn't amplify an existing operational advantage. AI IS the operation. That's the structural configuration I'm most bearish on.

The bull case deserves engagement: if Corvera achieves deep integration across a brand's entire workflow -- orders, inventory, forecasting, POs, invoicing, logistics -- the switching costs become meaningful. A brand running its entire operations through Corvera won't casually migrate to a competitor. That's real. And Kong's CPG network gives him a distribution edge for the first twenty or thirty customers that a horizontal AI startup wouldn't have. If you believe vertical depth creates a data flywheel -- cross-brand demand patterns, category-specific forecasting models, retailer-specific order format parsing -- then there's a version of this where Corvera becomes genuinely embedded infrastructure for mid-market CPG. The 15 design partners and 50+ brand pipeline suggest early pull. But I've seen this movie before. Birchbox had early pull too. The question isn't whether the first customers love it -- it's whether the structural moat holds when well-funded competitors show up with equivalent AI and better distribution. Software switching costs are exactly the kind of moat that erodes fastest in an AI-native world, because a better agent can learn your workflows faster than a human team could migrate them.

There's no primitive being created here. Corvera isn't establishing a new layer that other companies build on. It's an application sitting on top of existing retail, warehouse, and logistics infrastructure. Other companies' products don't improve when Corvera succeeds -- which is the hallmark test for protocol-layer positioning. The narrative could theoretically expand from "CPG operations" to "autonomous operations for all commerce," but that expansion immediately puts you in competition with SAP, Oracle, and every enterprise software company on the planet, which is exactly where you don't want to be as a four-person startup. The narrative elasticity runs into a wall of incumbents who are better capitalized and already have the customer relationships.

I respect Kong's operator pedigree and the team's technical credentials. In a different structural configuration -- if they were building physical CPG infrastructure with a software layer, or if they were creating a new data standard for retail order processing that became an industry primitive -- I'd score this very differently. But as constructed, Corvera is an AI-first SaaS company in a consensus category with software-only moats. That's three of my strongest avoidance signals stacked on top of each other. Pass.
