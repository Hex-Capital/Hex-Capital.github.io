# Salus -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells you everything you need to know about whether a secret exists. Galileo has raised $68 million. Fiddler has raised roughly $100 million. Patronus has $40 million. NVIDIA ships an open-source guardrails framework with 5,600 GitHub stars. OpenAI's own Agents SDK documentation includes a guardrails section. And Gartner -- the ultimate arbiter of consensus -- has already named this the "guardian agent" category and predicted it will capture 15% of the AI market within four years. When Gartner has taxonomized your category before you have a single public customer, you do not have a secret. You have a consensus dressed in infrastructure clothing. The thesis that "AI agents need runtime safety checks before executing actions" is something literally every intelligent person in the industry agrees with. It is as contrarian as saying "databases should have backups." The question I always ask -- what important truth do very few people agree with you on? -- has no answer here that I can identify. The insight is universal, and universality is the death of monopoly.

The structural dynamics are worse than mere consensus. Salus sits as middleware between the agent framework (LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI SDK) and the tool call -- a thin interception layer that checks policies before execution. The dossier's own analysis concedes the point plainly: "The core concept -- intercepting tool calls and checking them against policies -- is architecturally straightforward. Any observability or agent framework vendor with SDK-level access to tool calls could build similar functionality." This is the middleware trap in its purest form. When Stripe created developer-first payments, it was building a fundamentally different abstraction that banks and payment processors couldn't replicate without rethinking their entire architecture. When Salus adds a `@session.protect()` decorator, it is adding a feature that the platform vendor can absorb with a quarter's worth of engineering. OpenAI is already signaling this intent. Anthropic could do it tomorrow. The company is building on ground that belongs to someone else.

The strongest bull case deserves genuine engagement. The argument would be: as agents proliferate, the "permit/deny" decision point before every consequential action becomes critical infrastructure, and the company that accumulates the most data about agent failure modes builds a proprietary understanding that no competitor can replicate. The 58% blocked-action recovery rate -- where the agent self-corrects after receiving structured feedback about why its action was rejected -- is genuinely interesting. If this feedback loop creates compounding intelligence about how agents fail and how to redirect them, Salus could become the Cloudflare of agent actions: a thin layer that becomes indispensable through accumulated intelligence. The problem with this analogy is that Cloudflare's moat deepened through network effects -- more traffic produced better threat intelligence, and a global edge network created economies of scale that no startup could replicate. Salus's validation logic doesn't obviously benefit from cross-customer network effects. Each customer's policies are independent. A refund-processing agent's failure modes at Company A don't necessarily improve the guardrails for an email-sending agent at Company B. Without that compounding dynamic, the data moat never materializes, and you are left with a feature, not a company.

Both founders are current Stanford undergraduates -- Vedant Singh a junior, Kevin Pan's year unclear. Singh's research breadth is genuinely impressive: multiple Stanford AI labs, MIT RSI, an International Linguistics Olympiad medal, multi-agent systems projects. These are smart, technically capable people. But I see no evidence of the kind of singular, obsessive conviction that defines the founders I back. No refused acquisition, no refusal to pivot, no articulated vision of how the world is different in twenty years if Salus succeeds. The CryptoAgents project and research across six different labs suggests intellectual breadth rather than the monomaniacal depth I associate with founders who build monopolies. More critically, they are two undergraduates entering a market where their competitors have $68 million and $100 million in funding, enterprise sales teams, and Fortune 50 customers. Enterprise infrastructure sales requires production reliability guarantees, SLAs, and the organizational credibility to convince a VP of Engineering to put a synchronous, latency-sensitive middleware layer in the critical path of every agent action. That is a hard sell for any startup; for two college students without a visible track record of shipping production infrastructure, it is an extraordinarily difficult one.

The technology itself is a 1-to-n improvement, not a 0-to-1 discontinuity. Checking a tool call against a YAML policy before execution is useful engineering. It is not a capability that didn't exist before, and it is not ten times better than what a competent engineering team could build internally in a sprint. The benchmarks -- 52% misalignment reduction, 60% lower cost -- are incremental gains, not the order-of-magnitude leaps that create structural barriers. When your technology can be described as "we intercept the function call and check it against rules," you have described something that any agent framework could implement as a built-in feature. This is precisely the category I avoid: the underlying technology is straightforward, the innovation is in the integration pattern rather than in any proprietary capability, and the competitive moat depends on adoption momentum rather than on doing something that competitors structurally cannot do.

I pass. The market will exist -- agents will need guardrails, and someone will build them. But the "someone" is most likely the platform vendors themselves (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) or the well-funded companies that have already built broader AI infrastructure platforms around evaluation and observability. A two-person pre-seed startup with no visible customers, no proprietary technology barrier, and a maximally consensus thesis is not positioned to become the last mover in this space. The power law demands that I invest only in companies where the outcome, if everything goes right, is a durable monopoly worth returning the entire fund. Salus, even in its best case, looks like a useful feature that gets absorbed -- not a company that dominates a category for decades.
