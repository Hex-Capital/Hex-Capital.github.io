# Velum Labs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's a company building AI-powered software to protect enterprises from the risks of AI-powered software. I want you to sit with that circularity for a moment, because it tells you everything about why this doesn't work for me. If AI didn't exist, Velum wouldn't exist. That's the inverse of my "cherry on top" filter -- this isn't a great business that AI makes better, it's a business that IS AI, for AI. And the core capabilities the dossier describes -- NLP-based data detection, policy-based redaction, tokenization -- are explicitly called out as "individually reproducible using commodity ML models and existing PII detection libraries." When the dossier itself is making my argument for me, I don't need to work very hard.

The sane-person-insane-idea calibration fails on the idea side, not the founder side. These are clearly smart, technically capable people -- Alen Rubilar-Mu?oz's ML research across Vanderbilt and Leipzig, his CalHacks win, and his pinned GitHub "ontology" repo show someone who's been thinking about structured data problems with real depth. Benjamin's Stanford physics background provides quantitative rigor. But "AI security for enterprises" is not an insane idea in 2026. It's one of the most consensus categories in enterprise software. Noma just raised $132 million. Check Point acquired Lakera. Veeam acquired Securiti. Every enterprise CISO in the world is looking for this. When every VC wants to fund AI security and every buyer wants to buy it, the non-consensus premium has been completely arbitraged away. You're buying narrative at market price against competitors with 100-300x your capital.

The moat question is where this really breaks down for me. Look at what happened to Lakera and Securiti -- both acquired, both absorbed as features into larger platforms. That's not an anomaly, that's the structural pattern. Content-level access control and data redaction are feature-weight capabilities that belong inside broader security or cloud platforms, not standalone businesses. Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS all have DLP tools today; extending them to semantic-level understanding across AI workflows is an incremental engineering problem, not a fundamental architectural barrier. The dossier's claim that this would require "a fundamental architectural change" for incumbents doesn't hold -- these are the same companies building the frontier LLMs that do semantic understanding natively. The fire department doesn't need to buy a separate hose company when they already manufacture the truck.

The most intellectually honest bull case goes something like this: Velum's ontology engine becomes a new semantic standard for how enterprises define and enforce data permissions -- a primitive, not a product. If the ontology layer becomes infrastructure that every AI system routes through, analogous to how Kubernetes became the standard for container orchestration, then you have a protocol-layer investment with compounding network effects. The open-source positioning could catalyze this. The acqui-hires of Lakera and Securiti removed two standalone competitors and left a gap for an independent, focused player. And the regulatory pressure (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA enforcement around AI-mediated data processing) creates demand that can't be ignored. For this to work, you'd need the ontology approach to gain genuine community adoption, for the founders to establish this as a standard rather than a product, and for the market to reward independence over integration. I don't see evidence of any of these three conditions materializing -- no visible open-source community, confused positioning across "ontology engine," "firewall," and "dynamic data firewall," and a 2-person team claiming 50+ enterprise integrations and SOC 2 Type II certification that strain credulity.

What only I would notice here is the positioning confusion as a fatal signal. Companies that are genuinely building new primitives know exactly what they are -- Venmo was peer-to-peer payments, Helium was decentralized wireless, Aleo was zero-knowledge privacy. Each had a one-sentence identity that was crystalline. Velum is simultaneously an "ontology engine for enterprise AI," an "open-source firewall for content-level access control," and a "dynamic data firewall for unstructured data." That's three different companies. When a pre-seed startup can't decide whether it's infrastructure or a security product, it's usually neither -- it's a feature searching for a category. The Birchbox lesson applies in modified form here: narrative magnitude without structural moat produces the worst venture outcome. Velum has narrative magnitude (data security for the AI era!) but the moat is pure software, in a market where bigger software companies are already consolidating the category through acquisition.
