# 10x Science -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question is always the same: what is the secret? What does this company believe about the world that most intelligent people would argue against? The implicit thesis here is that AI-designed protein therapeutics are flooding biopharma pipelines faster than existing characterization tools can process them, and that instrument vendors like Thermo Fisher and Waters are structurally unable to solve this because instrument-agnostic AI software would cannibalize their hardware bundling business models. The structural conflict is real and interesting -- it's the kind of market-architecture observation that can create an opening. But I struggle to call it a secret in the sense that matters. "AI can automate analytical chemistry workflows" is not a thesis that most smart people in biopharma actively reject. It is, at best, a timing insight -- the observation that AI-generated drug candidates are creating a demand-side shock to characterization capacity right now. Timing insights can create valuable companies, but they are not the same as contrarian truths that restructure your understanding of a market. Nobody at Thermo Fisher is arguing that AI won't eventually transform mass spectrometry analysis. They're arguing about when and how, and whether to build it themselves or acquire it. That is competitive dynamics, not a monopoly-creating secret.

The team is the strongest signal here, and it's genuinely unusual. Two scientists from Carolyn Bertozzi's Nobel Prize-winning lab at Stanford, combined with a CTO who was a founding engineer at Nooks through its $43 million Series B. Roberts has 50+ publications in *Nature*, *JACS*, and *PNAS*, two U.S. patents, and a Damon Runyon Fellowship. Reiter comes from the Broad Institute's proteomics platform -- one of the premier mass spectrometry facilities in the world. This is the kind of domain depth I respect. When I co-founded Palantir, the founding insight was that PayPal's fraud algorithms could be adapted for intelligence work -- it required people who had built those specific algorithms, not general-purpose engineers. Similarly, building AI models that interpret mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns for protein characterization requires scientists who have spent years generating and interpreting that data. Pure software teams cannot replicate this. The question is whether domain depth alone constitutes a monopoly -- and the answer is that it does not. It is a necessary condition, not a sufficient one.

The power-law concern is where this investment breaks for me. Even under optimistic assumptions, the software-only segment of the protein characterization market is likely well under a billion dollars annually. The broader TAM figures cited -- $2.6 billion to $18 billion -- include instruments, reagents, and services, not just software. A software company that achieves complete monopoly in a $500 million market is a good business, perhaps a very good business, but it is not the kind of company that can return a fund. Stripe could return a fund because payment processing touches trillions of dollars in commerce. Palantir could return a fund because intelligence analysis is a civilizational-scale problem with unlimited government budgets. An analytical software tool for biopharma peptide mapping, however excellent, has a ceiling. The company's name -- 10x Science -- suggests they believe they can be 10x better, but even if true, 10x superiority in a constrained market produces a modest outcome, not a power-law outcome.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If 10x Science can build an AI platform that becomes the default analytical engine for all protein characterization -- not just peptide mapping but intact mass analysis, glycan profiling, host cell protein quantitation, and eventually all biologics analytical workflows -- the market expands meaningfully. If AI-designed therapeutics truly create an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of drug candidates requiring characterization, the demand curve shifts dramatically. If the platform accumulates proprietary training data from biopharma customers and creates a flywheel where every new dataset makes the models more accurate, switching costs compound over time. If the company embeds itself in GxP-compliant regulatory submission workflows, it becomes structurally irreplaceable -- the Palantir pattern applied to drug development. And if the instrument-vendor structural conflict genuinely prevents Thermo Fisher and Waters from building a competing instrument-agnostic solution, the competitive moat deepens. Under this scenario, 10x Science becomes the operating system for biologics characterization -- a category-defining platform rather than a point solution. That is a real possibility, and the team has the scientific credibility to pursue it.

But possibility is not probability, and the evidence available does not resolve the critical uncertainties. There is no demonstrated product, no revenue, no LOIs, no prototype usage data, and no articulated vision beyond the category description on the YC page. I cannot assess whether the founders have a definite plan for how they dominate this market or whether they are iterating toward product-market fit. The "2x YC Founder" claim that cannot be verified in public records is a minor but genuine concern -- I care about precision in self-representation. The brand confusion with 10x Genomics (NASDAQ: TXG) in an adjacent biopharma space is a tactical problem that suggests insufficient strategic forethought about market positioning. And Dotmatics, with 200+ biopharma customers already using Protein Metrics Byonic, has the installed base and customer relationships to add AI features incrementally -- the classic fast-follower response that erodes first-mover advantages in software. The founders have extraordinary scientific credentials. They are building in a real, if narrow, market with genuine pain points. But I do not see the contrarian secret, the monopoly path, or the power-law potential that my framework requires. This is a competent team pursuing a consensus opportunity in a constrained market.
