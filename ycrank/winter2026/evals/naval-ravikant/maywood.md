# Maywood -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the competitive landscape, not the team. Datasite acquired Grata for $200M and Blueflame AI within six months of each other in 2025, with $500M committed from CapVest to expand. OffDeal raised $17M. F2 AI raised $10M. When an incumbent with $158M in revenue and 1,400 employees is actively consolidating your category through acquisitions, you are not in a contrarian position -- you are in a race against a well-capitalized consolidator who already has distribution to your target customers. "AI for M&A" in 2026 is not a secret. It's a PowerPoint slide that every fintech pitch deck has already presented. The consensus is in, and the consensus is right that LLMs can generate financial documents. The question is just who captures the value, and that question favors the company that already sits inside the bank's data room.

On specific knowledge: Drake Goodman was an investor at Blackstone who helped roll out AI initiatives. Kent Goodman did automation work at BCG. These are legitimate professional exposures, but they are institutional knowledge -- the kind that is, by definition, taught and trained. Thousands of Blackstone analysts have experienced the same deal execution tedium. Any two smart Wharton and MIT graduates who spent time in PE and consulting could identify the same workflow gaps. I don't see evidence of the kind of non-transferable domain obsession that distinguishes a founder who must build this company from one who could build it. The insight -- "bankers waste time on repetitive document production" -- is observable by anyone who has worked a single M&A deal. Compare this to what drew me to Stack Overflow: the founders had lived inside the developer knowledge problem for years and understood something structural about how programmers learn that no outsider could replicate. Here, the domain knowledge is real but shallow -- it's professional exposure, not a decade of obsessive inquiry into how deal execution actually works at the information-theoretic level.

The strongest signal is the CTO, Esteban Vizcaino. An ICML 2024 publication on solving PDEs with deep neural nets is genuine research depth -- that's not trainable in a bootcamp. His experience applying ML at Balyasny adds a second data point. This gives me confidence that the technical execution is real, and the SOC 2 Type II certification at pre-seed is impressive operational discipline that most startups don't achieve until Series A. But the research expertise is somewhat orthogonal to the actual product -- generating CIMs and pitch decks is a document synthesis problem, not a differential equations problem. The technical skill is real but misaligned with the core product challenge.

The leverage architecture concerns me most. Maywood makes existing investment bankers more efficient -- the testimonial claims "doubling capacity." That's valuable, but it's not creating a new form of leverage. It's not enabling a new type of person to execute M&A deals. It's not building a protocol that compounds. Compare to OffDeal, which is actually attempting something structurally more interesting -- an AI-native investment bank that replaces the traditional model entirely. That's leverage creation. Maywood is productivity enhancement sold to incumbents, which means long enterprise sales cycles, concentrated buyer power, and a business that scales with your sales team's headcount, not with code. Each new bank requires integration work, customization to firm-specific formatting, and enterprise procurement navigation. The software itself has code leverage, but the go-to-market is fundamentally linear.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. Investment banking generates some of the highest revenue-per-employee of any industry. If Maywood genuinely doubles a bank's deal throughput, the value per deployment could be extraordinary -- potentially millions per customer per year, justifying enterprise pricing that creates a very capital-efficient business. The firm-specific data integration creates real switching costs once deployed. The founders have the right institutional pedigree to get meetings with bank CIOs. And if Datasite is buying rather than building AI capabilities, there's an acquisition path at meaningful valuations -- Blueflame was reportedly acquired at a $50M valuation after only a $5M Series A. But building for acquisition is exactly the kind of short-term orientation I avoid. And the switching-cost moat is weaker than it appears: it depends on the bank choosing Maywood before Datasite integrates similar capabilities into the platform they already use.

This is a competent team building a useful tool in a real market. But from my framework, it fails the tests that matter most. The founders' knowledge is institutional, not specific. The leverage is incremental, not categorical. The timing is consensus, not contrarian. The technology doesn't compound in a way that creates a widening moat -- it's an application of general-purpose LLMs to a vertical domain, and the dossier itself acknowledges the core technology "is replicable by well-funded competitors." I want to back founders who know something that can't be taught, building leverage that didn't exist before, at a moment when informed people think they're wrong. Maywood has none of these three properties. Pass.
