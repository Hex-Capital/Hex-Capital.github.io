# Mantis Biotechnology -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The most striking feature of Mantis isn't its technology or market -- it's the Louiza Labs situation. Georgia Witchel co-founded Louiza Labs in YC S25, built a "physics engine for simulated human biology" for digital twins and autonomous surgical robotics, raised over $5 million, and then six months later founded Mantis Biotechnology in YC W26 doing what appears to be the same thing under a different name with a different team. Same YC partner (Gustaf Alstromer). Same domain. Back-to-back batches. I've seen founders iterate and pivot, but this pattern -- departing from a funded company you co-founded to start a near-identical company in the next YC cohort -- raises questions I can't answer from public information. Is the IP clean? Is Louiza Labs still operating? What happened to those investors? This isn't disqualifying, but it triggers my "fundraising optimizer" antenna. The founder who cycles through institutional programs accumulating checks without building durably is exactly the anti-pattern my "rizz and tizz" framework is designed to catch. Witchel might have excellent reasons for the transition, but from the outside it looks like someone optimizing for YC as a repeatable fundraising mechanism rather than grinding on a single hard problem.

Setting the corporate structure question aside and running my sane-person-insane-idea filter: Witchel is credibly sane for this problem. Harvey Mudd CS, UW bioengineering master's, elite ice climber who broke eight world records, prior company in the exact domain. That's a genuinely cross-disciplinary technical founder with direct experience building the thing she says she's building. The "sane" calibration is solid. The problem is the "insane" side of the equation. Building a data infrastructure layer for biomedical digital twins is not an insane idea -- it's a consensus idea with a well-established market map. Unlearn.AI has $135 million. Twin Health has $301 million. Quibim has $70 million. Dassault Systèmes has been running the Living Heart Project for eight years. The TAM projections in this dossier are the kind of numbers that make every generalist VC nod approvingly. When every investor thinks the market is big and the timing is right, you're buying narrative at market price. The non-consensus premium has been arbitraged away.

Now here's where I apply the kill test that matters most to me: does AI commoditize this business or strengthen it? A "domain-aware data platform" that encodes biological meaning into reusable datasets is software. It's specialized software, and the specialization gives it some runway, but the trajectory is clear. LLMs are already capable of understanding biomedical data formats, clinical standards, and cross-modal data relationships. The mapping between heterogeneous biomedical data formats and biologically meaningful representations -- which is the core of what Mantis claims to do -- is precisely the kind of structured translation task that AI models improve at exponentially. Within two years, a well-prompted foundation model with the right biomedical training data could replicate much of this normalization layer. The "domain encoding" moat is a software moat, and software moats are dissolving. There's no physical infrastructure here, no installed hardware, no operational complexity that a competitor can't replicate with cheaper software. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is painting crews and scheduling logistics -- you can't AI your way into having trucks and trained painters. Mantis has none of that friction.

The strongest bull case, and I want to be honest about it, runs through my Airtable exception. If Mantis establishes itself as the standard encoding schema for biomedical simulation data -- if it becomes the primitive that pharma companies, device manufacturers, and sports performance organizations all build on -- then it transcends the SaaS category and becomes protocol-layer infrastructure with compounding network effects. The competitors are all vertical (clinical trials, imaging, metabolic health). Nobody is building the horizontal unification layer. If Mantis nails that position, every vertical digital twin company becomes a customer rather than a competitor. That's genuine infinity optionality -- from sports to clinical trials to drug development to personalized medicine. The narrative can expand without limit. But the Airtable exception required something Mantis doesn't have: demonstrated organic adoption and product-market fit. When I backed Airtable, people were already using it compulsively, building workflows on it, unable to imagine going back. Mantis has a website that displays a header and nothing else. No product pages, no pricing, no documentation, no customer evidence. The primitive potential exists in theory but I see zero evidence of it materializing in practice.

The revenue and traction picture reinforces my hesitation. Zero public customers, zero public revenue, zero demonstrated usage, zero job postings, an essentially blank website. At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of scale, but I do look for any signal of demand validation -- a signed LOI, a pilot with a named institution, even a waitlist with real names. The dossier contains none. The company's own marketing infrastructure (no Twitter, minimal web presence, no Product Hunt) suggests a team that hasn't yet engaged with its market in a visible way. My "downside cushion" test finds nothing to cushion against.

I keep coming back to the fundamental structural question: is this a new primitive or just another application? The honest answer is I don't know, and neither does anyone else, because there's nothing to evaluate beyond the narrative. A credible founder in a consensus market with a software-based moat, no traction, and corporate history that raises more questions than it answers. If the Louiza Labs situation resolves cleanly and Mantis demonstrates that it's building a genuine data standard rather than a data tool, I'd want another look. But today this is a sane person with a sane idea, and those bets don't produce the returns I need.
