# General Legal -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The CTO of this company built Casetext and sold it to Thomson Reuters for $650 million in cash. That's not a credential you can fake or inflate. Ryan Walker, J.P. Mohler, and Javed Qadrud-Din collectively represent one of the most credible teams I've seen at any YC demo day -- Harvard Law JDs who practiced at Cooley and Fenwick, deep NLP research published in academic venues, and a genuine nine-figure exit in the exact domain they're now re-entering. On the "sane" axis, this registers as loud as it gets. But I've learned the hard way that founder quality alone doesn't make an investment. The question is whether the idea is insane enough -- whether this team is wasting their exceptional talent on something too obvious.

And that's where my framework breaks down on General Legal. An AI-accelerated law firm offering flat-fee contract review is not an insane idea. It's the most predictable idea in legal tech right now. Lawhive just raised $60 million doing a version of this in the UK and is expanding to the U.S. Harvey has $190 million in ARR selling AI tools to the firms that would otherwise be doing this work. Multiple batchmates in YC W26 are running similar AI-native law firm models. When the Artificial Lawyer is categorizing your business model as a "NewMod" archetype alongside several others, the non-consensus premium has been arbitraged away. The best deals I've done -- Solana at five cents, Venmo when nobody thought mobile payments mattered -- involved founders where other investors questioned their sanity. Nobody questions whether AI will transform legal services. Everyone already knows this. These are sane founders pursuing a sane idea, which in my framework means the upside is already priced into the market.

The structural moat question cuts even deeper, and this is where I'd push back if someone told me "but it's a law firm, not a SaaS company -- the regulatory barrier IS the moat." That argument sounds like my Craftwork thesis: physical operations that software amplifies but can't replace. But the analogy doesn't hold. Craftwork's moat is that you need actual humans climbing actual ladders with actual paint -- AI can optimize dispatch but it cannot paint a house. General Legal's operational barrier is bar licensure and malpractice coverage, which are real but thin. Any attorney can pass the bar. Any attorney can adopt the same broadly available LLMs for contract review. The dossier itself states this plainly: "The underlying LLM capabilities used for contract review are broadly accessible." When I ask my core question -- does this business get stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper? -- the answer is unambiguously weaker. Every improvement in LLM capability that makes General Legal 10x efficient also makes every other attorney 10x efficient. The AI isn't a cherry on top of an already-defensible business; the AI IS the business model. Remove it, and $500 flat-fee contracts with one-hour turnaround become economically impossible.

Here's the bull case I want to genuinely engage with: maybe the Casetext team has proprietary workflow knowledge that matters more than the underlying models. Years of building legal AI produced institutional knowledge about prompt engineering for legal text, about error patterns in contract review, about how to structure human-AI collaboration for attorney sign-off. Maybe that accumulated expertise creates a 12-24 month lead over competitors who are just strapping GPT-4 onto a Google Doc. And maybe the founder network -- Cooley, Fenwick, YC, Thomson Reuters relationships -- creates distribution advantages that turn early clients into compounding word-of-mouth in the startup ecosystem. If General Legal can capture a meaningful share of growth-stage commercial contracting before competitors scale, the switching costs of a trusted law firm relationship could provide stickiness that software tools don't. The 20+ companies who moved their commercial contracting during private preview suggest the value proposition resonates immediately. If this team executes with the operational intensity they demonstrated at Casetext, they could build a real business here -- just not the kind of business I want to own.

Because even in the best case, I don't see the infinity story. Law firms don't exhibit winner-take-most dynamics. Legal services are fragmented by jurisdiction, by specialty, by client relationship, by partner reputation. The expansion narrative -- commercial contracts to broader legal services to all SMB legal needs -- runs into the reality that legal work defies aggregation at scale. There's no protocol position here, no new primitive that other businesses build on. It's an application-layer service sitting on top of broadly available AI infrastructure. The narrative expands linearly, not exponentially. And the $500-per-contract unit economics, while attractive to customers, create a linear revenue model that requires proportional attorney headcount to grow -- exactly the kind of business where growth demands proportional resource investment rather than compounding through network effects.

I respect this team enormously. If I were a growth-stage founder who needed contract review done fast and cheap, I'd be their customer in a heartbeat. But being a great service provider and being a great venture investment are different things. This is the Birchbox lesson applied to legal services: strong initial product-market fit, genuinely better customer experience, but a structural moat that erodes as every competitor adopts the same tools that made the innovation possible in the first place.
