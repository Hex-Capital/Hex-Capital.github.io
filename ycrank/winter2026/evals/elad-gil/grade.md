# Grade -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Grade is how it looks like Gusto but isn't. Payroll for creators sounds like the "too boring" pattern — purpose-built payment infrastructure for a specific segment that every company in the category needs. Gusto worked because payroll serves every employer in America, nobody was building seriously for SMBs, and the product wedge expanded naturally into HR, benefits, and compliance. Grade's setup looks similar on the surface: vertical payment infrastructure, switching costs from tax compliance records, potential to expand into adjacent financial products. But the comparison collapses on inspection. Gusto operated in a market with no credible vertical competitor and a universal customer base. Grade operates in the creator economy — one of the most consensus-hot categories in venture capital — against Lumanu ($20.6M raised), Stir ($20.7M at ~$100M valuation), MONET (€17M), and Tipalti ($200M+ ARR) encroaching from the horizontal side. The "boring but critical" pattern only works when the market is boring enough that well-funded competitors haven't shown up. They've already shown up here.

The structural moment question — what changed in the last 12-24 months — has a reasonable answer: the shift from flat-fee influencer sponsorships to performance-based compensation (pay-per-view, affiliate, hybrid). Creator ad spend hitting $37B in 2025 at 4x the growth rate of total media creates transaction volume, and variable compensation models create workflow complexity that generic AP tools weren't designed for. That's a real behavioral shift. But it's not hidden — it's the subject of conference panels, analyst reports, and VC theses. A $3.08B creator payment automation market that's already been sized, named, and projected to $7.72B by 2030 is by definition not a non-obvious market. When Research and Markets has published the TAM report, the structural moment has been priced in by the investor class. I hunt for markets where the TAM report doesn't exist yet because the category hasn't been named.

The strongest signal here is the founding team's execution velocity and domain embeddedness. James Heaney built Pray Screen to $40K MRR within two months with 250K downloads, then sold it. He exited a cryptography startup at 22. Lotanna Ezeike founded XPO — a creator payments fintech where he raised over $1M — then built and sold two travel SaaS companies, then built Creator Check. These aren't founders who pivoted into creator economy because it's trending. They've been living inside this specific problem for years, and the progression from Creator Check (screening) to Grade (payments) reflects someone who kept bumping into the same pain point from different angles. The $380K in monthly payouts with 120% month-over-month growth at pre-seed shows they can ship and sell. The co-founder relationship has been pressure-tested through Creator Check. On the execution dimension, this team is well above the median YC pre-seed company.

The bull case I'd need to believe: Grade becomes the Stripe of the creator economy. The "add a creator by email" workflow becomes the wedge into owning the company-creator financial relationship across 190 countries. Once Grade holds tax documentation and payment history for hundreds of thousands of creators, the switching costs compound. Then they distribute working capital, insurance, analytics, and compliance products through that relationship — the product-to-distribution trajectory I look for. If performance-based creator compensation becomes the default model (which seems directionally correct), the complexity layer Grade owns gets more valuable over time. In this scenario, the $3B TAM is actually undersized because Grade captures adjacent financial services revenue from both sides of the relationship. That's a plausible path. But it requires Grade to win against Lumanu and Stir — both of whom have 40x the capital — in a market where the core payment orchestration layer (Stripe, Wise) is commoditized. The differentiated layer is performance-tracking-to-payment workflow, which is real but doesn't strike me as requiring a miracle to replicate.

The distribution trajectory is my primary concern beyond market non-obviousness. I don't see evidence that the founders have articulated how Grade becomes a platform rather than a single-purpose payment tool. The dossier shows no pricing page, no confirmed revenue model, and no multi-product roadmap. At pre-seed, I don't require a fully built platform — but I need founders who can describe how their initial product relationship opens a distribution channel for the second and third product. Stripe's founders understood from day one that a developer API was a distribution strategy, not just a product choice. I'd want to hear whether Grade's team sees the creator payment relationship as a channel for broader financial services, or whether they're building a point solution.

Grade is a competent team in a real market building a product that addresses genuine workflow complexity. The founders' execution history is strong, and the domain depth is legitimate. But the market is consensus rather than non-obvious, the competitive field is already funded, and I don't see evidence of the distribution thinking that separates good companies from generational ones. This is a reasonable bet for an investor whose framework prioritizes team quality in growing markets. For my framework — which requires a non-obvious structural moment and a product-to-distribution trajectory — it doesn't clear the bar.
