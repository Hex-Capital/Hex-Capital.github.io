# Protent -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about Protent is what's *not* striking about it. Ambient.ai has $146M from a16z and is already marketing "proactive threat prevention" to enterprise customers including Adobe and VMware. Spot AI has $93M and 1,000+ customers. Lumana has $64M and 50,000 cameras deployed. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in telecom would never happen — the incumbent actively dismissed the approach. Here, the incumbents and well-capitalized startups are *pursuing* the same approach. Three hundred million dollars of smart money has already validated "AI-powered proactive surveillance." That's not a signal that Protent is right — it's a signal that the contrarian window has closed. The experts endorse the thesis, which means the thesis is already priced in.

Let me apply my primary filter: if Protent succeeds completely — achieves everything they're attempting — what changes? Surveillance operators get smarter alerts. Response times improve. Some incidents get prevented. That's genuinely valuable work that saves lives. But the surveillance industry continues to operate the same way: cameras watch, software processes, humans respond. The architecture of security doesn't change. Compare this to what Commonwealth Fusion is attempting — making fossil fuel power generation structurally obsolete — or what Square did to traditional payment infrastructure. Protent makes an existing system incrementally more intelligent. If it works perfectly, it's a good business in a $6-30 billion market. Nobody's life is reorganized. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The consequence of success is a well-run B2B SaaS company with strong retention in the security vertical. I don't invest my own money to build well-run B2B SaaS companies — I invest to change how the world operates.

The founders have relevant domain backgrounds — Balaji deployed RL-optimized video intelligence at Lockheed Martin in classified settings, Sharma researched NLP-based threat detection. That's real technical credibility. But it's precisely the kind of credibility that concerns me. These are domain insiders executing the domain's roadmap. The surveillance industry *wants* AI to make cameras smarter — this is the consensus vision, not a contrarian one. When Pat Brown said he'd make a hamburger without a cow, the food industry called him delusional. When Peter Beck said he'd launch rockets from New Zealand, aerospace engineers shook their heads. Nobody in the security industry shakes their head at "AI-powered predictive surveillance" — they're investing billions in it. The founders aren't attacking something experts consider impossible; they're building what experts already agree should exist, just with less capital than their competitors.

The strongest bull case would be this: the specific capability of pre-escalation behavioral prediction is fundamentally harder than object detection, requiring temporal sequence modeling and training data from real escalation events that commercial competitors simply cannot acquire. If Balaji's classified Lockheed Martin work produced models or architectural insights that are genuinely years ahead of what Ambient.ai or Lumana can build with commercial data, then Protent owns a capability moat that $146M of competitor funding cannot replicate. Defense-to-commercial translation has created category-defining companies — Palantir is a $60B+ company built on exactly this playbook. And if behavioral prediction achieves accuracy thresholds that turn surveillance from "monitoring" into "prevention," that *is* a paradigm shift in physical security. I'd want to see evidence of this — a deployment where their system predicted and prevented an incident that object-detection systems would have missed. That evidence doesn't exist publicly, and more importantly, the dossier notes that classified training data likely cannot transfer to commercial products due to ITAR restrictions, meaning they're rebuilding from scratch. The defense origin is a story, not yet a demonstrated commercial advantage.

The timing arithmetic doesn't favor them either. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, there was no $146M-funded competitor doing the same thing. I was skating to where the puck would be, years before consensus arrived. Protent is entering a market where the puck has already arrived, the players are on the ice, and the well-funded teams have a multi-year head start on commercial deployments and customer data flywheels. The 21-30% market CAGR reflects acceleration that is already being captured by existing players, not a nascent curve that Protent is positioned ahead of. Being a two-person YC startup competing against a16z-backed Ambient.ai with enterprise customers is not the kind of asymmetric bet I structure my portfolio around — it's a fight for market share in a validated category, which is what established venture firms fund, not what I do with my angel checks.
