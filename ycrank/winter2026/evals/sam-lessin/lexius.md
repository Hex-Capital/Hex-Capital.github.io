# Lexius -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me immediately: Veesion has already raised €53 million, deployed in 5,000+ stores across 25 countries, and is opening a U.S. office in mid-2025. Everseen has $113 million in funding. Auror is valued north of $500 million. AI-powered retail theft detection is not an idea that provokes confusion or skepticism from investors -- it's a category with hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital already committed to it. When I'm evaluating a YC pre-seed company entering a market where multiple well-funded incumbents already exist doing functionally the same thing, the "insane idea" part of my framework is dead on arrival. This isn't a sane person with an insane idea. It's a capable person with a completely consensus idea, which is the worst combination for generating outsized returns because the opportunity has already been priced into the competitive landscape.

The founders are technically competent -- David Elskamp has a Master's in Data Science and built a media agency young, Liam Webster has Berkeley EECS and privacy research credentials. But competence isn't what I'm screening for. The "sane" in my framework means domain-specific credibility that makes the crazy bet feel anchored. Neither founder comes from retail loss prevention, security operations, or production computer vision systems. They're smart generalists who identified a real market pain point, and I don't doubt they can build the software. But when you're the third or fourth entrant in a category where the leader already has 5,000 stores of training data, generic technical talent doesn't create the founder-market asymmetry I need to see. The co-founders also appear to have no shared history -- different countries, different universities, no visible prior working relationship. That's not disqualifying at pre-seed, but it's not the deep relational foundation I gravitate toward.

My bigger structural problem is that this company fails my "cherry on top" test catastrophically. If AI didn't exist, Lexius wouldn't exist. The AI isn't enhancing an already-good business -- it IS the entire business. There's no physical operation, no hardware installed base, no regulatory moat, no operational complexity that software amplifies but can't replace. It's pure software sitting on top of someone else's cameras, priced as a SaaS subscription tiered by camera count. This is precisely the category I've been publicly arguing is getting destroyed. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the core technology is accessible via modern ML frameworks" and "the general approach is replicable." When even the factual research memo is flagging commoditization risk, you know the moat problem is severe. Contrast this with Craftwork, where the moat is painting crews and scheduling logistics that no amount of cheap software replicates. Lexius has no equivalent operational barrier.

The strongest bull case I can construct: the U.S. SMB retail market is genuinely underserved right now. Veesion gets only 10% of revenue from the U.S. without a local office. There's a real window for a native, plug-and-play U.S. player to capture the long tail of grocery stores and small retailers who can't afford enterprise solutions. The FineFare case study -- 63% theft reduction, $3,520/month saved, 12x ROI over 30 days -- is a compelling data point if it holds across varied environments. And 4,000+ stores expressing interest without marketing suggests genuine pull. If Lexius could capture even a fraction of that waitlist before Veesion establishes U.S. operations, there's a path to a meaningful business. But "meaningful business" is the ceiling here, not "infinity story." The narrative expands to "AI security for all retail," maybe to adjacent use cases like customer analytics or inventory monitoring, but it never becomes a new primitive, a protocol, or infrastructure that others build on. The best case is a $200-500 million acquisition by a security or retail tech incumbent, and the realistic case is a market share fight against a competitor with a 10x funding advantage and 1,000x deployment advantage.

One more thing bothers me. The founding date ambiguity -- 2022 per Crunchbase and Novelt, 2024 per the YC page -- suggests this team has potentially been working on this for three to four years. In that period, they have three documented customer deployments and no public revenue figures. The "waitlist exploded" language from Novelt reads differently when you consider the timeline: if demand truly exploded years ago, where's the conversion? This pattern -- strong inbound interest that doesn't convert to revenue velocity -- usually indicates either a product that demos well but doesn't operationalize cleanly, or a sales motion that hasn't been figured out yet. Neither inspires confidence when you're about to compete head-to-head with a €53 million-funded company entering your market.
