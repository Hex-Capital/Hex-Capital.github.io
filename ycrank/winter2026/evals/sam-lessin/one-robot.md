# One Robot -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with One Robot, and it's the same structural problem I see in dozens of YC companies right now: the AI capability IS the product. Strip away the world model, strip away the learned simulation, strip away the synthetic data generation -- what's left? Nothing. There's no painting crew. There's no parking infrastructure. There's no protocol that other companies build on. It's pure software intelligence offered as a service, which means it's a feature waiting to be absorbed by whichever incumbent with distribution decides deformable-object simulation matters enough to build it. NVIDIA already gives away Isaac Sim under Apache 2.0. Cosmos has 20 million hours of training data behind it. When a $3 trillion company is distributing your competitive category for free as a strategic loss leader to sell more GPUs, you have a structural positioning problem that no amount of founder brilliance can solve.

The founders are genuinely strong -- I want to be clear about that. Hemanth Sarabu's trajectory from NASA JPL (Early Career Achievement Medal, which is no joke) to Google to bootstrapping Crescer AI to profitability tells me he's not a fundraising optimizer. The bootstrapped-to-profitability detail is the kind of signal I weigh heavily -- it demonstrates operational discipline, the "tizz" side of my framework. Elton Shon's five years building Tesla factory automation and Dojo infrastructure means he understands real-world robot data pipelines at a level most founders don't. They worked together at Industrial Next, a YC W22 robotics company, which gives me confidence in the co-founder relationship. These are credible people. But they're credible people pursuing a consensus opportunity, and that's the worst configuration in my framework. Every major lab -- Google DeepMind, Meta, NVIDIA, Runway ($860M raised, $5.3B valuation) -- is working on world models for robotics. The idea that simulation environments should be learned from data rather than hand-authored is the dominant thesis in the space right now. When I say I look for "sane person, insane idea," One Robot gives me two sane people with a thoroughly sane idea.

The bull case -- and I want to engage with it seriously because the founders deserve it -- goes something like this: task-specific world models for contact-rich deformable-object manipulation (textiles, flexible materials, box folding) represent a genuinely distinct problem from general-purpose simulation. Rigid-body physics engines fundamentally can't handle soft materials well. If One Robot accumulates enough task-specific training data from customer deployments, they build a data flywheel that general-purpose platforms can't replicate because NVIDIA doesn't have the incentive to go deep on every niche manipulation task. This is essentially the Airtable exception argument -- it looks like an application-layer tool but actually functions as a new primitive for a specific category of robot training. For this to work, three things must simultaneously be true: (1) general-purpose world models must NOT get good enough at deformable objects to make specialization irrelevant, (2) the task-specific data flywheel must spin fast enough to create compounding advantage before the funding runway expires, and (3) robotics teams must actually pay for simulation environments rather than building their own. I find each of these uncertain, and requiring all three to hold simultaneously makes the probability uncomfortably low.

My "cherry on top" test kills this. Would this business exist, let alone be good, if AI didn't exist? Obviously not. The entire value proposition is an AI model generating synthetic training data for other AI models. Compare this to Craftwork, where the painting business is perfectly viable without AI and technology just makes scheduling and quality control more efficient. One Robot is AI training AI -- it's recursive dependency on the very technology stack I believe incumbents will control. "Winner of AI race depends on consumer distribution," and One Robot has no distribution. When Runway can point GWM Robotics at the same problem with $860M of backing, or when NVIDIA extends Cosmos with a manipulation-focused variant as a free add-on, the startup's technical differentiation evaporates.

The inferred business model compounds my concern. Usage-based or SaaS pricing for simulation environments is software-as-business-model, not software-as-business-tool. I've spent the last two years arguing that this category is structurally declining. The market they're targeting -- $1.5B in robotics simulation, growing to $4.2B by 2033 -- is real but not an "infinity story." And within that market, the free tier from NVIDIA sets a price ceiling that constrains the entire category's revenue potential. I see strong founders who should be building something with physical-world operations that their robotics expertise could make exceptional. What I don't see is a business that gets stronger as software gets cheaper.
