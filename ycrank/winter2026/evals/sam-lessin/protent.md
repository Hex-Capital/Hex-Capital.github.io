# Protent -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Protent is the competitive landscape table, and it tells the whole story before I even get to the founders. Ambient.ai has $146 million from a16z. Spot AI has $93 million. Lumana has $64 million. Actuate has $24 million. When four companies in your exact market have collectively raised over $300 million, you are not pursuing an insane idea. You are pursuing one of the most obvious applications of computer vision that exists in 2026. "AI for surveillance cameras" is the kind of thing every VC nods along to -- large installed base of cameras, humans can't watch them all, computer vision is mature, the TAM deck writes itself. This is the consensus dressed up as innovation, and consensus is where returns go to die.

Balaji's background is genuinely strong -- deploying reinforcement learning-optimized video intelligence in classified settings at Lockheed Martin, then AWS AI/ML. That's the "sane" half of my equation, and I respect it. Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Lockheed Martin Research, Amazon -- this is a credentialed, serious person. But the pairing is wrong. A sane person with a sane idea is just a well-qualified employee who should probably stay at AWS. The specific differentiation -- predicting escalation trajectories rather than detecting objects -- is clever, but it's a feature within a consensus category, not a non-consensus bet. Ambient.ai already markets "proactive threat prevention." The gap between "proactive detection" and "predictive escalation" is a product positioning argument, not a structural moat.

Here's where my framework really bites: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? No. Without AI, there is no product. AI isn't the cherry on top -- it IS the sundae, the bowl, and the spoon. This is exactly the category I've been publicly arguing is uninvestable for startups. The winner of AI capabilities depends on distribution, and in enterprise security, distribution means compliance certifications, existing VMS integrations, multi-year contracts with security operations centers, and established sales teams calling on CISOs. Ambient.ai has Adobe and VMware as customers. Lumana has McDonald's and Meta. A two-person pre-seed team doesn't outrun that kind of installed distribution advantage by having marginally better temporal modeling.

The defense-to-commercial translation creates a particularly cruel structural problem that I think most investors would miss. The moat everyone wants to believe in -- proprietary models trained on classified escalation data at Lockheed Martin -- is legally non-transferable. ITAR and classification restrictions mean that training data stays behind the SCIF door. Balaji brings knowledge and intuition about what escalation patterns look like, but the actual models and data assets start from zero in the commercial context. So the one element that might have created a genuine, non-replicable advantage is the one element that can't cross the defense-commercial boundary. What remains is a smart ML team competing against $300 million in aggregate competitor funding with commodity access to the same foundation models everyone else uses.

The bull case would require believing that escalation prediction is so technically differentiated that it becomes a new primitive -- a layer that VMS platforms integrate rather than build themselves. If Protent could establish "predictive escalation scoring" as a standardized data feed that Genetec, Milestone, and every other VMS vendor plugs into, that starts to look like protocol-layer positioning. The defense experience would give them credibility in high-security verticals where false positives carry extreme costs, and the reinforcement learning approach (models that improve through deployment feedback loops) could theoretically compound into a data moat over time. If I squint hard enough, there's a version of this where Protent becomes the threat-intelligence primitive that every camera system calls -- the Stripe of security feeds. But that requires surviving long enough to establish the standard while Ambient.ai spends $146 million trying to own the same layer. The timing and capital disadvantage is severe.

I keep coming back to the structural logic. This is a software company whose moat is a machine learning model in a market where foundation models are rapidly commoditizing computer vision capabilities. Lumana is already using vision-language models for surveillance. The specific technical advantage of escalation prediction via temporal sequence modeling is real but narrow -- it's the kind of capability that gets absorbed into a platform update, not the kind that sustains an independent company through three platform shifts. I'd genuinely rather fund a physical security company that uses AI to optimize guard dispatch routes than an AI company that sells to physical security operations. The former gets stronger as AI gets cheaper. The latter gets more commoditized.
