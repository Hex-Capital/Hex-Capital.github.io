# General Legal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with General Legal: this is a team that built the most successful legal AI company in history, sold it for $650 million to Thomson Reuters, and then went and built the exact thing you'd predict they'd build next. That's the problem for me. When I hear that Ryan Walker was CTO of Casetext through the exit, that J.P. Mohler bridged law practice at Cooley with ML research at Casetext, that Javed worked on the R&D side of the same company — I think, yes, these are exceptionally capable people. But I also think: this is the credentialed, logical, predictable next step for a team with this background. And the investments that have defined my career have never been the predictable next step for anyone. AI-native legal services is one of the hottest investment categories right now — $6 billion in legal tech funding in 2025, Lawhive raising $60 million for a similar hybrid model, Harvey valued at $8-11 billion, and two other YC W26 companies building AI-native law firms in adjacent practice areas. When everyone in the room sees the same opportunity, the price discovery has already happened and the weirdness has been sanded off.

If I'm being honest about what I'd hear if I asked these founders to tell me their stories — not the business, just how they got here — I'd hear about Harvard Law School, elite firm placements, and a successful acquisition. Those are real accomplishments, but they're not the kind of biographical thread that makes me believe someone will persist through the dark moments when the company is about to die. I think about Travis Kalanick's gravitas, or the Contraline founder who spent years in academic research everyone ignored, or my own fifty rejections pitching Zivity. I'm listening for the hardship that forged an unbreakable bond between the founder and the problem. What I hear with General Legal is professional pattern recognition — they saw an opportunity at the intersection of their skills and a market shift — not a wound that demands healing. That doesn't mean they'll fail. It means I can't access the signal I rely on most.

The bull case is genuinely strong, and I want to be fair about that. The specific model — being a licensed law firm, not selling tools to law firms — is actually a harder and more defensible path than what most legal AI companies are pursuing. Harvey and Spellbook sell picks and shovels to the existing legal industry. General Legal is trying to replace the industry itself with something structurally different. That takes real courage and regulatory sophistication. The team is uniquely equipped for it: two founders who practiced at top venture capital law firms understand the client side, and the CTO who built and exited the leading legal AI platform understands the technology side. The 20+ clients from a private preview suggests real pull. And the flat-fee, transparent pricing model does carry a faint echo of what Affirm did to credit card fees — making an opaque cost structure visible. If the unit economics work at $500 per contract with AI-driven efficiency, this could grow into something very large. The moat of being a regulated entity is real; you can't just ship code and call it a law firm.

But the economic access dimension is where this falls short for me. They're saving growth-stage startup founders a few hundred dollars per contract. These are founders who already have venture capital funding, already have access to legal counsel, already sit inside the most resource-rich ecosystem in the business world. This isn't creating economic opportunity for people who lack it — it's creating convenience for people who already have plenty. Compare that to how I think about Uber creating income for drivers, or Affirm extending transparent credit to people shut out by hidden fees, or Thumbtack connecting skilled tradespeople with customers. General Legal makes legal services slightly cheaper and faster for an already-privileged population. That's a real business, but it's not the kind of impact that gives me the jolt of energy I need to write a check from my own money.

One detail in the dossier caught my eye: the YC page describes Javed as having "co-founded Casetext," while multiple other sources show him joining five years after founding. That kind of credential inflation, if that's what it is, is exactly the sort of polish-over-substance signal that makes me cautious. It may have a perfectly reasonable explanation — maybe he was instrumental in a major pivot or relaunch — but when I'm evaluating founders, I want unvarnished truth, not curated narrative. The co-founder relationship itself looks solid: these three have worked together through an acquisition and co-authored research together, which is meaningful. That's a team that's been stress-tested in ways that matter.

Ultimately, General Legal is a highly competent team executing a well-reasoned strategy in a crowded, hot market. That's a profile that makes a lot of investors excited. It doesn't make me excited. I'm looking for the misfits and the free thinkers, the ideas that make people uncomfortable, the founders who were told no fifty times and kept going because the problem was etched into their identity. This team was told yes — at Harvard, at Cooley, at Fenwick, at Thomson Reuters — and they've earned every bit of it. But my portfolio is built on the people who had to fight for their first yes.
