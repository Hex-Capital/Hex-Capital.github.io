# Pocket -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me start with what immediately jumped out: Plaud has already bootstrapped to $100 million in annual recurring revenue selling AI recording devices. Pocket is entering a market where the model has been proven, the form factor validated, and the competitive dynamics are consolidating around Big Tech acquisitions. Meta bought Limitless. Amazon bought Bee. When the incumbents are acquiring your competitors, you're either the last one standing or the next target. Narisetti says he's declined acquisition approaches -- and that's admirable -- but declining an acqui-hire while competing against a bootstrapped competitor with orders of magnitude more scale and two tech giants absorbing your category is not contrarian courage. It's competitive positioning in a proven market. And I have to ask the question I always ask first: if Pocket wins -- if it becomes the dominant AI note-taking device -- what actually changes about the world?

The answer, frankly, is not much. Professionals get slightly better meeting notes. Some conversations that would have been forgotten get captured. The digital voice recorder market grows from $2 billion to maybe $5-10 billion as AI features penetrate. That is the definition of a consequence of success that doesn't justify the effort of the attempt. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No industry becomes structurally obsolete. No trillion-dollar system gets displaced. Compare this to what I look for: Juniper making Cisco's architecture economically irrelevant, Impossible Foods making animal agriculture unnecessary, Commonwealth Fusion Systems making fossil fuel power generation obsolete. A better recording gadget -- however well-executed -- lives in a different universe of ambition. The founders have narrowed their scope to where the probability of building a real business is reasonable, but they've done so at the expense of building something that matters at civilizational scale.

The technology reinforces my concern. The dossier itself states the core technology stack -- microphones, Bluetooth, AI transcription APIs -- is commercially available. There is no deep moat here. No proprietary science. No 10x breakthrough that makes the existing approach uneconomic. The differentiation is product design and integration at a lower price point ($99 versus Plaud's comparable pricing). That's operational execution, not technology disruption. When I invested in Square, the mobile payment stack wasn't just cheaper point-of-sale -- it made the entire traditional POS infrastructure structurally unnecessary for millions of small merchants who had never accepted cards. Pocket doesn't do that to anything. It's a marginally better version of tools that already exist -- Otter.ai in software, Plaud in hardware, even a smartphone's native recording app with a third-party transcription service. HIPAA compliance could be a genuine differentiator for regulated industries, but the Trustpilot reviews describing users receiving another person's meeting transcripts and HIPAA-sensitive data appearing translated into Korean through shared URLs directly undermine that claim. When your marketed moat has public evidence of failure, you've lost the one wedge that might have given you structural advantage.

The strongest bull case here rests on the founder and the trajectory of AI wearables as a category. Akshay Narisetti is 23 years old, turned down multiple Google offers, built open-source AI hardware before founding Pocket, earned one of 16 spots globally in the Harvard/MIT Augmentation Lab, and is shipping a real physical product that real people are buying. That's impressive at any age. The wearable AI market is growing at 25-34% CAGR, and there's a plausible future where these devices evolve from note-takers into always-on AI interfaces that reshape how humans interact with computing. If that exponential curve materializes and Pocket rides it from recording device to general-purpose AI companion hardware, the consequence magnitude shifts dramatically. But that vision isn't in the dossier -- what's in the dossier is a recording device with AI transcription at $99. The bull case requires Pocket to become something fundamentally different from what it currently is, and I don't invest in what a company might pivot into. I invest in the magnitude of the problem the founder is actively attacking.

What I notice that others might miss: this team has optimized for de-risking. Proven market (Plaud validated it), proven form factor (small device, single button), competitive pricing ($99 undercuts alternatives), freemium subscription model -- every choice reduces the probability of failure. That pattern is precisely what I warn founders against. They've built a playbook that works for capturing a slice of an existing market. But they haven't built a thesis for why the world needs to work differently. The $2K-$5K salary for their open developer role tells me the operating budget is severely constrained, which compounds the problem: you can't pursue transformational ambition on a shoestring while simultaneously managing hardware manufacturing, supply chain logistics, inventory, and customer support for a physical product. This is a team executing well against a small target, and I pass on those bets regardless of execution quality.
