# Byteport -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is a gap between the claims and the verifiable evidence. "Built by the team that developed Netflix Workstations" is marketing language that describes a solo 18-year-old founder. "50x faster than TCP" and "4x faster than Netflix" are performance claims with zero published benchmarks, no whitepapers, and no independent validation. I don't require proof at pre-seed -- I require a builder's trail. Zero public GitHub repositories. No visible technical artifact that shows this protocol exists beyond a landing page. When I backed Stack Overflow, Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood had spent years building in public -- you could read their thinking, see their code, trace the evolution of their understanding. Here, the specific knowledge claim rests almost entirely on an unverifiable Netflix affiliation and a Fermilab research associate stint that may or may not have involved actual data transfer infrastructure. The published research is in volumetric reconstruction using Q-Learning -- ML and computer vision, not networking or protocol design. The honest question is: what does this founder know about data transfer that a competent systems engineer with six months of study couldn't learn?

The leverage architecture, in theory, is the right shape. A transfer protocol is pure code leverage -- you write it once and it serves every customer's data. Pay-per-GB consumption pricing scales with usage, not headcount. And this sits at the infrastructure layer, which is where I prefer to invest. The trouble is that this specific infrastructure layer has been built multiple times already. IBM Aspera patented FASP over a decade ago. FileCatalyst, Raysync, and MASV all offer UDP-based acceleration with production-proven deployments. This isn't Extropic inventing thermodynamic computing from first principles -- it's a known engineering category with established players. The question isn't whether fast file transfer is valuable. It's whether there's a genuine protocol breakthrough here or better packaging of existing techniques. Without published technical work, I can't distinguish between the two.

The strongest bull case is real, and I want to name it clearly. If the Netflix infrastructure experience is genuine and deep, this founder has lived inside the exact problem -- moving massive media files at global scale -- at one of the companies that defines the category. Fermilab adds scientific data at petabyte scale. The AI training data movement opportunity is explosively growing, and the incumbents are structurally trapped: Aspera can't cannibalize IBM's enterprise pricing with a self-serve $0.15/GB model, Signiant's $42.5M revenue is built on enterprise contracts they won't disrupt. A lightweight, zero-config protocol that genuinely outperforms -- positioned as "Stripe for large file transfer" -- could thread a needle that incumbents can't reach. If I could verify the Netflix claim, see an engineering artifact, and confirm that the 50x claim has any basis in measured reality, this would look meaningfully different. Dropping out of a full-ride scholarship at 18 to build infrastructure software does signal genuine conviction over career optimization.

But I can't invest on "if." The contrarian timing angle is weaker than it appears. "The incumbents are slow and expensive" is not a secret -- it's MASV's pitch, it's every startup's pitch in this space. MASV already exists with the same SaaS model, targeting the same VFX beachhead, at one-third the price ($0.05/GB vs. $0.15/GB). The 3x pricing premium demands measurably superior performance that hasn't been demonstrated. UDP-based transfer acceleration is not a contrarian bet -- it's a fifteen-year-old technology category. What would be contrarian is a fundamentally new approach to data movement, something that makes UDP acceleration look primitive. I don't see evidence of that here.

The solo founder question is relevant but not for the reason most people think. I'm not concerned about an 18-year-old -- age is uncorrelated with specific knowledge, and young founders have built extraordinary things. I'm concerned about the absence of a visible body of work. When I evaluate a technologist, I look for evidence that they've been building compulsively -- open source contributions, technical writing, protocol experiments, anything that demonstrates the obsessive curiosity that produces non-teachable understanding. Three GitHub followers, zero public repositories, and a LinkedIn profile with 188 connections gives me nothing to evaluate. In the technology business, if you don't have a builder or product to evaluate, how are you supposed to invest?

I'm passing. Not because the market is wrong or the architecture is wrong -- infrastructure plays with consumption pricing in growing markets are exactly my pattern. I'm passing because the specific knowledge case is unverified, the technology claims are undifferentiated from existing solutions, and the competitive positioning (3x premium pricing against an established lower-cost competitor) requires demonstrated superiority that doesn't exist in any public form. Show me the protocol working at scale, show me the Netflix provenance is real, show me why this is fundamentally different from MASV with better marketing -- and I'll look again.
