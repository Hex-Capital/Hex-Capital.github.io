# Piris Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Piris Labs: the photonic AI inference space has already absorbed over $1.5 billion in venture capital. Lightmatter sits at a $4.4 billion valuation. Ayar Labs has NVIDIA and Intel Capital on its cap table. Olix just raised at a billion-dollar valuation. When I look at a category and see that kind of capital concentration, my instinct is that the weirdness has been priced out. The most promising companies are not popular -- and photonic AI infrastructure is becoming very popular. A two-person pre-seed team entering a category where competitors have raised $118 million to $850 million and still haven't shipped commercial products isn't contrarian in the way I'm drawn to. It's brave, maybe, but bravery and anti-consensus conviction are different things. When I backed SpaceX, private space was a punchline. When I backed Crusoe, people thought mining Bitcoin on gas flares was deranged. Photonic interconnects for AI in 2026 is a thesis that institutional investors are already writing nine-figure checks to validate.

What I can't assess -- and this is the part that nags at me -- is the founders' stories. Ali Khalatpour has a genuinely rare technical pedigree. Building the terahertz optical engine for NASA's GUSTO mission during your MIT PhD is not a line on a resume you can fake. That's someone who has designed and fabricated photonic devices that went to space. And Keyvan Moghadam scaled AI systems at Meta and X, which means he understands the infrastructure pain at the exact companies that would be customers. On paper, this pairing of a photonic hardware physicist and an AI infrastructure engineer is almost too perfectly matched to the problem. But I don't know their stories. I don't know how Ali got to MIT, what drove him from terahertz lasers to inference infrastructure, whether there's a personal thread connecting his life to this specific problem beyond intellectual fascination. The dossier gives me credentials -- MIT, NASA, Stanford, Harvard, Meta -- and every one of those is an establishment institution. I evaluate founders through the lens of what they've survived, not where they've been credentialed, and I have no data on that dimension here. That doesn't mean the grit isn't there. It means I can't find my signal.

The full-stack service model is the genuine differentiator -- everyone else in the photonic AI space is selling components (Lightmatter sells interconnects, Ayar Labs sells chiplets), while Piris Labs wants to deliver inference-as-a-service on proprietary photonic hardware. That vertical integration is a more ambitious play and theoretically creates deeper switching costs. It reminds me of how the best infrastructure investments I've made weren't just building a piece of the stack but owning the whole experience. But here's my concern: this is a conceptual differentiator at this stage. No prototype, no benchmark data, no customer validation. The claimed 5x lower latency and 10x lower power per bit are unverified. And the capital required to go from concept to production photonic hardware dwarfs what a pre-seed round provides. Neurophos raised $118 million and won't have chips until mid-2028. The gap between Piris Labs' resources and what this roadmap demands is enormous.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because it deserves serious consideration. If Khalatpour's NASA-grade photonic engineering can produce even a working prototype that demonstrates the claimed performance advantages, this team could raise significant follow-on capital quickly -- the market appetite for photonic AI infrastructure is obviously there. The service model, if executed, would create a fundamentally different competitive position from every other photonic startup. And the inference market is heading toward $255 billion by 2030, meaning even a fractional capture is transformational. The YC stamp and Ankit Gupta as primary partner suggest the technical vision cleared a credible filter. If these founders have a deeper personal connection to this problem than what's visible in the dossier, and if they've stress-tested their partnership through prior adversity, this could be the kind of bet that looks obvious in retrospect. But I'm not investing in what *could* be true with more information -- I'm investing in what I can feel in my bones based on what's in front of me.

What I don't see here is economic access. This is B2B infrastructure that makes AI inference cheaper for companies already running trillion-parameter models. You can draw a line several steps out to "cheaper inference democratizes AI for everyone," but that's not the direct, tangible impact I gravitate toward. Uber created income for Roger, my driver, the day it launched. Affirm gave transparent credit to people who'd been exploited by hidden fees. Piris Labs optimizes data movement for hyperscale AI workloads. It's important work, but it doesn't create the kind of economic access that pulls me in emotionally. And on the co-founder dynamics front, I have nothing -- no information on how Ali and Keyvan met, how they resolve disagreements, or whether they've been through a crisis together. After HQ Trivia, that absence of signal isn't neutral for me.

This is a technically impressive team in a category that no longer needs me to see what others can't. I'm passing -- not because the founders aren't capable, but because my edge as an investor comes from backing things that look ridiculous to everyone else, and photonic AI infrastructure has crossed the threshold into respectability.
