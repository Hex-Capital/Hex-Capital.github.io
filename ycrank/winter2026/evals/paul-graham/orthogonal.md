# Orthogonal -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Orthogonal is the neighborhood it chose to live in. "Agentic payments for APIs" sits at the intersection of three of the hottest categories in tech right now: AI agents, payments infrastructure, and API tooling. Skyfire has $9.5M. Nevermined has $7M. Coinbase and Cloudflare built x402. Stripe and OpenAI launched ACP. Google built AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. When I wrote that the most impressive YC companies I've seen recently are not working on AI, this is what I meant. When every major payments company and every major AI company is converging on your problem simultaneously, the question isn't whether the problem is real -- it obviously is -- but whether a two-person startup can win a land grab against organizations with thousands of engineers and existing distribution to every developer on earth.

The origin story here is ambiguous, and that matters to me. Christian Pickett worked on payments at Coinbase and billing at Vercel. Bera Sogut built APIs at Google -- reCAPTCHA and Maps specifically. Those backgrounds map cleanly onto the problem. Almost too cleanly. When Drew Houston forgot his USB drive, that was an involuntary encounter with a problem. When the Collisons got frustrated sending API calls to banks, they were living inside the pain. With Orthogonal, I see two people with highly relevant resumes who noticed a category forming and positioned themselves at its center. That's different from stumbling into an unsolved problem through lived frustration. The dossier contains no moment of organic discovery -- no "I was building an agent workflow and hit this wall," no specific incident that made the problem personal. Maybe that story exists and just didn't surface in research. But its absence is the kind of thing I pay attention to.

The schlep test is where this gets interesting, and ultimately where it falls short of the comparison I suspect the founders want me to make. Stripe worked because the schlep was so deep -- banking regulations, PCI compliance, money transmission licenses, fraud detection across jurisdictions -- that it created a structural moat. Nobody wanted to wade into that swamp. Orthogonal's schlep is different in kind: integrating API-by-API, handling each provider's unique authentication and error patterns, managing per-call billing reconciliation. That's tedious work. But it's not the kind of regulatory and institutional complexity that keeps well-funded competitors away. The dossier itself acknowledges this: "The technical complexity of building an API aggregation and payment layer is moderate. Any well-funded competitor with marketplace-building experience could replicate the core functionality." When the schlep is moderate, the barrier is speed, not depth. And speed advantages at pre-seed are fragile.

The bull case is real, and I want to be honest about it. If MCP becomes the dominant standard for agent tool-calling -- and Anthropic is pushing hard on this -- then the aggregation layer above MCP could be genuinely valuable. Orthogonal's bet is that protocols like x402 and ACP will handle payment rails, but nobody is building the marketplace layer that sits above them: discovery, unified auth, skill packaging. That's a coherent architectural thesis. And the founders are technically strong -- Sogut's two ICPC World Finals appearances (ranked 24th in one) signal the kind of programming talent I look for. They've already shipped a working product with 14+ integrations, a CLI, an SDK, and documentation. These are builders, not slideware operators. If they can achieve supply-side density before the protocol-layer incumbents decide to build their own aggregation, they could become the default. The pay-per-call model with no minimums is the right pricing architecture for agent consumption, and incumbents' subscription models create real cannibalization hesitancy.

But the competitive dynamics are what keep me from writing a check. I've written about how the best startup ideas are the ones that seem terrible -- where smart people say "that will never work." Nobody is saying that about agentic API payments. Everyone thinks this will work. The disagreement is only about who will win. That's a different game. It's a game where distribution and capital matter more than insight, where the winner is determined by business development capacity rather than product brilliance. Fourteen integrations is a start, but when Stripe and Coinbase can offer API providers access to millions of existing developers on day one, Orthogonal's supply-side chicken-and-egg problem becomes existential. I don't see evidence that users are pulling this product toward them -- no organic growth signals, no revenue, no user counts, no Product Hunt launch, no Hacker News presence. At pre-seed that's not disqualifying, but combined with the crowded landscape, it means I'm being asked to bet on execution in a category where execution alone may not be enough.

The founders are good. The technical credentials are strong. The problem is real. But this feels like a company born from the convergence of two resumes and a trending category rather than from an organic encounter with a problem nobody else wanted to touch. I'd want to hear the founders describe the specific moment this became personal -- not "we have the right backgrounds" but "we couldn't not build this." Without that, and with this many well-capitalized competitors, I pass.
