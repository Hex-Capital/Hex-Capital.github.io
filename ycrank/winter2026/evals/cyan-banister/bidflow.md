# Bidflow -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Bidflow is the pivot. Jesse and Gautham were building QA agents for bug detection -- Ghostship, YC S25 -- and somewhere between that batch and this one, they landed on electrical estimating for contractors. Their YC Launch contact email still points to tryghostship.dev. Their LinkedIn profiles still say "YC S25." And now they're telling electrical contractors how to count receptacles on 500-page blueprint PDFs. When I sit down with a founder, the first thing I want to know is: how did you get here? Not the business pitch -- the actual life path that deposited you at this exact problem. And with Bidflow, that thread doesn't connect. These are two brilliant competitive programmers who found a market opportunity, not two people whose biography led them to this specific pain. That distinction matters enormously to me.

I want to be fair about what's genuinely impressive here, because the raw talent is real. Jesse was USACO Platinum -- top one percent nationally -- and externed at Jane Street at eighteen. Gautham bootstrapped something to $120K in revenue by sixteen and published reinforcement learning research. They met in a middle school coding class and have been building together for over a decade, through CerealCodes, Ghostship, and now this. That co-founder bond is the strongest signal in the entire dossier. After watching HQ Trivia disintegrate because two co-founders couldn't resolve their differences despite having a transformative product at the perfect moment, I pay very close attention to how long founding teams have survived together. A decade of shared projects and shared failures is rare and meaningful -- these two know how to work through problems together.

Now, the bull case. Electrical estimating is exactly the kind of invisible, fragmented system I've gravitated toward throughout my portfolio -- Carta made cap tables visible, Affirm made interest rates transparent, Flock Safety surfaced public safety data. The process of how billions of dollars in electrical contracting work gets priced is buried inside spreadsheets and thirty-year-old desktop software that nobody in Silicon Valley has bothered to modernize. The incumbents -- ConEst, Trimble Accubid, McCormick -- are architecturally frozen. Mid-market electrical contractors are skilled tradespeople, the kind of people I care about investing in, and a 5x reduction in estimating time means they can bid on more jobs and compete with larger firms. That's a real economic access story. And the data center construction boom creates genuine urgency -- more projects, more complex electrical infrastructure, fewer available estimators. If you squint, this looks like a sleepy vertical about to get disrupted by two technically exceptional founders who happened to stumble into it.

But here's what keeps me from feeling the jolt. The pivot happened so recently that they haven't had time to develop the kind of domain fluency that separates a good product from a great one. Electrical contractors are conservative buyers with long sales cycles -- you need to speak their language, show up at NECA conferences, understand the politics of competitive bidding on thin margins. Three named customers and an 83.5% accuracy rate is a start, but that accuracy means roughly one in six counts needs manual correction. On a large project with thousands of data points, that's still a lot of rework. And the competitive landscape is more crowded than it first appears -- Beam AI has $48 million in funding and 1,100 customers, and they're expanding into electrical. Togal.AI has $17.5 million and growing. When I think about the companies I've backed that created real category ownership -- Crusoe turning waste gas into computation, Flock Safety building a neighborhood intelligence layer from nothing -- those founders had a multi-year head start on understanding their domain before anyone else noticed. Jesse and Gautham are arriving at an already-heating category without that advantage.

I keep coming back to a core tension in how I invest: I love founders who enter spaces others consider beneath them, but I need the founder's conviction to come from somewhere deeper than market analysis. The electrical estimating vertical fits my pattern of backing companies in unglamorous, overlooked categories. The tradespeople-as-users fits my economic access thesis. The co-founder relationship is genuinely strong. But the biographical thread -- the thing I evaluate before anything else -- isn't there. These are two technically gifted young people who could build almost anything, and they chose this because the market opportunity presented itself, not because their life story demanded it. That's a fine reason to start a company, but it's not the signal I've learned to trust for writing early checks from my own money.
