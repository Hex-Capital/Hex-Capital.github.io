# Tepali -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Tepali is that it's entering a space where the money has already arrived. Boulevard closed an $80 million Series D in July 2025 specifically to push deeper into medspas with AI features. AestheticsPro has been building medspa-specific software for years. Zenoti sits at $331 million in funding and $174 million in revenue. When I look at a company, one of the clearest signals I trust is whether the opportunity is unpopular — whether other investors have passed, whether the idea makes people uncomfortable or confused. Medspa vertical SaaS in 2026, with an AI layer on top, is neither confusing nor unpopular. It's consensus. The thesis that fragmented SMB software stacks should be consolidated into vertical platforms is one of the most well-worn playbooks in SaaS. Layering "AI-native" on top of it is what every YC company is claiming right now. There's nothing here that would make anyone uncomfortable, and that makes me uncomfortable.

The bigger issue for me is the founder story — or rather, the absence of one. My whole evaluation starts with "tell me how you got here," and with Tepali, I can't find the biographical thread that ties these founders to medical aesthetics. Chrisvin Jabamani has a polished path: NYU Stern, PJT Partners investment banking, business ops at Rilla. That's a competent résumé, and his GitHub shows real technical ability across mobile development and AI tooling. But nothing in his public history connects him to medspas, to healthcare, to the specific frustrations of running a medical aesthetics practice. He ran a Substack analyzing startup investing theses — which tells me he thinks about opportunities analytically, as market gaps on a spreadsheet. That's a legitimate way to find a company, but it's not my way, and historically the founders I've backed are solving problems they lived inside of. The second co-founder, Vishnu Pathmanaban, is essentially a ghost in public data — no LinkedIn details, no GitHub, no Twitter. For a two-person team where each founder's capabilities are existential, not being able to assess half the founding team is a real problem for me.

Let me be honest about the bull case, because there is one. The medspa industry is growing at nearly 16% annually, accelerated by GLP-1 medications creating new demand for body contouring and preventive aesthetics. The HIPAA compliance requirement is a genuine structural barrier that keeps horizontal salon software like Vagaro and Mangomint from easily sliding into this market — you can't just bolt medical charting and injection maps onto a booking tool without fundamentally changing your compliance posture. If Tepali can get embedded in even a small network of medspas and own the full data loop from ad click to patient lifetime value, the switching costs become formidable. And Chrisvin's experience at Rilla — an AI sales coaching platform sold to fragmented SMBs — is genuinely relevant operational pattern-matching for selling to independent medspa operators. The opportunity is real. But the opportunity being real is exactly why Boulevard just raised $80 million to go after it.

What I don't see here is any of the signal I've learned to trust. I don't see founders whose personal history made this problem inevitable for them. I don't see an idea that other investors consider too weird to fund — this is table-stakes vertical SaaS. I don't see a company that creates economic access or makes invisible systems visible for people who need it — this is operational efficiency software for business owners who are already doing well. The recent rename from Lotus to Tepali (evidenced by the uselotus.ai email domain still in use) suggests the company may still be finding its identity, which is fine at pre-seed, but combined with the absence of domain expertise and the competitive headwinds, it adds to a picture of a team that identified a market gap analytically rather than from the kind of deep, personal conviction I need to feel before writing a check. I'd want to sit across from these founders and hear something I can't find in the dossier — some personal connection to this world that explains why they'll still be grinding on medspa software when Boulevard is outspending them ten to one.
