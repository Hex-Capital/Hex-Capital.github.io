# Booko -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Booko is a structural observation that's genuinely clever: Mindbody can't build what Booko is building without cannibalizing ClassPass. When Mindbody acquired ClassPass, they locked themselves into a marketplace model that takes 20% of every dynamically priced transaction. Offering businesses a tool to do their own dynamic pricing would undermine that revenue stream directly. It's the kind of incumbent channel conflict that creates real openings for startups. But an opening is not the same as an organic problem. And when I ask the question I always ask first — how did these founders find this problem? — the answer concerns me.

Neither founder ran a fitness studio, managed a med spa, or operated any service business with perishable time slots. Will Hall ran a digital marketing agency. Arjun Saluja worked on dynamic pricing at Joby Aviation, which is airplanes, not hair appointments. The intellectual transfer is obvious: yield management has worked for airlines for forty years, hotels adopted it twenty years ago, so why not salons? It's a reasonable observation. But it's exactly the kind of observation you'd make sitting in an economics class at Dartmouth, not the kind you'd make because you personally watched empty appointment slots eat your business alive. When Drew Houston kept forgetting his USB drive, that was organic. When the Airbnb founders couldn't make rent and started renting their own apartment, that was organic. When two recent graduates notice a pattern across industries and apply it to a new vertical, that's an intellectual exercise. The idea could have been generated by anyone who's read a revenue management textbook and a TechCrunch article about ClassPass.

The schlep here is real but not terrifying. Building API integrations with Mindbody, Vagaro, and Acuity is genuine engineering work — normalizing data across platforms, handling different pricing models, managing the ML pipeline for demand prediction. But it's not the kind of schlep that unconsciously repels founders. It's not dealing with banking regulators like Stripe, or building trust between strangers like Airbnb, or navigating FAA certification like Boom. It's the kind of work a competent engineering team does in a few months. Any scheduling platform could add an ML pricing feature as a product extension, and Vagaro's acquisition of Schedulicity in January 2025 signals exactly the kind of consolidation ambition that would make that likely. The moat, if one exists, would come from accumulated data across customers — but that flywheel hasn't started spinning yet, and the data advantage only materializes at a scale this company is nowhere near.

The strongest bull case is this: there are millions of service businesses worldwide pricing statically, and the concept is proven in adjacent verticals. If Booko becomes the default pricing layer for appointment-based businesses the way a few companies have become default infrastructure for their categories, the outcome is large. Arjun's dynamic pricing experience at Joby, while in a different domain, means the team isn't starting from zero on the technical problem. And the 20% uplift claim, if real and repeatable, is the kind of concrete value proposition that sells itself. For this to work, they'd need to demonstrate that the ML actually outperforms simple rule-based discounting (offer 15% off any slot less than 30% booked 24 hours before), that integration with booking platforms is durable rather than subject to revocation, and that service business owners are willing to cede pricing control to an algorithm. Each of those is possible. None is demonstrated.

What I don't see is evidence that anyone is pulling this product toward them. The website claims early customers see 15-25% revenue uplift "within the first 2 weeks," but there are no named customers, no case studies, no testimonials, no revenue numbers, no user counts. At pre-seed I don't expect much traction data, but I do look for any signal of organic demand — a waitlist, businesses that found the product on their own, a studio owner who tweeted about it. There's nothing. Both founders appear to be recent Dartmouth graduates, and while I've funded young founders successfully many times (Reddit's Huffman and Ohanian were 22), those founders were building something they personally wanted to use. I can't tell whether these founders would have built Booko if they hadn't decided to start a startup, and that distinction matters enormously. The absence of any public GitHub repositories from either founder also makes it hard to assess the technical depth — the product exists, but I can't evaluate the craft behind it.

This is a pass. The problem is real, the market structure creates an opening, and the founders are smart. But the idea feels like it was conceived in a brainstorming session rather than discovered through pain. The schlep is insufficient to deter well-resourced competitors. And at this stage, with no verifiable traction and no organic founder-problem connection, I'd be betting on an intellectual observation rather than a lived conviction. The best startups are built by people who can't stop working on a problem because it matters to them personally. I don't see that signal here.
