# CodeWisp -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most interesting tension in CodeWisp is between the founder's genuinely remarkable distribution asset and the modesty of the problem it's pointed at. Elvin Fu has taught 22 million people how to make games. He's Top 20 on Scratch out of 135 million users. He built two game engines from scratch. That is a rare distribution moat at pre-seed -- the kind of warm-start advantage capital alone cannot buy. But I keep asking myself: distribution into what? If CodeWisp succeeds completely -- if every person with a game idea can describe it in English and get a playable result -- the consequence is that more people make amateur 2D web games. That's a nice thing for the world. It is not a transformation of how the world works. Nobody's food system changes. No trillion-dollar industry becomes obsolete. The gaming industry continues with Unity and Unreal serving professionals, Roblox serving its 80 million daily users, and CodeWisp serving a tier of beginners making browser games. The ceiling of success here is a popular creative tool, not an industry disruption.

The commoditization problem is what kills this for me. The core technology -- generating game code from natural language prompts -- is a thin wrapper on capabilities that every major LLM provider is improving by the month. Rosebud AI already has 2.1 million games created. Moonlake AI has $28 million from Nvidia and Naval Ravikant with Stanford AI Lab researchers building multimodal reasoning models. Gambo, Sett, and a dozen vibe-coding platforms all converge on the same capability. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in public telecom was impossible -- the experts were dismissing it, not building it themselves. Here, the opposite is happening: everyone sees this market, everyone is building in it, and the incumbents (Unity, Epic) have the resources to add an "easy mode" AI tier to engines that already have millions of creators. When established players and well-funded startups all validate the approach, the innovation is typically incremental enough to be non-threatening to anyone. That's not the kind of bet I make.

Elvin Fu is a domain insider, not an outsider. He has spent 11 years in the Scratch community teaching beginners game development. His personal brand, his audience, his instincts all come from deep expertise in exactly this space. That's impressive execution ability, but it's the pattern I worry about most: "experience is a set of biases that prevent you from making mistakes but also prevents you from inventing." Fu knows precisely what beginner game developers want because he has been serving them for a decade. That knowledge will produce a well-designed product for an existing audience. It will not produce the kind of irreverent, foolish-confidence breakthrough that creates a new category. "Make game development easier" is the consensus view of 2025-2026 -- there is nothing contrarian about it.

The strongest bull case is that CodeWisp becomes the YouTube of games: a creator platform where the combination of AI generation, educational content, community features, and the founder's built-in audience creates a flywheel that competitors cannot replicate with money alone. If the community layer reaches critical mass -- if CodeWisp becomes where people go to both make and discover amateur games -- then the network effects could generate real defensibility regardless of how commodity the AI layer becomes. Fu's 22-million-student reach is a genuine unfair advantage for igniting that flywheel. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that (a) the community-and-distribution layer matters more than the AI-generation layer, (b) Fu can build a two-sided marketplace (creators and players) with enough engagement to sustain it, and (c) the amateur game creation market is large enough to support a venture-scale outcome even without disrupting professional game development. All three are plausible. None are the kind of consequence magnitude that makes me lose sleep thinking about the future if I miss this.

I keep coming back to my core question: if this succeeds, does it matter at a scale that justifies the effort of exceptional people? Fu is clearly talented -- 22 million students taught, two game engines built, Top 20 on one of the world's largest coding platforms. He's too talented to spend his career making it slightly easier for hobbyists to build browser games in a market where five well-funded competitors are doing the same thing. The probability of building a decent business here might be reasonable. But the consequence of that success is a modest platform in a crowded category. The ambition is miscalibrated to the founder's capability.
