# Travo -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here are four Stanford CS graduates -- one with a prior exit, one who worked at Wachtell Lipton (arguably the most selective law firm in America), one who built backend systems at Roblox, one who wrote satellite code -- and they've chosen to spend their careers building a data aggregation tool for RV park investors. I look at this team and the first thing I feel is frustration. These are exactly the kind of high-learning-rate technical athletes I want to back, and they've calibrated their ambition to fit inside a $10.9 billion niche industry where the addressable market for data services is a rounding error of that figure. They've found a corner of the world where CoStar and Reonomy don't bother to compete, and they're setting up shop there. That's not a signal of insight -- it's a signal of risk aversion dressed up as market selection.

Let me start where I always start: if Travo succeeds completely, what changes? Real estate PE firms and brokers who invest in RV parks can pull comps and zoning data faster. They save hours of manual county-record assembly. That's useful. It's also profoundly inconsequential. Nobody's life is transformed. No industry is disrupted. No incumbent is made structurally obsolete. The consequence of total success is a vertical SaaS data business serving a small pool of niche asset investors. I've spent four decades looking for companies where success means the world operates differently. A more convenient spreadsheet for RV park deal underwriting doesn't clear that bar by any measure.

The technology angle reinforces this assessment. The dossier itself states plainly that "the core technology stack (AI-powered data collection and aggregation) is not proprietary; competitors with engineering resources could build similar scrapers and models." This is LLM-powered web scraping applied to county records and listing sites. It's competent engineering, not disruption. When I backed Juniper Networks, Pradeep Sindhu was building a fundamentally new routing architecture that would make Cisco's approach uneconomic at scale -- that's technology creating structural displacement. Travo is automating a manual workflow. Any well-funded incumbent -- Altus with their $200M+ in resources, Cherre with $105M -- could replicate this data collection pipeline if niche asset classes became commercially interesting enough to justify it. The defensibility is a head start in data accumulation, not a technological moat. Head starts erode; architectural advantages compound.

The strongest bull case I can construct: RV parks are a wedge, not a ceiling. Institutional capital is flowing into alternative asset classes as mainstream CRE yields compress. Travo builds the data layer for everything the incumbents ignore -- mobile home parks, self-storage, marinas, car washes -- and becomes the platform of record for a $50B+ alternative real estate investment market. The fragmented data collection process creates a compounding data advantage that's expensive to replicate from scratch. In this scenario, Travo is to alternative real estate what Bloomberg was to fixed-income markets in the 1980s -- building the data infrastructure for a market that didn't know it needed one. I take this seriously as a possibility. But Bloomberg was creating price transparency in a $40 trillion bond market. Travo is creating property data for a collection of small, slow-growing niches (RV parks at 1.9% CAGR). The wedge-to-platform narrative requires each new asset class to have the same data fragmentation problem and the same collection methodology, which is unproven. And the founders haven't articulated this expansive vision publicly -- the positioning is "the most accurate and comprehensive real estate data set for RV parks," not "we're rebuilding real estate data infrastructure from the ground up."

What concerns me most is the absence of any contrarian thesis. The great investments in my career have all involved someone attempting what the consensus considered impossible or foolish. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, nobody thought a guy from New Zealand with no aerospace pedigree could build a commercially viable launch vehicle. When I backed Pat Brown, nobody thought you could make meat from plants that carnivores would eat. The experts actively dismissed these ideas, which was exactly my signal to lean in. Travo isn't being dismissed by anyone -- it's just being ignored, which is a different thing entirely. Building a better data product for an underserved niche is the kind of sensible, risk-managed approach that consultants recommend and I avoid. These founders have reduced their probability of failure to the point where success buys them a lifestyle business, not a transformation.

The team composition reflects this same pattern. Four Stanford CS undergrads is technically strong but homogeneous -- and critically, none of them have documented real estate experience. Their "gene pool" isn't engineered to address this venture's primary risk, which is domain expertise in niche commercial real estate data. Calafiura's legal background at Wachtell is relevant to transaction complexity, which is a partial fit. But the team reads as four smart generalists who found an underserved market, not a team assembled with surgical precision to attack a specific set of risks. I'd want to see someone who's actually underwritten RV park deals, someone who understands why the data is fragmented at a structural level, someone who knows which county assessor databases are reliable and which are garbage.

I'm passing. These founders are talented enough to attempt something where the consequence of success would justify their effort. RV park data aggregation is not that thing.
