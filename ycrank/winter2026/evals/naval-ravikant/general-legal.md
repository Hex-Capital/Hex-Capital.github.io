# General Legal -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The founders went from building the picks and shovels to working in the mine. Ryan Walker was CTO of Casetext -- a legal AI platform acquired by Thomson Reuters for $650M. JP Mohler bridged practicing law at Cooley with doing ML research at Casetext. Javed Qadrud-Din directed R&D on the same product. They co-authored academic papers on transformer-based legal text retrieval. These three people might be the most qualified team on Earth to build legal AI infrastructure -- the tools that every law firm in America will eventually need. Instead, they're building a law firm. That choice is the central puzzle of this evaluation.

The specific knowledge here is genuine and deep. Two Harvard Law JDs who practiced at the firms that wire Silicon Valley's cap tables -- Cooley, Fenwick & West -- combined with a PhD mathematician who shipped legal NLP products at production scale. Walker's open-source libraries, the arXiv paper, the $650M exit -- this isn't knowledge you acquire through career optimization. It emerges from years of obsessive work at the intersection of two fields that rarely intersect. A competitor trying to replicate this team would need attorneys who can write ML code and ML researchers who understand contract negotiation. That combination barely exists in the labor market. On specific knowledge alone, this team belongs in the top quartile of anything I've seen at YC.

But the leverage architecture is where I struggle. A law firm -- even one operating at 10x the efficiency of traditional attorneys -- is structurally a services business. Every $500 contract requires a U.S.-barred attorney to review, sign off, and negotiate. The AI makes the attorney faster, not unnecessary. This is the difference between Replit (where one engineer's code serves millions of users) and a consulting firm that gives its consultants better laptops. The multiplier is real, the leverage is not. At $500 per contract, even at extraordinary throughput, you're building a very efficient professional services firm -- not a platform where marginal cost approaches zero. Compare this to what the founders already built: Casetext was infrastructure. It sold tools to thousands of law firms simultaneously. That's leverage. General Legal sells attorney hours, faster. That's efficiency. In my framework, those are categorically different things.

The bull case deserves serious consideration. If General Legal achieves true 10x efficiency, a $500 contract that takes 20 minutes of attorney time yields an effective rate of $1,500/hour -- better than BigLaw partners bill. The Lawhive model validates AI-native law firms at scale ($35M revenue, $60M Series B). And this team uniquely understands that the value capture opportunity isn't in selling tools to law firms -- it's in being the firm and capturing both the technology margin and the service margin. Harvey sells AI to BigLaw; BigLaw keeps the profit. General Legal keeps it all. If they expand beyond commercial contracts into adjacent practice areas -- employment, IP, regulatory -- the revenue ceiling rises substantially. The YC network provides a warm distribution channel into exactly the customer segment they're targeting. And the regulatory barrier (licensed law firm status) prevents pure software companies from competing directly. The path to a $100M+ revenue business is plausible. But "plausible path to a large professional services firm" is not the same as "asymmetric upside from leverage."

The timing isn't contrarian -- it's consensus. Legal AI attracted $6B in funding in 2025. Harvey is valued at $8-11B. Lawhive just raised $60M. Two other YC W26 companies are building AI-native law firms in adjacent practice areas. When I invested in Uber at $4M, ride-sharing was illegal. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, serious people called it a Ponzi scheme. Nobody is dismissing legal AI in 2026. The specific angle -- being a law firm rather than selling to law firms -- has some novelty, but Lawhive already proved the model and is entering the U.S. market with a $100M+ war chest. I don't get paid for being right when everyone else is also right.

One small note: the YC page describes Javed as having "co-founded Casetext," while public sources show Jake Heller and Pablo Arredondo as co-founders with Javed joining five years later in 2018. This kind of credential inflation -- if that's what it is -- is exactly the behavioral tell I watch for. It may be an honest characterization of his role, but the discrepancy warrants a direct question.

I respect this team enormously. If they were building legal AI infrastructure -- the developer platform for law firms, the Alchemy of legal tech -- I'd be writing a check. The specific knowledge is extraordinary. But they chose to apply that knowledge to a business model that trades attorney time for money, faster. That's a good business. It might even be a great business. But it's not a leverage business. And I invest in leverage.
