# Didit -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Didit: identical twin brothers who've been programming together since they were twelve, competed on the tennis court together, crossed the Atlantic together, built a crypto company together, and then had the clarity to walk away from that whole Web3 identity and pivot into something real. The co-founder question -- the one that haunts me since HQ Trivia -- is answered before I even ask it. Alberto and Alejandro Rosas have been resolving conflict their entire lives, not just as business partners but as brothers sharing a face. I've said I have a preference for family-run businesses because the conflict resolution is already built in. This is the most extreme version of that I've encountered. They survived a token launch, a metaverse pivot, and a complete business model reinvention together. That's a relationship that's been pressure-tested in ways most co-founders never experience.

But when I ask my first question -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- I'm listening for something specific. I want to hear the biographical thread that makes this problem *theirs*. With the Crusoe founders, it was waste gas and physics and an insight nobody else could see. With Travis at Uber, it was years of obsession with the taxi medallion racket. Here, the story I hear is: two mathematicians from Barcelona who built a crypto project, recognized the identity verification problem inside it, and pivoted to attack a $14 billion market with lower prices. That's smart. That's adaptive. But it's not the kind of personal, bone-deep connection to the problem that makes me believe someone will keep going when everything falls apart. There's no moment where identity verification became personal -- no experience with fraud that changed their lives, no family member locked out of financial services, no system they watched fail someone they loved. The pivot reads as strategic opportunity recognition, and while I respect that, it's not the signal I'm calibrated to detect.

The honest assessment of the market position is that this is a well-understood category with well-funded incumbents executing a well-understood disruption playbook. Persona has raised $418 million. Sumsub is doing $85 million in revenue. Veriff is a unicorn. Onfido got acquired for $650 million. Didit's play -- make it cheaper, offer a free tier, make integration faster -- is the Stripe playbook applied to KYC. It's smart. It works. But it's not the kind of bet that makes other investors uncomfortable. Nobody at a partner meeting is going to say "you want to invest in cheaper identity verification?" the way they said "you want to invest in mining Bitcoin on gas flares?" This is consensus territory dressed in insurgent pricing, and the companies I've done best with -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- were the ones that looked genuinely ridiculous to everyone else at the time.

What I *do* notice, and what a typical analyst might underweight, is the economic access dimension. A free tier of 500 KYC checks per month doesn't just undercut Sumsub's $149 minimum -- it opens the door for small fintechs in Latin America, African mobile money startups, and crypto projects in Southeast Asia that literally cannot afford enterprise KYC. The Head of Sales for LATAM, the customers named Adelantos and TucanPay and CrediDemo -- these are companies serving populations that legacy KYC providers have priced out of the compliance market. When compliance is too expensive, businesses either skip it (creating risk) or don't launch (destroying economic opportunity). Didit making identity verification essentially free for small operators could genuinely expand who gets to participate in regulated financial services. That resonates with the same thing I saw in Affirm and Uber -- infrastructure that creates economic access where cost or complexity previously blocked it.

The traction deserves respect on its own terms: 700+ active B2B customers, 20% month-over-month growth, 300%+ net revenue retention, and approaching profitability on just $2 million raised. That's remarkable capital efficiency. If I were evaluating purely on execution metrics, this would score higher. But my framework starts with the founder's story and works outward, and the strongest version of the bull case would require me to believe that the commoditization risk in core KYC technology (OCR, biometrics, liveness) won't erode their pricing advantage, that the crypto/Gamium history won't create enterprise sales friction, and that two founders whose deepest domain experience is in blockchain identity can outmaneuver teams with decades of compliance and regulatory expertise. The free tier is bold, but pricing moats are the easiest to match once an incumbent decides to compete -- and when Persona or Sumsub decides to offer a free tier, Didit's primary differentiation evaporates. I'd need to see proprietary technology or network effects that go beyond price, and right now the reusable KYC feature is a potential network effect, not an actual one.

I respect the execution here, and the twin founders have exactly the kind of co-founder resilience I wish every company had. But this is a competitive, well-understood market where the founders' connection to the problem is strategic rather than personal, and the differentiation is primarily on price in a space where the underlying technology is commoditizing. It doesn't give me that jolt -- that feeling I had with Niantic or Crusoe where I could see the full shape of something nobody else was imagining yet. What I see here is solid operators building a real business in a real market, and that's valuable, but it's not where I write my best checks.
