# Pollen -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Two YC batches in a row with two completely different products. That's the fact I can't get past. In Summer 2025, this team was building Daymi, a consumer AI clone for iMessage. Then Noah Yin posted on LinkedIn that they "pivoted our company the day after graduating UC Berkeley," and suddenly they're building AI agents for customer success. When I see a team switch from consumer messaging to B2B customer success in the span of months, I have to ask the question that matters most: how did they find this problem? And the answer is clear -- they didn't find it. They went looking for it. This is the failure mode I've written about extensively. Smart, capable engineers who need a new idea sit down and think "what's a big market where AI agents could work?" Customer success is a reasonable answer to that question. But the question itself is wrong. The best startup ideas are discovered, not selected.

The schlep test doesn't help Pollen either, because customer success software isn't a schlep-blindness opportunity. Schlep blindness works when everyone knows a problem is painful but unconsciously avoids it because the work is ugly -- regulatory filings, banking integrations, dealing with strangers sleeping in your apartment. Customer success monitoring isn't like that. It's a well-mapped market with four established players doing $180-200M in annual revenue each. Gainsight, Totango, ChurnZero, Vitally -- they all exist, they all have customer relationships, and they're all shipping AI features right now. Pollen's thesis is that an "agent-first" architecture beats incumbents who are bolting AI onto legacy dashboards. That may even be true architecturally. But when the incumbents already have the customer data, the integrations, and the trust required to access sensitive email and CRM systems, the architectural advantage has to be overwhelming to overcome the distribution disadvantage. And "we use LLMs natively instead of as an add-on" is not the kind of moat that compounds.

The strongest bull case is that these are three technical co-founders from Berkeley who've shipped a product, gotten into YC twice, and can build fast. Aldrin Ong has real GenAI experience from AWS and a prior startup (Trainme). The team clearly has the raw engineering talent. If the customer success market is genuinely ready for an AI-native replacement -- if mid-market SaaS companies would rather have an autonomous agent than configure playbooks in Gainsight -- then a fast-moving technical team could capture that segment before incumbents adapt. There's also a version of this where the pivot itself is a positive signal: they recognized Daymi wasn't working, killed it quickly, and moved to something with clearer B2B economics. That's the rational read. I've funded founders who pivoted before -- Justin.tv started as a lifecasting webcam and became Twitch. But the pivots that work tend to have a connecting thread. Shear and Kan pivoted within live video. These founders pivoted from consumer AI messaging to enterprise customer success. There's no thread connecting those except "AI" -- and that's a technology label, not a problem domain.

What concerns me most is the combination of no domain expertise and a crowded, well-funded competitive field. None of the three founders appear to have worked in customer success, managed accounts, or experienced churn pain firsthand. They're building for a buyer persona they haven't been. When Drew Houston built Dropbox, he'd been the frustrated user for years. When the Collisons built Stripe, they'd been the frustrated developer for years. Who on this team has been the frustrated CSM? Nobody, as far as I can tell. In a greenfield market, that might be overcome by technical brilliance alone. But in a market where ChurnZero already has $180M in revenue and is purpose-built for mid-market CS teams, you need deep domain intuition to know where the incumbents are weakest. You need to have felt the specific pain of checking twelve dashboards at 7am to see which accounts are at risk. You can't brainstorm your way to that understanding.

The technical talent is real. Three Berkeley CS founders who've all interned at Amazon, who can clearly build software, and who've already shipped one product to launch. If they'd arrived with this same team working on a problem one of them had personally lived with for two years -- something ugly that nobody wanted to touch -- I'd be interested. The founders have the raw ingredients. But the idea has no organic backstory, the market is crowded with resourceful incumbents, and there's zero evidence yet that anyone wants what they're building. I'm passing.
