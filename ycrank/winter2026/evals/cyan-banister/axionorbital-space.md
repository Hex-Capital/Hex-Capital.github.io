# AxionOrbital Space -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about AxionOrbital is the pivot. Four months before YC W26, Dhenenjay was building a no-code geospatial IDE — a developer tool for satellite data. Now it's ORION, a foundation model that translates radar backscatter into photorealistic optical imagery. Those are different companies. The GitHub stars, the hackathon win, the Character Capital accelerator — all of that belongs to the old product. The thing they're pitching today has zero market validation that I can find. When I backed Crusoe, those founders had been obsessing over stranded gas for years before I met them. The insight had calcified into conviction through lived experience. Here, I see talented people who identified a genuine technical gap and repositioned to capture it, and there's a difference between discovering a problem through obsession and discovering it through market analysis.

If I could sit down with Dhenenjay, I'd ask him: how did you get from ISRO to a no-code IDE to a SAR-to-optical foundation model in under two years? Not the business logic — the personal thread. Because his background is genuinely relevant: ML engineering at India's space agency puts him in a rare club of people who've actually worked with satellite data pipelines. That matters. Atharva's credentials are remarkable — a PhD at CU Boulder, research at Harvard's Visual Computing Group, two-time Microsoft Imagine Cup world finalist. These are clearly capable people. But capability and conviction are different currencies at the stage I invest. I'm looking for the founder whose biography makes the problem inevitable, not merely logical. The career path here reads as a talented generalist (VC stints at three different firms, an agritech startup, esports) converging on a smart opportunity. That's fine for many investors. It's not how I pick.

The co-founder timing genuinely worries me. As of September 2025, every public reference describes Dhenenjay as a solo founder. Atharva appears to have joined sometime in the subsequent three to five months — likely to strengthen the YC application with deep CV research credentials. I learned the hard way with HQ Trivia that co-founder dynamics are not something you can paper over with complementary skill sets. A relationship forged in the crucible of a YC application sprint hasn't been through the kind of crisis that reveals whether two people can actually build together for a decade. I don't know how they argue. I don't know who makes the final call. I don't know if they've even disagreed yet on something that matters. That's not a dealbreaker at every stage, but it's a real gap in my evaluation framework.

Now let me steel-man this, because the structural positioning is legitimately interesting and hits one of my patterns — making invisible systems visible. SAR backscatter is literally incomprehensible to the human eye. Translating it into optical imagery that any analyst can read is the same kind of transparency play I've backed with Carta and Flock Safety. The competitive dynamics are favorable: optical satellite companies like Planet can't build this tool without admitting their own data is weather-dependent, and SAR operators like ICEYE are hardware companies that think in orbits, not neural architectures. If ORION works as claimed — real-time, deterministic, physics-grounded — it becomes the software layer that the entire SAR ecosystem routes through. That's a genuine infrastructure play at a real inflection point. I've backed those before, even when they don't fit my "scrappy outsider" narrative. The convergence of expanding SAR constellations, diffusion model breakthroughs, and geopolitical demand for persistent surveillance creates a legitimate "why now." For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that the team can build trust with defense procurement (a multi-year process), that SAR operators won't build this themselves (ICEYE has the resources), and that the SSIM score of 0.60 can be pushed high enough for operational confidence. Those are big "ifs," but they're not impossible.

What ultimately keeps me from writing a check is the absence of the signal I trust most. I don't feel the biographical inevitability — the sense that these founders couldn't NOT work on this problem. The primary customers are defense agencies and commodity traders, not underserved populations gaining access to something previously denied them. The disaster response angle has humanitarian potential, but it's listed as a secondary market, not the animating mission. And "AI for satellite imagery" in 2026 isn't the kind of widely-dismissed, magically weird category where I find my best returns — it's an increasingly funded space where ICEYE alone has raised $686 million. I respect the technical ambition and the founders' credentials. But my best investments have always started with a story that made the hair on my arms stand up, and I'm not feeling that here.
