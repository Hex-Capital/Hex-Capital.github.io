# OctaPulse -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first thing I notice about OctaPulse is that it has company. Tidal spun out of Google X with 30 billion data points across 50 million fish. Aquabyte raised $46 million before being acquired. Aquaticode in Norway has $6 million in funding, a database of over 3 million labeled images, and can already scan 10,000 fish per hour using AI phenotyping -- the exact capability OctaPulse is building. When I see multiple well-funded players converging on the same thesis from slightly different angles, I see a Girardian convergence: companies imitating each other into increasingly precise replicas of one another, each burning capital to differentiate on dimensions -- salmon versus trout, grow-out versus hatchery, Europe versus the U.S. -- that will erode within two product cycles. The question I always ask is: what is the secret here? And the answer, uncomfortably, is that there is no secret. "Aquaculture needs computer vision for quality assurance" is not a truth that most intelligent people reject. It is a truth that multiple venture-backed companies, a Google X spinout, and an entire market research segment valued at $640 million already affirm. When everyone agrees the opportunity is real, no one earns monopoly returns.

OctaPulse's positioning choice -- entering at the hatchery stage rather than grow-out pens -- is tactically interesting but does not constitute a contrarian insight. It is a go-to-market wedge, the kind of segment selection that a good McKinsey engagement would produce. No one disputes that hatchery phenotyping matters; the grow-out players simply chose a different entry point first. Aquaticode is already doing AI phenotyping in European hatcheries and expanding into bass and bream. Tidal, with its Google Cloud infrastructure and 700+ pen installations, could move upstream into hatchery QA in twelve months if the margin justified it. The boundary between "hatchery AI" and "grow-out AI" is a product feature, not a structural moat. A founder with a genuine secret would be able to articulate why this particular truth is rejected by experts. The OctaPulse thesis -- that off-the-shelf cameras and computer vision can automate manual fish inspection -- is something that every aquaculture technology investor in the world would agree with today.

The founding team raises a separate concern. Paul Grech is a CMU Tepper MBA who was previously a UX project manager at Bloomberg. Rohan Singh is an engineering student with internship experience at ASML, Toyota, Tesla, and NVIDIA. These are perfectly good credentials for a pre-seed team, but they are the credentials of capable generalists, not domain obsessives. Neither founder has documented aquaculture experience. The company originated from Grech's stated passion for ocean conservation combined with CMU's robotics capabilities -- which is exactly the kind of university project origin that produces competent applications of known technology to underserved verticals, not the kind of founder-market fusion that produces monopolies. When I backed Zuckerberg, he had been building social software since high school and understood network effects at a level that older, more experienced investors did not. When I co-founded Palantir, the founding team included former intelligence community members who understood the specific data integration problems of counterterrorism. Domain conviction at the founder level matters because it is the foundation of definite optimism -- the ability to articulate a specific future and refuse to deviate from it. I see no evidence that these founders possess that kind of domain-forged conviction. Their vision of becoming "the brain for future autonomous aquafarms" is aspirational language, not a definite plan.

The strongest bull case for OctaPulse runs through the Stripe analogy: start with a narrow, unglamorous infrastructure problem (hatchery QA), own the data layer, and expand concentrically into the full aquaculture stack -- feeding optimization, health monitoring, processing, genetics. If OctaPulse's multi-species dataset genuinely generalizes better than competitors' species-specific models, the data moat compounds with each deployment, and the company becomes the default operating system for hatcheries worldwide. The six-figure paid pilot with Riverence -- the largest U.S. trout producer -- at pre-seed is a real signal; most pre-seed companies cannot point to a named enterprise customer paying six figures. And the 10x speed improvement from five minutes to thirty seconds per fish is a genuine order-of-magnitude gain on that dimension. If I believed the hatchery data position were structurally defensible -- that is, if Aquaticode's 3 million images and Tidal's 30 billion data points could not be redirected upstream -- the beachhead strategy would be compelling. But I do not believe that boundary holds. Computer vision for biological inspection is a known technical approach; the barrier is labeled data, not algorithmic novelty, and a well-resourced competitor with existing farm relationships can build a comparable dataset in eighteen months.

The technology itself is competent application, not discontinuity. Off-the-shelf cameras running computer vision models for biological inspection is a well-understood paradigm -- it exists in agricultural crop inspection, poultry processing, and pharmaceutical quality control. OctaPulse is applying this paradigm to a new vertical, which is valuable but is definitionally a 1-to-n move, not a 0-to-1 creation. The 90-95% accuracy figure is solid but not a structural barrier; accuracy is a function of training data, and Aquaticode already has a multi-million-image head start. Nothing in the technical approach suggests a proprietary breakthrough that would be difficult for a funded competitor to replicate. This is the cleantech pattern I have warned about: companies entering a sector with consensus tailwinds (aquaculture growth, sustainability pressure), applying known technology with incremental improvements, and competing in a market where multiple players share the same thesis. The result is margin compression, not monopoly.

I pass on OctaPulse. The company has reasonable execution at pre-seed -- a paying enterprise customer, a 10x speed improvement, a sensible beachhead -- but it lacks the foundational element I require: a secret that creates a structural path to monopoly. When the thesis is consensus, the technology is replicable, the competitive landscape is crowded, and the founders are talented generalists rather than domain visionaries, the expected outcome is a decent small business or an acqui-hire, not the kind of power-law return that justifies an angel check. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. OctaPulse has not yet demonstrated how it escapes.
