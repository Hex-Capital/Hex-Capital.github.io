# Shofo -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I'd want to know about these founders is how four college-age engineers ended up caring deeply about video data labeling for AI labs -- and honestly, I can't find that story anywhere. What I see is a team that built a consumer AI search product called Correkt, got it to 40,000 users, and then pivoted to video data infrastructure because the market is hot. That pivot trajectory tells me something important: they're talented builders searching for a problem to match their skills, not founders who woke up every morning haunted by a specific pain they lived through. When I backed Crusoe Energy, the founders had independently arrived at an insight about stranded gas that came from understanding energy waste at a molecular level -- it was biographical. When I think about Uber, Scott and I had been ranting about the taxi medallion racket for years before Travis showed up. With Shofo, I see smart young people following signal, and there's a difference between following signal and generating it from your bones.

The "Common Crawl for Video" framing is clean and legible, which is actually part of my concern. Every AI investor immediately understands why video training data matters. The multimodal model explosion, the Scale AI neutrality crisis after Meta's acquisition -- these are consensus observations. I'm supposed to get excited about companies that most investors find confusing, unpopular, or outright bizarre. Shofo is the opposite: it's the kind of pitch that makes a room nod along. Nobody's going to tell these founders they're crazy. And when nobody tells you you're crazy, in my experience, the pricing is already wrong and the competitive window is narrower than it looks.

That said, I want to be honest about the bull case, because the structural opening here is real and worth engaging with seriously. Meta buying 49% of Scale AI is a genuine inflection point -- the dominant data labeling platform just lost its neutrality, and Google and OpenAI are actively looking for alternatives. If Shofo can move fast during this window and lock in even two or three major AI lab relationships, the data asset they accumulate -- the labeled index, the annotation taxonomies, the quality feedback loops -- could compound into something defensible. The "Common Crawl for Video" analogy is instructive because Common Crawl itself became quietly essential infrastructure for the entire text-based AI revolution. If video AI follows the same trajectory, and if Shofo is the team that builds the canonical index first, this could be a much bigger outcome than it appears today. The bundling of data sourcing with annotation is also a real product insight -- Scale AI, Labelbox, and Encord label data you bring them; Shofo is both the library and the librarian.

But I keep running into the same wall: what stops a well-funded competitor from building this? The dossier itself acknowledges that "the barrier is the time and cost of building and maintaining a comprehensive, clean video index at scale, not fundamental technical complexity." That's execution moat, not technology moat. Scale AI has 6,000 employees and $870 million in revenue -- if they decide video indexing matters, they can build it in months. And the legal exposure around scraping social platforms is substantial and unresolved. These founders have no evident legal or regulatory expertise to navigate the copyright and terms-of-service questions that are central to their business model. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in the regulatory weeds of FDA pathways -- the complexity was the moat. Here, the legal complexity feels more like a liability the team hasn't fully reckoned with.

On the co-founder dynamics, I see some positive signal: three of four founders built Correkt together at UCSB, survived a pivot, and are still working together. That counts for something. But four co-founders is a lot of people to align, especially when Bryan Hong appears to have joined later and wasn't part of the original founding story. I'd want to understand the decision-making structure and equity split before writing a check. My HQ Trivia lesson sits heavy with me -- even when the timing and product are perfect, unresolved founder dynamics will kill you.

This is a pass for me. Not because the team isn't capable -- they clearly are. They shipped a product to 40,000 users as undergrads, they're in YC, and they've identified a real market need at a moment of structural disruption. But my framework starts with the founder's story, and I can't find the story here. I'm looking for the biographical thread that makes this founder the only person who could solve this problem, and instead I see talented generalists who pivoted into a hot category. The idea isn't weird enough, the moat isn't deep enough, and the company doesn't create economic access for anyone who needs it -- it serves the wealthiest organizations in technology. I wish them well, but this isn't my kind of bet.
