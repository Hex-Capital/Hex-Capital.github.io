# CellType -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about CellType: this is an incredibly credentialed company that every sophisticated investor in the room already wants. Google CEO Sundar Pichai personally amplified the founders' research to seven million people. The core technology was co-developed with Google DeepMind. They claim 100% inbound deal generation from Top 10 pharma. They published at ICML. And that constellation of signals -- the consensus validation, the institutional backing, the oversubscribed attention -- is precisely what makes me step back rather than lean in. In my experience, the most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. CellType is extremely popular and, on the surface, remarkably easy to assess. When the validation machinery is running this hot before a company has even left YC, the weirdness has already been priced in.

The part of my process that matters most -- the founder's personal story, the biographical thread connecting this person to this problem -- is where I find the least signal. David van Dijk is a brilliant computational biologist. 8,895 citations. Creator of MAGIC and PHATE. NSF CAREER Award. Associate Professor at Yale. He turned down Google to build CellType, which tells me something about commitment. But when I ask myself the question I always start with -- "Tell me your story, not the business" -- what I hear is academic excellence, not the kind of lived-experience connection that tells me this founder will walk through walls when things get brutal. I don't see evidence that either founder has a personal relationship with drug discovery failure, with illness, with watching the healthcare system fail someone they love. The insight that single-cell data could be converted into language for LLMs to reason about is technically elegant and genuinely clever. But it's an intellectual insight arrived at through research, not a problem that kept someone up at night because it was personal. Ivan Vrkic built software for CERN's Large Hadron Collider, which is impressive engineering, but it's a different kind of fire than the biographical grit I weight most heavily.

The bull case deserves real engagement, because it's strong. Cell2Sentence -- converting cellular biology into natural language sequences -- is a genuinely novel technical insight that sits at a different level than what competitors are doing. Isomorphic Labs works with protein structure. Recursion does phenomic screening on cell images. Insilico Medicine runs end-to-end molecular pipelines. CellType is doing something distinct: teaching LLMs to reason natively about cellular states. If that foundational approach proves out, it could become infrastructure that everyone else builds on, not just another drug discovery tool. The Google DeepMind collaboration at this stage is extraordinary -- it gives them compute, credibility, and distribution that would take other startups years to earn. And 4,000+ drugs screened with a validated cancer treatment signal is real preliminary evidence. If van Dijk turns out to be the rare academic who also has the operational intensity to build a company, and if the agentic pipeline on top of the open-source foundation creates a genuine moat, this could be the kind of infrastructure play where I'd override my usual heuristics -- the way I did with SpaceX.

But here's where my pattern recognition pulls me back: the core methodology is published and the models are on Hugging Face. The company's biggest competitive threat isn't some scrappy startup -- it's Google DeepMind itself, through Isomorphic Labs, which has $600 million and hired the team that built AlphaFold. CellType literally co-developed their technology with the parent company of their most formidable competitor. That's a structural dependency that makes me deeply uncomfortable. And I don't see this company making invisible systems visible for people who lack economic access. This is a platform for the ten richest pharmaceutical companies on earth. Any patient benefit is years and multiple abstraction layers away. I invest in things that create economic opportunity where it doesn't currently exist -- Uber for drivers, Affirm for borrowers, Thumbtack for tradespeople. CellType creates value for pharma R&D teams. That's a fine business, but it doesn't activate the part of my thesis about positive-sum economic outcomes.

On the co-founder dynamic, I notice something specific: this is an advisor-trainee relationship. Van Dijk is the tenured professor; Vrkic is his postgraduate associate. That's a power asymmetry that I want to understand before investing, because the stresses of building a company have a way of surfacing unresolved dynamics. They co-published together, which is good -- they have shared intellectual output. But I'd want to know how they disagree, who makes the final call on non-technical decisions, and whether Vrkic has the standing to push back on his former advisor when the company requires it. Two people with no commercial leadership hires yet, transitioning from academic research to enterprise pharma sales -- that's a real gap.

I respect what van Dijk has built in the research world, and the technical novelty of Cell2Sentence is real. But my whole framework is designed to find misfits and free-thinking people before consensus forms -- and CellType has already been blessed by Google, validated at ICML, amplified by one of the most powerful CEOs in tech, and is fielding inbound interest from the largest pharma companies on the planet. That's not my kind of bet. My kind of bet is the founder who's been told no fifty times and keeps going, building something that looks ridiculous to everyone except the few people who can see it.
