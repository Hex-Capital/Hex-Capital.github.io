# 1code (21st.dev) -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to: AI coding tools might be the single most consensus category in technology right now. Cursor hit a billion dollars in annual revenue in about two years. Every major AI lab is building coding agents. Every developer tool startup is adding AI features. And 1code is building a visual wrapper on top of Claude Code and OpenAI Codex -- the two platforms that have every incentive and every capability to build exactly this themselves. OpenAI already launched its own Codex app with multi-agent orchestration in February 2026. When I think about the investments that have defined my career -- SpaceX when people said private rockets were delusional, Uber when ride-sharing was literally illegal, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded unhinged -- the common thread is that nobody else wanted to be there. With 1code, everybody wants to be here. That's the opposite of the signal I've trained myself to follow over a hundred-plus investments.

I want to understand these founders' stories, not the product, and what I can piece together tells me something specific. Sergey Bunas is from Tajikistan, was the first person from his country accepted to Y Combinator at nineteen years old, won a Cambridge hackathon solo, and built multiple products with paying users before joining Deel as a senior engineer. That's a real outsider arc -- someone who taught himself to build things from a place where the infrastructure to do so barely existed. I respect that deeply, and it resonates with parts of my own path. But when I look at what's driving the team toward THIS problem, I see nine products shipped in ten months. That velocity is impressive as a craft, but it tells me these founders are extraordinary builders chasing opportunity, not people who lived through a specific pain and couldn't stop themselves from solving it. The biographical thread connects to "I can build anything fast" -- not "I have to build this because I understand this problem in my bones." When I backed the Contraline founder, he'd spent years in academic obscurity researching male contraception because nobody else would. When Travis pitched me on Uber, the obsession with the taxi medallion racket predated the company by years. I don't see that biographical inevitability here.

The defensibility question is where this falls apart for my framework. I look for moats as one of the very first things -- regulatory complexity, network effects, data advantages, something that makes the company hard to replicate. A visual orchestration layer around CLI coding agents is technically reproducible by a talented team in weeks. The open-source community (5,000 stars) provides some switching costs if developers build workflows around 1code's automation features, but that's fragile when the underlying platforms can absorb those features into their own products at any moment. Anthropic could ship a Claude Code desktop app tomorrow. The automation layer -- PR reviews, Linear integration, CI/CD fixes -- is more differentiated, but it's also the kind of feature set that Cursor, OpenHands, or any well-funded competitor can build. This isn't a hard space. There's no regulatory moat, no stigma deterring competitors, no capital-intensive infrastructure creating barriers. It's a feature race in the most competitive corner of developer tools.

Let me steelman the case, because I owe that to any founder who ships this fast. If the AI coding market fragments rather than consolidates -- if developers end up using five different agents for different tasks rather than one IDE to rule them all -- then an agent-agnostic orchestration layer becomes genuinely valuable infrastructure. The team has demonstrated they can build and launch at a pace that rivals anyone in the YC batch. Sergey's engineering depth at Deel and his track record of products that gain real users gives me confidence they can execute technically. And if the $200K revenue figure is even partially attributable to 1code, that's meaningful at pre-seed. The architectural bet that developers will use standalone CLI agents rather than IDE-embedded ones is a legitimate contrarian position within the AI coding space. If Cursor's IDE model proves too opinionated and developers want to mix and match agents, 1code is well-positioned. But "well-positioned in the hottest market" is not the same as "building something nobody else sees yet," and it's the latter that gets me to write a check from my own money.

I also notice there's nothing here about economic access or making invisible systems visible. This is productivity tooling for software engineers who are already among the highest-paid knowledge workers on the planet. It doesn't create income for people who need it, doesn't bring transparency to an opaque system, doesn't open doors for underserved communities. I'm not saying every company needs to do that, but it's a significant part of why I invest, and its absence means one of my core motivations isn't activated. When I think about how Uber created economic opportunity for drivers, or how Affirm replaced hidden credit card fees with transparent rates, or how Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that had none -- those are the companies that make me feel something. Developer orchestration tooling for AI agents doesn't generate that same pull.

The co-founder dynamic is a question mark. I can't find evidence of how Serafim and Sergey met, or how long they've worked together before these nine products. They clearly can build together at speed, which is a positive signal. But I haven't seen evidence they've been through a real crisis together -- a funding gap, a product failure, a disagreement about direction that threatened to split them. Nine products in ten months is a lot of building, but it's also a lot of pivoting, and I wonder what happens when one of them wants to pivot and the other wants to stay.
