# Didit -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Didit is the pivot. The founders started in blockchain identity within a metaverse venture called Gamium, complete with a crypto token launched in 2022. Now they sell B2B KYC software. That's a dramatic shift, and it could mean one of two things. Either these are founders who chase whatever's fundable -- metaverse when metaverse was hot, AI identity verification when that's hot -- or these are founders who were working in the identity neighborhood and organically discovered where the real pain was. The evidence suggests the latter. When you're building identity infrastructure for blockchain and you keep running into the ugly reality of verifying actual humans -- document types, biometric fraud, AML regulations -- you've found a harder, more important problem than the one you started with. That's the Justin.tv pattern. Shear and Kan started with lifecasting, discovered game streaming by proximity, and that became Twitch. The pivot wasn't abandonment; it was discovery.

The schlep here is real but not invisible. Identity verification involves navigating 14,000+ document types across 220 countries, maintaining ISO 27001/27017/27018 certifications, building liveness detection that defeats deepfakes, and staying current with evolving regulations across every jurisdiction you serve. That's genuinely tedious work. But this isn't the kind of schlep blindness I wrote about with Stripe, where an obvious problem sat untouched for a decade because everyone unconsciously avoided the banking complexity. Identity verification is a well-known market with well-funded incumbents. Persona has raised $418M. Veriff hit unicorn status. Onfido was acquired for $650M. Nobody is unconsciously avoiding this problem -- they're actively building solutions for it. What Didit has found isn't a hidden problem. It's a hidden pricing model.

And that pricing insight is where this gets interesting. The incumbents -- Sumsub at $1.35 per verification with a $149 monthly minimum, Persona oriented toward enterprise -- have cost structures built around large sales teams and long contracts. Didit offers 500 free KYC checks per month, self-serve signup, and pay-per-success pricing starting at $0.03. This is the Stripe playbook applied to identity: make the product radically cheaper and easier to start with, then grow with your customers. The 300%+ net revenue retention at month six tells you the wedge is working. Customers come in on the free tier or cheap plan and expand rapidly as their verification volumes grow. That's genuine economic pull, not vanity metrics.

The traction numbers deserve serious attention. Seven hundred active B2B customers growing at roughly 20% month over month. Close to profitability on just $2M raised with twelve people. For context, Sumsub does $85M in revenue and Veriff does $42M, but both have raised far more capital. Didit's capital efficiency is exceptional. Getting near breakeven this fast on this little money means the founders understand something about unit economics that matters -- they're default alive or close to it, which transforms the entire dynamic of the company. They're not playing the game of "raise more before we die." They're playing the game of "grow while sustaining ourselves," which is far more dangerous for incumbents.

The twin founders have been programming together since they were twelve years old. That's one of the strongest co-founder relationships I've seen -- they've had decades to develop the trust and communication patterns that matter under pressure. Alberto's GitHub shows real ML capability (a StyleGAN2 implementation with 143 stars), and both have mathematics backgrounds relevant to building the core verification algorithms. They built the product with a small team, which is exactly what I want to see. The crypto token history is a legitimate enterprise sales concern, though -- a compliance officer at a bank discovering that their KYC vendor once launched a memecoin-adjacent token is not a conversation any sales team wants to have.

My main hesitation is that this is a pricing disruption in a crowded market, not a fundamental insight that creates a structural moat. The core technology -- OCR, facial recognition, liveness detection -- is commoditizing as AI inference costs drop. What stops Sumsub or Persona from offering their own free tier once they see Didit gaining traction? The answer might be that their business models can't absorb it -- matching a free tier would cannibalize existing contracts -- which is exactly the kind of structural advantage that works until it doesn't. If Didit grows fast enough, the network effect from reusable KYC credentials could create genuine lock-in. But that network effect is still theoretical.

The bull case is compelling. If those NRR numbers hold and customer growth continues at 20% monthly, Didit reaches meaningful revenue within a year while remaining capital efficient. They're doing to identity verification what Stripe did to payments: making it simple, cheap, and developer-friendly, then growing with the long tail of businesses that incumbents can't profitably serve. The fact that they're near profitability on $2M means they have time to build the moat before the incumbents react. I'd invest, though my conviction is moderate. The traction earns the check. The question is whether pricing alone creates enough distance from well-funded competitors who are already building similar products.
