# Inviscid AI -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the multi-miracle problem. To succeed, Inviscid AI needs to: (1) productize physics-informed neural networks for real-time building CFD at enterprise reliability, (2) acquire the building science and HVAC engineering expertise neither founder currently has, (3) integrate with legacy BMS protocols like BACnet and Modbus that require specialized domain knowledge, and (4) close enterprise facilities deals as a two-person team against incumbents with global sales forces. That's four sequential low-probability events. When I see a plan that requires compounding breakthroughs across technical, domain, distribution, and integration dimensions simultaneously, I pass. The math doesn't work -- each one is achievable individually, but the joint probability collapses.

The market itself doesn't fit the "non-obvious at a structural inflection" pattern I look for. HVAC optimization isn't overlooked -- it's a well-identified category where PassiveLogic has raised $125M+ and is already doing $15M in annual revenue with physics-based digital twins, where BrainBox AI got acquired by Trane Technologies in December 2024 for global distribution access, where 75F has 1,800+ deployments across nine countries, and where PhysicsX has raised ~$170M applying the same physics-AI techniques more broadly. When PagerDuty seemed boring, there was no PagerDuty. Here, the market has been discovered, funded, and partially consolidated. The data center cooling angle is the strongest structural argument -- AI compute demand has genuinely created an urgent, high-value customer segment where cooling is 30-40% of energy costs. But that's a consensus observation now. Every building-tech investor I know is talking about data center cooling. The "why now" the dossier articulates is almost entirely inferred, and the core technology -- PINNs based on Raissi et al., 2019 -- has been available for six years. That's not an inflection point; that's a gradual maturation.

The founder profile compounds my concern. Kabir Jain is a 19-year-old NUS High School student with an IOAI gold medal -- genuinely impressive AI competition credentials. Ziming Qiu is a PhD candidate at NYU working on computer vision and medical image segmentation. Between them, they have strong ML capability. But neither has any documented experience in building science, HVAC engineering, facilities management, or enterprise building operations. The people buying this product are facilities directors who've spent 20 years optimizing chiller plants and air handling units. They speak in terms of psychrometric charts, enthalpy calculations, and supply air temperature setpoints. The credibility gap between "AI competition winner" and "person who understands my building" is a real obstacle in enterprise sales, especially when your competitors have both the AI and the domain expertise. The case studies on the website reinforce this concern -- they span HVAC vent optimization, coastal infrastructure stress analysis, and storm surge forecasting. That's three different domains, which reads as academic demonstrations repurposed for a commercial narrative rather than deep product-market fit work in buildings specifically.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things: (1) that data center cooling is a segment-within-a-segment where physics-based simulation provides a genuinely discontinuous advantage over data-driven approaches, because new data center configurations create novel thermal conditions with no historical training data; (2) that the team's raw AI talent can close the domain expertise gap fast enough to build credible products before well-funded competitors lock up the market; and (3) that the physics-informed approach creates switching costs through per-building digital twins that accumulate proprietary calibration data. If all three of those are true, the company could carve out a defensible wedge in a growing market. The data center cooling thesis specifically is compelling -- when hyperscalers are spending billions on new facilities with novel cooling architectures, a physics-first simulation tool that can model conditions that have never existed before has a genuine edge over pattern-matching approaches. But this bull case itself requires multiple things to be true simultaneously, and it's speculative against the evidence of a team that hasn't yet demonstrated the domain depth to execute on it.

On the product-to-distribution dimension, there's theoretical potential -- a digital twin of a building is a relationship that could expand from HVAC optimization to equipment maintenance prediction, energy procurement optimization, or compliance reporting. But the current product scatter across HVAC, coastal engineering, and meteorology suggests the opposite of platform thinking. It suggests a team searching for a use case rather than building depth in one. The best distribution plays I've backed -- Stripe, Figma, Gusto -- all started with a ruthlessly narrow wedge and expanded from a position of strength. Inviscid AI appears to be spreading across multiple domains before achieving depth in any of them.

I'm passing. The market is real but already identified and funded. The team has raw AI talent but lacks the domain expertise this specific problem demands. The plan requires multiple sequential breakthroughs. And well-capitalized competitors with physics-based approaches, established customer bases, and in some cases incumbent hardware distribution are already 3-5 years ahead. This isn't a company positioned at a structural moment before anyone else sees it -- it's a late entrant to a recognized category with a team that would need to simultaneously solve the technical, domain, and distribution problems that competitors have already been working on with $100M+ in funding.
