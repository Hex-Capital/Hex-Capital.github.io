# DAIVIN! -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about DAIVIN! is the reframe: oxygen supply as an energy problem, not a gas logistics problem. That's genuine first-principles thinking. Compressed gas tanks have dominated diving for a century not because they're good technology but because nobody reframed the constraint. If you can electrolyze water into breathable oxygen using battery power, you've turned a logistics bottleneck into an engineering challenge that improves on Moore's Law curves. Every year batteries get denser, electrolyzers get cheaper, and the old technology — pressurized exotic gas mixes with helium up 400-1,000% since 2000 — gets more expensive. The directionality is right. This is the kind of physics-enabled disruption that pulled me into Extropic and ePlane — bets where the question isn't "is the market real?" but "can the physics actually deliver?"

The specific knowledge question, though, is where I get stuck. Leo Kankkunen has real credentials — youngest person in Finland to achieve the highest national electrical certification for high-voltage systems, seven years in the electrical industry, certified diver, military veteran. These are legitimate and relevant. But high-voltage power line engineering is not electrochemistry. Designing redundant circuits for electrolyzers requires expertise in membrane technology, gas management systems, underwater pressure dynamics, and dive physiology — disciplines that sit adjacent to but distinct from power systems engineering. The founder claims to have "invented and tested the first-ever tankless dive gear in history," which, if true, represents exactly the kind of hands-on, non-teachable knowledge I look for. But there's no independent validation — no third-party testing, no video of a working prototype at depth, no published data on oxygen generation rates versus human consumption requirements at pressure. For a life-critical system where failure means drowning, the gap between "I built and tested it" and "here's the independently verified data" matters more than in software.

The leverage architecture concerns me most. This is physical hardware — manufactured, shipped, maintained. Each unit requires proportional production effort. There are no network effects, no protocol dynamics, no code-as-leverage multiplier. The business scales linearly with manufacturing capacity and sales effort. Now, I've made hardware bets before — Extropic, Atomic Semi, Eight Sleep — but those either sit at a platform layer (chip design that enables entire ecosystems) or have recurring revenue mechanics (subscription mattress). DAIVIN! as described is a unit-economics hardware business selling to defense procurement cycles that run 2-5 years. A solo founder navigating MIL-SPEC certification, NATO procurement relationships, and multi-year sales cycles while simultaneously iterating on complex electrochemistry hardware is an execution challenge that borders on structural impossibility. I require a technologist on the founding team — Leo is technical, but he needs a co-founder with complementary expertise in electrochemistry or diving systems engineering.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. If portable electrolysis-based life support actually works at 200 meters, this isn't a dive equipment company — it's a portable oxygen platform. Defense, space, firefighting, submarine emergency systems, industrial confined spaces. The $5.2B SCBA market is the starting point, not the ceiling. Special operations forces that can operate at 200m without tank logistics and without nitrogen narcosis would fundamentally alter naval capabilities. The contrarian timing is genuine: battery energy density has roughly doubled since 2010, PEM electrolyzer costs have fallen with the hydrogen economy, and helium scarcity creates real economic pressure for alternatives. Smart people would dismiss this as "you can't safely electrolyze water into breathable gas in a portable device at crush depth" — and if they're wrong, the asymmetric upside is massive. This is the kind of bet where losses are capped at 1x and gains could be extraordinary. The triple-redundant electrolyzer with quadruple-redundant circuitry suggests someone thinking seriously about failure modes in life-critical systems, not hand-waving past safety.

But I keep coming back to the gap between the insight and the evidence. The 200-meter depth claim is extraordinary. At that depth, the ambient pressure is roughly 21 atmospheres. Electrolysis efficiency, gas purity requirements, and hydrogen management all become dramatically harder problems. No patents filed. No GitHub presence to inspect engineering quality. No independent validation. The founder's adjacent-but-not-direct technical background in power systems rather than electrochemistry. The solo-founder structure on a hardware company that requires expertise spanning at least four engineering disciplines simultaneously. I've seen founders with genuine first-principles insight fail because they underestimated the engineering gap between a beautiful reframe and a working product — and in this case, the product is life support equipment where "mostly works" is catastrophic. The insight is real. The founder is credentialed. But the specific knowledge isn't deep enough in the right domains, and the leverage mechanics of a hardware business don't create the nonlinear dynamics I invest for.
