# Tensol -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Tensol's entire technical foundation is an open-source framework that anyone can download. OpenClaw has 180,000 GitHub stars, which means 180,000 people -- including every competitor with tens of millions in funding -- have the same starting blocks. The creator of that framework just got acqui-hired by OpenAI, introducing governance uncertainty into the one piece of infrastructure this company depends on. When I look at this, I see a business that has outsourced its core runtime to a project it doesn't control, in a category where Lindy, 11x, Artisan, and Relevance AI have collectively raised over $185 million, and where Salesforce and Microsoft are building agent capabilities directly into platforms that already own the customer relationship. This is not a structural position. This is standing on someone else's surfboard in a crowded ocean.

Let me run my primary filter. "AI employees for your business" is not an insane idea -- it is the single most consensus idea in enterprise software right now. Every major platform demo at every conference in 2025 featured autonomous agents. Every VC deck circulating in San Francisco has an "agentic AI" thesis slide. The founders are competent -- Oliviero built integration infrastructure at Stacksync, Pratik has a CMU AI degree and Rivian engineering experience -- but competent founders chasing the hottest category in tech is exactly the combination that produces commoditized returns. The "sane person, insane idea" framework requires genuine non-consensus, the kind of idea that makes most investors uncomfortable or confused. Nobody is confused by "AI employees." Everybody wants to fund it. That's the problem.

Now apply the AI kill test, and this is where it gets brutal. My entire thesis centers on one question: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? If the answer is no, you don't have a business, you have a feature. Remove AI from Tensol and there is literally nothing left -- no service, no product, no operations, no physical infrastructure. Compare this to Craftwork, where the painting crews exist with or without software. Tensol is not "cherry on top." AI is the entire sundae. And when the underlying AI capabilities are commoditized -- which they are, because OpenClaw is open-source and every LLM provider is improving agent reliability quarterly -- the application layer gets squeezed. The OAuth connectors to Slack, GitHub, and Sentry? Those are table stakes. The "progressive autonomy" model? Every competitor will implement the same pattern. There is no structural moat here that survives the next twelve months of AI development.

The strongest bull case I can construct goes something like this: OpenClaw becomes the Linux of agent infrastructure, and Tensol becomes the Red Hat -- the enterprise deployment layer that makes the open-source runtime production-ready for large organizations. The cross-functional approach (agents spanning engineering, sales, support, marketing) could create organizational context that vertical competitors like 11x can't match, because a company's real workflows don't respect departmental boundaries. And the YC network gives them distribution into exactly the startup and mid-market segment that buys bottom-up before enterprise procurement kicks in. If they execute fast enough, accumulated company-specific context in their agents creates genuine switching costs. That's a real story -- but it requires believing that a two-person team can out-execute competitors with 30-50x their capital in a market where the underlying technology is free and the incumbents have existing distribution to hundreds of millions of users. I don't believe that. Red Hat worked because Linux was a genuinely new primitive that replaced proprietary operating systems over decades. OpenClaw is an agent framework that will be one of many, not a new protocol layer.

The product pivot from Solstis to Tensol also triggers a pattern I watch for. Solstis won a $50,000 venture competition at CMU in March 2025 as "an AI-powered platform using natural language to create workflow automations." Less than a year later, the company has rebranded around OpenClaw's explosive growth. Pivots can be smart -- responding to new information is a founder strength -- but pivoting toward the hottest open-source project in the world looks more like momentum-chasing than conviction-driven building. My best investments have been in founders who held structural positions for years before the market validated them. Helium was seven years from seed to unicorn. I bought Bitcoin in 2013. The founders who produce outlier returns are the ones building when nobody else cares, not the ones arriving after 180,000 GitHub stars make the opportunity obvious.

I'd rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company built on someone else's open-source layer, competing against $185 million in funded competitors, in the most consensus category in enterprise software. This is a clear pass.
