# Maven -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The Stripe comparison is the first thing anyone will think of when they see Maven, and it's worth unpacking why the analogy is both seductive and misleading. Stripe worked because every programmer already knew the problem -- payment processing was broken, the APIs were terrible, the documentation was hostile. The Collisons didn't discover that payments were hard; they discovered that they were willing to do the schlep of dealing with banks and compliance that thousands of other hackers had unconsciously filtered out. The problem was obvious and universal. Maven's situation is structurally different: they're building payment infrastructure not for the internet at large but for a specific middleware layer -- AI voice agent platforms -- that is itself only a year or two old. The schlep is real (PCI-DSS compliance is genuinely painful), but the problem they're solving exists only because VAPI, Retell, and LiveKit haven't built it yet. That's a crucial distinction. Stripe's schlep was permanent -- you always need to deal with banks. Maven's schlep might be temporary -- it disappears the moment one of these platforms ships a native payment feature.

The organic test is where this company loses me. How did these founders find this problem? Both are recent Berkeley CS/EECS grads with Amazon and Meta on their resumes. Neither has publicly documented experience in payments, fintech, or PCI compliance. The LinkedIn breadcrumb is telling -- Wasi Ahmed's headline at one point referenced "Building Invoke," a different project, before switching to "Co-Founder @ Maven (YC W26)." That trajectory suggests this idea was arrived at through iteration and market observation rather than personal frustration. I'm not seeing the Drew Houston moment -- the founder who kept forgetting his USB drive and couldn't stop thinking about the problem. This looks more like smart engineers who noticed a gap in a hot market and decided to fill it. That's not the worst origin story, but it's not the kind that produces companies that survive the years of painful execution ahead.

The disintermediation risk is what makes this a pass for me rather than a cautious yes. Maven is platform-agnostic middleware sitting between voice AI platforms and payment gateways. That sounds like a strong position until you realize the total feature surface is bounded: capture card data via voice/DTMF/SMS, route it through a PCI-compliant tunnel, hit a payment gateway API, return the result. This is not the kind of deep, expanding technical problem that compounds over time -- it's a well-defined integration challenge. VAPI or Retell, both well-funded and actively expanding their feature sets, could build this in a quarter if payment collection becomes a priority for their customers. Twilio already has `<Pay>` on its own platform. When your product can be replicated as a feature by your distribution partners, you don't have a company -- you have a proposal for a feature those partners haven't built yet.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. If voice AI agents genuinely become the primary transaction interface for home services, healthcare billing, insurance, and collections -- industries that collectively process hundreds of billions in payments annually -- then whoever owns the payment layer has an enormous business. PCI-DSS compliance is a real barrier, not a trivial one. The multi-platform, multi-gateway integration matrix creates switching costs once customers integrate. And there's a genuine timing window: legacy IVR payment companies (PCI Pal, Sycurio, Eckoh) are architecturally mismatched for AI voice platforms, and the voice AI platforms themselves are focused on their core product, not payment infrastructure. If Maven can sign up enough voice AI developers during this window and become the default payment rail, network effects and switching costs could make them hard to displace even when platforms consider building in-house. The best version of this story is one where Maven becomes so embedded that platforms partner with them rather than compete. It's a real scenario. I just don't have enough signal that these specific founders are the ones to execute it.

The founders are clearly technical and capable. Brandon Boehme co-built Berkeleytime, a production web application used by Berkeley students -- that's real full-stack product building, not a class project. Wasi Ahmed organized a hackathon that drew 2,900+ participants and $145K in prizes, which shows operational muscle. They've built a working product with four platform integrations and four gateway integrations, which is non-trivial execution. What's missing is evidence that they have the domain depth in payments and compliance to navigate the PCI-DSS certification process and the regulatory complexity that comes with handling live card data. Stripe had the advantage of founders who were hackers frustrated with payments as users. Maven's founders appear to be engineers who identified a market gap -- different motivation, different staying power when the compliance work gets genuinely ugly.

This is a pass for me. Not because the problem isn't real -- it is. And not because the founders aren't smart -- they clearly are. But the combination of no organic problem discovery, no payments domain expertise, severe platform disintermediation risk, zero traction evidence, and a feature-sized product surface makes this a bet where the downside scenarios are more numerous than the upside ones. The schlep of PCI compliance isn't the kind that builds a lasting moat -- it's the kind that gets absorbed by larger platforms once the market is big enough to justify the investment.
