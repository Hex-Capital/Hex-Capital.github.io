# Sparkles -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Sparkles is the platonic ideal of what I'd pass on in 2026. When someone pitches me "Lovable for existing projects" -- a SaaS tool built entirely on LLM APIs, GitHub's API, and commodity cloud sandboxes -- my immediate question isn't whether the product works. It probably works fine. My question is: what happens when Cursor, which has $3.4 billion in funding and a billion-dollar run rate, adds a "share with non-technical teammate" button? What happens when GitHub ships Copilot for non-engineers natively inside their PR workflow? What happens when Claude Code's existing GitHub Actions integration -- which already lets non-engineers trigger AI-generated PRs via issue comments -- gets a friendlier UI? The answer is that Sparkles stops being a company and starts being a feature that was briefly a company. The dossier itself acknowledges this: "The technical barrier to entry is low, making execution speed and product polish the primary differentiators." Execution speed is not a moat. It's a head start that gets erased.

Let me run my framework honestly. The sane-person-insane-idea test fails on both sides here. Dan Bekirov is 20, a UCL dropout with roughly a year of engineering experience at early-stage startups and a Cursor Ambassador title. That's a smart, energetic kid -- not a "sane person" in the Coinbase sense, where Brian Armstrong's Airbnb engineering background made a crypto exchange pitch credible from someone who clearly understood regulated financial infrastructure. Bekirov doesn't yet have the operational depth that makes a non-consensus bet feel anchored. And the idea itself isn't insane -- it's the most obvious adjacent move in the vibe coding space. Lovable went from $1M to $200M ARR in a year. Every AI coding company on the planet is thinking about how to serve existing codebases and non-technical users. This is a sane idea pursued by a founder who hasn't yet accumulated the credibility to make the "sane person" framework activate. That's the weakest quadrant.

The AI kill test is fatal here. My core question -- "would this business be good if AI didn't exist?" -- has a clear answer: no, it would not exist at all. The entire value proposition IS the AI. That's the opposite of what I look for. Craftwork would still be a painting company without AI; Metropolis would still operate parking infrastructure. Sparkles without AI is nothing -- no product, no business, no reason to exist. When the AI capability is this central and this obvious, you're not investing in a business with AI as a cherry on top. You're investing in a feature of future platforms. The subscription pricing model ($20/month, $80/month) on top of LLM API costs makes this even more structurally fragile -- this is SaaS pricing in a world where I've publicly said SaaS is over.

The strongest bull case goes like this: the "vibe coding" market is genuinely enormous and growing at 32% CAGR. There is a real, specific gap -- Lovable and Bolt generate new apps, but the hundreds of millions of existing codebases need a different tool. If Sparkles becomes the default way non-technical teams interact with production repos, enterprise switching costs could compound through configurations, rulesets, and workflow integrations. The PR-based review layer is clever because it preserves engineering authority, reducing the trust barrier that kills most "let non-engineers touch code" products. And the angel backing from individuals at xAI, a16z, OpenAI, Cloudflare, and General Catalyst suggests that sophisticated people saw something here. For this to work, you'd need to believe that the "safe editing of existing production codebases" problem is hard enough that a purpose-built tool maintains differentiation against incumbents adding it as a feature. I don't believe that. The components -- sandboxed environments, LLM code editing, GitHub PR creation -- are commoditized building blocks, and the well-funded incumbents have every incentive and every capability to assemble them.

There's no primitive being created here, no protocol that others would build on, no new layer of infrastructure that compounds. Sparkles is an application on top of GitHub, on top of LLM APIs, on top of someone else's cloud. It lives at the mercy of every platform it depends on. Compare this to Venmo, which created a new peer-to-peer payment primitive, or Aleo, which established zero-knowledge privacy as infrastructure. Sparkles creates no new primitive -- it wraps existing ones in a friendlier interface. That caps the upside story permanently. Even the narrative -- "make everyone an engineer" -- while elastic in theory, gets absorbed by every AI company's roadmap. That's not an infinity story; it's a marketing tagline that every competitor will use.
