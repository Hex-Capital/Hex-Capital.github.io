# Oximy -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Oximy is that this market is crowded before the company has even started. Harmonic Security has $26M, Noma Security has $132M, Grip Security has $66M, Prompt Security was acquired by SentinelOne -- and that's just the startup layer. CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, LayerX, and Island already have endpoint or browser agents deployed across the exact enterprise footprints Oximy is targeting. When I see a market where competitors have raised a combined $250M+ and an endpoint incumbent could ship a competing feature in a quarter, I'm not looking at a non-obvious market at a structural inflection. I'm looking at a consensus category where the structural moment is visible to everyone. The "shadow AI governance" problem is real -- Harmonic's data on 90% of employees using AI tools with only 40% having sanctioned access is a genuine pain point. But "real problem" and "non-obvious market" are different things. PagerDuty worked because operations alerting seemed boring and nobody was funding it. This is the opposite: every enterprise security investor already has a thesis on AI governance.

The structural moment question is where I'd normally get excited or walk away. What changed in the last 12-24 months? Enterprise AI adoption exploded, the EU AI Act created compliance requirements, shadow AI became a boardroom conversation. Those are real catalysts. But the catalysts are so visible that they've already attracted hundreds of millions in capital from competitors with multi-year head starts. When I invested in Coinbase, crypto infrastructure seemed strange and unfamiliar to most investors -- that unfamiliarity was the opportunity. AI governance in 2026 is not unfamiliar to anyone in enterprise security. The TAM projections ($2.5B growing to $68.2B) feel like exactly the kind of static market sizing I warn about -- projecting a growth rate without asking whether the market structure will consolidate around platform-native governance features from Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI as enterprises standardize on fewer AI platforms.

The commoditization risk is the structural problem I keep returning to. Oximy's core technology -- monitoring desktop and browser activity, classifying AI tool interactions against a 3,500-tool taxonomy -- is not technically defensible. It's endpoint monitoring with a lookup table. The taxonomy is useful but replicable with straightforward engineering investment. When I think about what makes a company "software-driven" rather than "software-aware," I ask whether the technology creates a compounding advantage that gets harder to replicate over time. A detection library that needs manual updating as new AI tools launch doesn't compound -- it's maintenance. The MDM deployment creates some switching cost, but that's friction, not a moat. Microsoft already has Defender deployed on those same endpoints and has every incentive to add AI usage monitoring as a feature of their Copilot governance dashboard.

The strongest bull case would require me to believe that the specific intersection Oximy occupies -- adoption analytics plus spend management plus governance, unified in one platform -- creates a category that no incumbent will prioritize. If SaaS management tools focus on general spend, AI security tools focus on threat prevention, and endpoint vendors focus on security posture, maybe there's a gap where "system of record for AI usage" lives. If Oximy could become the place where AI procurement decisions are made, where budgets are allocated, and where compliance is demonstrated to auditors -- not just where dashboards are viewed -- that would be a genuine platform position. The $49/month Oximy Lens product as a PLG wedge into enterprises is an interesting distribution tactic. And the regulatory tailwind from the EU AI Act is real: enterprises will need auditable AI governance tooling, and whoever becomes the reporting standard could lock in switching costs. For this to work, Naman would need to move faster than teams with 10-50x more resources, in a domain he pivoted into recently from healthtech. That's a bet on extraordinary execution velocity against structural disadvantage.

On the founder: Naman has clearly shipped product before -- Easocare reached some revenue, he was COO at an Altman-backed AI startup, and an early investor vouches for his velocity. But the prior venture's outcome ($223K revenue, $669K valuation) is modest, and the pivot from Indian healthtech SaaS to enterprise AI governance is a significant domain shift. Enterprise security sales to CISOs and CFOs at Fortune 500 companies is one of the hardest go-to-market motions in software, and doing it as a solo founder with a 5-person team against Noma's $132M war chest requires more than product velocity -- it requires enterprise distribution relationships that take years to build. The plan implicitly requires multiple things to work simultaneously: building defensible detection technology, achieving enterprise distribution, maintaining pace against well-funded competitors, and avoiding commoditization by platform vendors. That's not a single-miracle plan -- it's a multi-miracle plan where the miracles compound against each other.

I pass. The market is real but consensus, the technology isn't defensible enough to survive incumbent bundling, and the competitive landscape has already crystallized around better-funded players. When I look at the adoption curve, I don't see the gap between how the market looks today and where it's heading -- I see a market that looks exactly as hot as it is, with the capital flows to prove it.
