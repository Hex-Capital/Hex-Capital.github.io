# Aemon -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking fact about Aemon is not what the founders built -- it's that multiple independent teams built the same thing simultaneously. OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve, a student named "Alex" with something called "Tactical Maniac v0.5" -- all surpassing AlphaEvolve's circle packing results around the same time. When your breakthrough can be reproduced by a solo student with an open-source framework, you don't have difficult technology compounding over time. You have a well-documented technique anyone can execute. That's the central tension of this deal: the approach demonstrably works, but it's not proprietary. The evolutionary search paradigm using LLMs is published research. The leverage here belongs to the underlying language models, not to the orchestration layer Aemon is building on top of them.

The founders are genuinely precocious. Twin brothers, both publishing at ICLR and EMNLP before turning 20, international math and robotics medals, dropped out of strong CS programs. That's real intellectual horsepower. But the specific knowledge question cuts deeper than raw talent: what do Ray and Richard know about algorithmic optimization that can't be acquired by any sharp ML researcher spending six months with the AlphaEvolve paper? Their published research is in LLM applications, RAG, and information retrieval -- adjacent to the optimization domain but not born from years of obsessive work within it. Compare this to investing in someone who spent a decade building retrieval systems and discovered through that work a non-obvious insight about evolutionary search. These founders are brilliant generalists who identified a promising direction after AlphaEvolve validated it. That's intelligence and energy. It's not the same as non-transferable domain knowledge that took years to accumulate.

The leverage architecture looks compelling on the surface -- one optimization run replacing months of human R&D experimentation is genuine multiplicative output. But examine where the leverage actually lives. Aemon consumes LLMs from model providers, orchestrates evolutionary iterations, and evaluates results against user-defined metrics. The leverage is rented from the model layer, not owned at the product layer. And the "Book a Discovery Call" GTM signals a high-touch sales motion where each new customer domain likely requires custom configuration and hand-holding. That's labor-proportional scaling dressed up as a platform. When I backed Stack Overflow, the compounding was in the knowledge graph -- every question and answer made the system more valuable and harder to replicate. Aemon's accumulated optimization patterns could theoretically compound similarly across domains, but there's no evidence of that flywheel yet, and the open-source implementations provide the same starting capability for free.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the gap between "running evolutionary search on benchmarks" and "making it work reliably in production across diverse engineering domains" is enormous -- a product-engineering moat rather than a research moat. If that's true, and if these founders have the taste and tenacity to build the productized, enterprise-grade platform that Google won't bother commercializing externally, the market could be very large. The legal retrieval case study showing recall improvement from 0.540 to 0.912 is more interesting to me than the circle packing record, because it demonstrates applicability to a real engineering workflow rather than a competitive leaderboard. If Aemon can accumulate dozens of such domain-specific wins, each one teaching the system something about how to navigate new solution spaces, there's a compounding story worth watching. The founders' youth is also genuinely an asset -- if they have the persistence, they could compound for decades. At 20, dropping out to pursue this, the long-term orientation is structurally present even if unproven.

But I keep returning to the timing problem. This is not a contrarian bet. AlphaEvolve validated the approach five months ago. Sakana AI has raised $479 million. Periodic Labs raised $300 million at seed. Open-source implementations proliferate. Smart people don't dismiss AI-driven R&D -- they're actively funding it at massive scale. When the consensus already agrees you're in the right category, your upside is capped by execution speed against well-resourced competitors. You get paid for being right first, and Aemon isn't first -- it's entering a race that Google, a $2.65B-valued Sakana, and the open-source community are all running. The circle packing result is a nice credential, but it's a credential that expires -- next month someone else will beat it with another open-source framework. Without structural defensibility, you're betting on execution in a sprint, not on compounding in a marathon.

I like these founders. They're young, technically strong, and clearly energetic. If I met them I'd probably enjoy the conversation and learn something about evolutionary search heuristics. But the deal fails my leverage test at the structural level -- the company is an application layer consuming infrastructure it doesn't control, competing with open-source alternatives in a consensus category, with no visible moat beyond execution speed. The specific knowledge is emerging but not yet distinct. I'd want to see them develop a proprietary insight about how evolutionary optimization works differently across domains -- something that can't be extracted from their published papers or replicated by reading the AlphaEvolve codebase. Right now, this is a talent bet in a crowded race, and my framework demands more than talent.
