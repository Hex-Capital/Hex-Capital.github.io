# Sparkles -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me immediately: this is a company building in the single most consensus category in all of technology right now. AI coding tools. Cursor just raised $3.4 billion. Lovable went from a million to two hundred million in ARR in under a year. Bolt, Replit -- everyone with capital is piling in. And Sparkles is positioning itself as "Lovable for existing projects," which is literally defining itself relative to the hottest startup in the space. I've said it many times -- the most promising companies are not popular and they are difficult to assess. This company is in the most popular category imaginable, and the value proposition is immediately easy to assess. That's the opposite of the signal I trust. When every VC in town understands the market thesis on first hearing, the weirdness has been competed away and the price of being right is already too high.

I want to know Dan Bekirov's story. He's twenty years old, Ukrainian, dropped out of UCL, worked at a couple of YC startups, was a Cursor Ambassador. That's a technically capable young person with real hustle. But the dossier gives me nothing about why THIS problem. What's the biographical thread? When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception that everyone else ignored -- his life and the company's mission were the same thing. With Uber, I'd spent years having conversations with my husband about the taxi medallion system before I ever met Travis. I need to feel that the founder and the problem are inseparable, and here I see a talented engineer who noticed a gap in the market. That's a perfectly valid reason to start a company, but it's not what makes me write a check from my own money.

The bull case deserves a real hearing. The gap Dan identified is genuinely real -- companies with existing production codebases can't just start over in Lovable, and their marketing teams really are stuck filing tickets for button color changes. If Sparkles nails the sandboxed editing experience and builds deep GitHub workflow integrations before the incumbents turn their attention here, there could be real switching costs at the enterprise level. The angel investors from xAI, a16z, OpenAI, and Cloudflare suggest people inside the AI ecosystem see something. And at twenty, Dan has decades of compounding ahead of him -- some extraordinary founders started this young. The timing argument is legitimate: the vibe coding explosion created millions of new codebases that will need ongoing maintenance by the non-technical people who built them. If I squint, this is infrastructure at an inflection point, which is a pattern I've invested into before.

But I can't get past the defensibility problem, and defensibility is one of the first things I look for at the earliest stages. The dossier says it plainly: "The technical barrier to entry is low." Sandboxed environments, LLM APIs, GitHub's API -- these are commodity components. Claude Code already lets non-engineers trigger PRs through GitHub Actions. Builder.io already does visual editing with PR output. Any of the massively funded competitors could ship this feature in a quarter. When I backed Flock Safety or Affirm, there were regulatory moats, data network effects, things that got harder to replicate over time. Here, the moat thesis is "enterprise configuration stickiness," which is the weakest form of defensibility I know. And a solo twenty-year-old founder trying to run an enterprise sales motion against companies with billions in the bank -- that's not a complexity moat, that's a resource mismatch.

This also doesn't activate my economic access lens at all. Uber created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. Postmates put money in delivery workers' pockets. Affirm gave transparent credit to people the system excluded. Sparkles helps marketing teams at tech companies skip the engineering ticket queue. That's a real productivity gain, but it's not creating opportunity for people who lack it. It's not making an invisible system visible or transparent. It's a workflow optimization for knowledge workers who already have plenty of access.

I respect Dan's ambition and I'd be curious to hear his full story over coffee -- there might be something about his journey from Ukraine, about what drives him, that the public record doesn't capture. But based on what I can see, this is a technically competent founder in the hottest consensus market, without defensibility signals, without biographical grit connecting him to the problem, and without the kind of weirdness that makes me lean forward. This is a pass for me.
