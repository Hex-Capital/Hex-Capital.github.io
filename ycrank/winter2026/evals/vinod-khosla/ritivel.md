# Ritivel -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Ritivel is the competitive landscape they're walking into, and what it tells me about the magnitude of the opportunity. When I backed Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry thought plant-based heme was absurd. The signal I look for is experts dismissing the approach. Here, the opposite is happening: McKinsey has already co-developed an AI CSR platform with Merck and published the results. Certara, a public company, launched CoAuthor in October 2023. Yseop has powered 150+ clinical trials and won a TIME Best Inventions award. Deep Intelligent Pharma has raised $110M+. When incumbents and consultants are already validating your approach, you're not attacking a problem others consider impossible -- you're arriving at a party that started two years ago. That's a disqualifying signal in my framework.

Let me start where I always start: the consequence of success. If Ritivel completely succeeds -- captures dominant market share in AI-powered regulatory writing -- what changes? Pharma companies write Clinical Study Reports and CTDs faster. First drafts that took 180 hours take 80. That's genuinely useful. The $45M-per-month cost of drug delay is a real number. But I need to be honest about what this is: workflow acceleration for a specific professional function. The $869 million TAM they're operating in tells the story. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. Pharma still runs the same clinical trials, still navigates the same FDA processes, still employs regulatory affairs teams. Ritivel, at maximum ambition, makes the paperwork phase of drug approval more efficient. I've passed on hundreds of companies that make enterprise workflows 30% faster, because the consequence of that success -- even when it works perfectly -- is a modest business in a market that was already being served.

The strongest bull case would require me to believe that regulatory writing automation is a wedge into transforming the entire $9.47 billion regulatory affairs market -- that once you own the document generation layer, you expand into submission management, regulatory intelligence, and eventually reshape how drugs move through approval. If the founders demonstrated that kind of expansive vision, and if the technology created a structural advantage that couldn't be replicated, I'd lean in despite the modest starting point. Square started as a dongle but the consequence of success was rewriting the entire payment infrastructure for small businesses. But I don't see that trajectory here. The differentiators -- local deployment, word-level citations, Veeva and SharePoint integrations -- are features, not architectures. Any well-funded competitor can build local deployment. The core technology, LLM-based document generation, is available to any team with access to foundation models. The dossier itself identifies this commoditization risk explicitly.

On the founders: Pavan Kalyan Tankala has genuine research chops -- NeurIPS '23 publication on text-to-SQL is directly relevant to generating structured documents from clinical data, and SIGMOD workshop papers show real database systems thinking. That's not credential padding. But the team composition reveals a gap that concerns me: three technically capable people from strong Indian engineering institutions, and not a single person who has ever written a regulatory submission, navigated an FDA review, or worked inside a pharma regulatory affairs department. Gunin Gupta's Kearney consulting background gives enterprise sales orientation, which matters. But when you're building a product that must be accurate enough that pharmaceutical companies will trust it for FDA submissions, you need someone who has lived inside that process. The partially unverified Microsoft Research claim adds uncertainty -- the YC description says they "previously built AI copilots at Microsoft Research," but public sources only confirm a Microsoft internship for the CEO and an unspecified Microsoft Research connection for one other founder. I evaluate teams by learning rate, not credentials, and I can't assess learning rate from a dossier. But the absence of domain-specific team construction for a domain-critical product is a structural weakness.

The timing tells the final part of the story. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was laughable. When I entered cleantech in 2004, most VCs hadn't heard of the category. I look for the moment before the exponential curve becomes consensus. Ritivel is entering regulatory writing AI in early 2026, after McKinsey published results, after Certara shipped a product, after Yseop accumulated 150+ clinical trials of proof points. The underlying technology breakthrough -- LLMs reaching quality thresholds for structured domain-specific generation -- happened in 2023. The institutional readiness -- 80% of top pharma companies modernizing their regulatory information systems -- is already documented. This is a real wave, but Ritivel isn't ahead of it. They're riding it alongside better-capitalized, more established competitors who already have pharma customer relationships. Being early to a trend is a massive advantage; being concurrent with well-funded incumbents at pre-seed is not.

These are smart, technically capable founders building a real product for a real market. I don't doubt they could build a functional business. But I invest in things where the consequence of success justifies the effort -- where if everything goes right, an industry operates differently. Ritivel has scoped itself into a tractable problem and reduced its risk of failure, which is exactly what I warn founders against. The ambition is calibrated to a niche, not to a transformation.
