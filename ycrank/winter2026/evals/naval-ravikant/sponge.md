# Sponge -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Sponge is not the founders or the product -- it's the competitive landscape. Visa Intelligent Commerce, Mastercard Agent Pay, Stripe Agentic Commerce Suite, Coinbase AgentKit with 50 million x402 transactions, Catena Labs at $18M from a16z, Payman AI at $13.8M with Visa as an investor, Skyfire at $9.5M, Natural at $9.8M. When I count that many well-capitalized players converging on the same thesis simultaneously, I'm not looking at a contrarian bet. I'm looking at consensus. "Anyone in this business who's chasing hot markets gets killed." Agent payments in February 2026 is the definition of a hot market. The asymmetric upside has already been priced away -- not by the valuation of Sponge itself, but by the probability that Sponge specifically wins in a field this crowded.

Now, the specific knowledge question. Three co-founders who built Stripe's stablecoin financial accounts and core money movement systems. That's real. You don't learn how fiat and crypto rails interact in a classroom. You learn it by shipping production payment infrastructure that handles real money at Stripe scale. That knowledge is operational and hard-earned -- but it's not unique in the way I need it to be. Stripe has thousands of engineers, and the payments infrastructure alumni network is deep. The specific knowledge here is about the *plumbing* -- how to build payment systems -- not about the *novel domain* -- how AI agents will transact, what spending patterns look like, what failure modes emerge when non-human actors hold and deploy capital. I don't see evidence that these founders have spent years developing a theory of agent economics that would surprise me. They've taken their Stripe playbook and pointed it at a new buyer: the agent instead of the human. That's a reasonable extrapolation, not a non-obvious insight.

The leverage architecture is where Sponge gets interesting. This is infrastructure, not application -- and my portfolio says I systematically favor infrastructure. Sponge Wallet plus Sponge Gateway creates a two-sided structure: agents on one side with wallets and spending controls, businesses on the other side uploading API specs to accept agent payments with no code changes. If both sides reach critical mass, you get genuine network effects -- every new business on the Gateway makes every Wallet more useful, and vice versa. The fiat-plus-crypto hybrid is a meaningful architectural choice that most competitors haven't made; Coinbase and Skyfire are crypto-only, which means they can't handle the 95% of commerce that still runs on traditional rails. The TypeScript SDK and MCP integration with agent frameworks is the right distribution wedge for a developer-first infrastructure play. This is the Alchemy playbook applied to agent payments rather than blockchain APIs. The leverage ratio is theoretically strong -- one engineering team builds the infrastructure, millions of agent transactions flow through it.

The bull case deserves a full articulation. If the agent economy follows the trajectory of mobile commerce -- where the infrastructure providers who were in position when volume exploded captured durable value -- then being early with the right abstraction layer matters more than being well-funded. Sponge's Gateway product, where a business just uploads an API spec and agents can autonomously onboard and pay, is genuinely differentiated and could become the standard integration pattern. Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite targets URBN and Etsy -- large merchants with consumer checkout flows. Sponge targets the long tail of developers and services that agents consume: APIs, data feeds, compute resources. These are different markets with different distribution dynamics. If Sponge nails the developer layer, they could become the payments primitive that agent frameworks default to, similar to how Stripe became the default for web developers. The team has the technical credibility to ship fast and iterate. In this scenario, the $500K YC check becomes extremely valuable.

But I keep returning to the structural problem. When your former employer -- the company whose infrastructure you literally built -- enters your space with their brand, their merchant relationships, and their engineering resources, the burden of proof is on the startup to explain why the layer distinction holds. Stripe has expanded downmarket before; it's what they do. The regulatory dimension also concerns me: giving AI agents autonomous spending authority raises KYC/AML questions that Catena Labs is explicitly addressing with a regulated financial institution model, while Sponge's regulatory posture is undisclosed. In payments, regulatory naivety compounds. The technology itself -- SDKs, wallet management, spending controls, API gateway -- does not obviously compound over time. A well-resourced team could replicate the core product in months. Without proprietary transaction data at scale (which doesn't exist because agent transaction volume is approximately zero), there's no data moat forming.

The founders pass the integrity filter by default -- no red flags, shared professional history at Stripe suggesting mutual trust, and YC backing. But I don't see evidence of the kind of long-term, decade-scale thinking that distinguishes compounding founders from competent operators. The long game here would require surviving a competitive war against companies with 30-40x more capital while a market that doesn't yet exist matures to meaningful scale. That's a hard hand to play, and it requires either exceptional distribution or exceptional patience from investors. This is a competent team building reasonable infrastructure in a consensus category. That's not what I write checks for.
