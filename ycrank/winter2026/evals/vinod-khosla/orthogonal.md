# Orthogonal -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about Orthogonal is the competitive landscape surrounding it -- and what that landscape reveals about the founders' ambition calibration. Coinbase and Cloudflare are building x402. Stripe and OpenAI launched ACP. Google has AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. These are trillion-dollar companies building the payment infrastructure for agents. And Orthogonal looked at all of this and said: we'll build the aggregation layer on top. That's a revealing strategic choice. It's the choice of people who looked at a massive, chaotic, emerging market and found the safest layer to occupy -- above the protocol wars, below the agent frameworks, in the comfortable middle of stitching existing APIs together with a unified key and pay-per-call billing. I've seen this pattern many times, and it's the pattern of founders who have reduced the probability of failure to the point where the consequences of success are, frankly, modest.

If Orthogonal succeeds completely -- captures the dominant aggregation layer for agent-consumed APIs -- what changes? Developers save time managing API keys. Billing gets consolidated. Agents discover tools more easily. That's useful. It might even be a good business. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No industry becomes obsolete. No physical reality changes. Compare this to Square, which didn't just aggregate payment processors -- it enabled millions of merchants who literally could not accept cards before to participate in digital commerce. Square changed who could transact. Orthogonal changes how many browser tabs a developer needs open. The agentic commerce TAM numbers are real -- McKinsey's $3-5T by 2030 is directionally plausible -- but Orthogonal is positioning itself as an intermediary within that market, not as the force that creates or transforms it. The consequence of success is a well-run marketplace business, not an industry disruption.

The founders' backgrounds are the tell. Christian Pickett did payments at Coinbase and billing infrastructure at Vercel. Bera Sogut built APIs at Google -- reCAPTCHA, Maps -- and engineered at Amazon Robotics. They are building precisely what their resumes qualify them to build. This is the exact anti-pattern I warn about. These are clearly talented engineers -- Sogut's two ICPC World Finals appearances, ranking 24th globally, demonstrate exceptional raw problem-solving ability. But talent deployed within the comfort zone of prior experience produces incremental innovation, not invention. The greatest technology companies weren't built by people who knew what was possible in their field. They were built by people who didn't know what was impossible. Pickett and Sogut know exactly what's possible in API payments and infrastructure, and they've built exactly that -- no more, no less.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. The timing dimension is genuinely strong. MCP dropped in late 2024, agent frameworks hit production in 2024-2025, and the payment protocol launches in 2025 created a specific convergence window. If agent-to-API transaction volume follows the exponential curve that AI adoption suggests, then the aggregation layer could become enormously valuable through marketplace network effects -- the "App Store" for the agent economy. First-mover advantage in two-sided marketplaces can be durable once supply-side density crosses a threshold. And the founders' specific experience -- payments plus API infrastructure -- is unusually well-matched to execute this exact product. If I'm wrong about consequence magnitude, it's because the agentic economy creates a transaction layer so vast that the aggregator captures transformational value not through disruption but through sheer volume. But I've heard this argument before about infrastructure middleware plays, and the pattern is that the protocol layer below or the application layer above captures the real value, while the aggregation layer gets squeezed or absorbed. With Stripe, Coinbase, and Google all active in this space, the question isn't whether Orthogonal can build the product -- it's whether any of these companies adds a discovery tab to their existing platform and eliminates the need for a standalone aggregator overnight.

The technology itself is integration work, not invention. Unified authentication, pay-per-call billing, API packaging as "Skills" -- these are product design choices, not technology breakthroughs. There is no novel technology described in the dossier that would make the incumbent approach economically unviable. Existing API gateways -- Kong, Apigee, MuleSoft -- would need to retool for agent-native consumption, and that retooling friction provides a window. But the technical complexity of building what Orthogonal has built is moderate. Any well-funded competitor with marketplace-building experience could replicate the core functionality. The dossier itself acknowledges this: "The defensibility depends on achieving supply-side density before competitors do." When your defensibility statement is "we need to move faster than better-capitalized competitors," you're in a foot race you're structurally likely to lose.

I keep coming back to the fundamental question: are these founders attacking a problem whose consequence of success justifies the attempt? Or have they found a clever niche where the risk is manageable and the outcome is a comfortable business? Everything in the dossier points to the latter. Fourteen API providers at launch. Pay-per-call pricing with no minimums. Free credits for sign-ups. MCP compatibility with existing frameworks. These are the moves of a well-executed marketplace launch -- and I don't doubt the execution capability. But I invest in companies that attempt things the consensus considers impossible or crazy. Nobody looks at an API aggregation marketplace and says "that's crazy." They say "that's sensible." And sensible is precisely what I avoid.
