# Ressl AI -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The pivot is the first thing I notice, and it tells a complicated story. Ressl AI built a Salesforce AI administration tool, got it to $440K in revenue, and then walked away from it to build AI agents for collision shops and HVAC companies. That's either courageous discipline or a warning sign. The question is which. When they describe how they found the trades opportunity, the answer is revealing: they started as "an AI consulting firm talking to businesses across every industry" and noticed trades had the most glue work. That's market scanning. It's not Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive. It's not the Collison brothers being furious about Stripe's predecessors because they'd personally suffered through payment integration. It's smart people methodically surveying industries until they found one that looked promising. I've written about this failure mode — ideas that are "thought up" rather than stumbled into. The trades problem is real. The discovery method is synthetic.

The schlep, though, deserves credit. When the founders describe walking into collision shops and finding 2-4 people whose entire job is copying data between CCCOne, QuickBooks, and vendor systems, they're describing genuine ugly complexity that most AI startups would unconsciously avoid. Insurance coordination, parts procurement, legacy software integration across fragmented sub-verticals — each of these is the kind of tedious regulatory and logistical tangle that makes smart founders look the other way. The problem has been sitting in plain sight for years, which is the signature of schlep blindness in the market. But here's the distinction: the market participants are blind to this problem as a startup opportunity, while the founders discovered it through deliberate survey rather than personal pain. That's a weaker signal than organic discovery. A founder who ran a collision shop for five years and finally snapped would have intuitions about this business that no amount of consulting visits can replicate.

The co-founder situation concerns me. Arushi Gandhi joined Entrepreneurs First "earlier this year" before founding Ressl AI in 2024, and both founders come from different Indian engineering institutions with no confirmed shared employer or prior relationship. EF is literally a program designed to match strangers to build companies together. I've seen this pattern before — in one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they didn't know well, and all nine fell apart within a year. The co-founder relationship is for a startup what location is for real estate. I can't confirm they met through EF, but the timeline is suggestive, and there's no evidence of a deep pre-existing relationship.

The competitive landscape makes the timing brutal. Netic has raised $43M from Founders Fund and Greylock, is valued at $450M, and has grown revenue 1,700% in under a year — in the same essential services vertical. ServiceTitan, now public, is already shipping AI voice agents and booking agents directly into its widely-deployed platform. Ressl AI enters this market with $500-750K in funding, zero visible traction in their new vertical, and a 4-person team. When a startup requires competing against a $43M-funded company with massive momentum in the exact same space, the founders need either a dramatically different approach or dramatically superior execution. I don't see evidence of either yet.

The strongest bull case would go like this: the consulting-to-product pipeline actually works when the consultants are technical enough to build what they observe, the PE roll-up distribution channel is genuinely clever (one relationship unlocks dozens of locations), and ServiceTitan's business model conflict — they can't ship agents that make their own per-seat pricing obsolete — gives a startup real room to run. The $440K Salesforce revenue proves the team can build AI agents that interact with enterprise software and sell them to real customers. If they can transfer that execution to trades, the market is enormous and fragmented enough to support a new entrant even alongside Netic. Arushi Gandhi's hackathon track record and full-stack development background suggest genuine building ability. But this bull case requires the transferred execution to happen fast, in a vertical the founders have no personal history with, against competitors who are already there. That's a lot of "ifs."

On the technical founder dimension, Arushi Gandhi does appear to be a genuine builder — 42 GitHub repos, full-stack development internships, hackathon wins, Microsoft internship. She built the prior Salesforce product. That's real. Abhishek Eswaran is described as a "software geek" from IIT Bombay, but there's no public GitHub and limited technical evidence. The team built a working product before; they can build again. This is the one dimension where I see above-average signal for a pre-seed company.

I'm passing. The problem is real and the schlep is genuine, but the founders found it through market scanning rather than lived experience, may have met through a co-founder matching program, have zero traction in their current vertical after pivoting away from a revenue-generating product, and face a competitor with 57x their funding and explosive growth in the same space. Smart founders, real market, manufactured discovery.
