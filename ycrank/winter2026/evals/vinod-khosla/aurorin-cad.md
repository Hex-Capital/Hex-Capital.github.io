# Aurorin CAD -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about Aurorin is that a single person — still a student, with intern credits — has apparently built a parametric B-Rep CAD kernel from scratch. To understand why that matters: the two dominant kernels in the industry, Parasolid and ACIS, were developed by teams of dozens over decades. They form the foundation under SolidWorks, NX, Creo, CATIA — the entire professional CAD stack. Almost nobody attempts a ground-up kernel because the conventional wisdom says it's a multi-year, multi-team impossibility. Michael Baron either doesn't know that, or knows it and doesn't care. That's exactly the kind of signal I pay attention to. When I first started meeting with Pradeep Sindhu about what became Juniper Networks, Cisco's CTO told me they'd never build a TCP/IP router. The thing about people who build from the ground up what everyone else says can't be built is that they create structural advantages incumbents can't replicate without destroying their own architecture. Baron's four-year personal project building a multi-GPU graphics engine, his SpaceX propulsion simulation work, his Apple GPU driver internship — this is someone who operates at the systems level. The technical audacity here is real.

But I have to ask my first question before anything else: if Aurorin fully succeeds, what changes? The answer is that mechanical CAD gets faster and more AI-native. Hardware companies ship products quicker. That's valuable — it's a $12 billion market — but it's an efficiency gain for an existing process, not a transformation of how the physical world operates. "Help hardware companies ship faster" is the tagline, and it's revealing. Compare this to Impossible Foods, where success meant reclaiming half the world's arable land, or Commonwealth Fusion, where success means replacing fossil fuel power generation. When I hear "ship faster," I hear an optimization pitch, not a transformation pitch. A 100x speedup in part design is impressive, but SolidWorks already works. Nobody's dying because CAD files take four hours to open. The consequence of success here is a very good software business — maybe a $5-10 billion company — but not a world that operates fundamentally differently. The founder may be thinking bigger than the tagline suggests, but from what I can see, the ambition is calibrated to tool improvement, not industry obsolescence.

Now, the bull case deserves genuine engagement, because there's a version of this that is a Juniper-scale bet. Juniper attacked Cisco's legacy architecture with a ground-up TCP/IP router. Aurorin is attacking legacy CAD kernels with a ground-up AI-native kernel. The structural dynamics are similar: incumbents can't rebuild their kernels without breaking backward compatibility for millions of existing design files, certified manufacturing workflows, and decades of plugin ecosystems. Dassault derives massive revenue from maintenance contracts tied to the current architecture. If AI-native design becomes the paradigm — where engineers specify intent and constraints while AI generates the geometry — then 1980s kernels become as obsolete as pre-TCP/IP routers. The second-order effect is that hardware design becomes accessible to a much larger population, potentially accelerating physical-world innovation across every industry. If I squint at this through a sufficiently long time horizon, the consequence magnitude grows considerably. The question is whether Baron is building toward that paradigm shift or toward a better SolidWorks.

The technology disruption dimension is where this company genuinely excites me. Every other AI-CAD startup in this wave — Zoo, Adam, Hestus — is either wrapping existing geometry engines, plugging into incumbent tools, or doing text-to-3D generation that doesn't solve professional parametric design. Baron built the kernel itself. That means his AI can manipulate geometry at the engine level rather than sending commands through a legacy API. This is an architectural advantage that's analogous to what made Juniper's routers fundamentally better, not just incrementally better. The incumbents' AI additions — PTC's Onshape AI Advisor, for instance — are by definition constrained by the kernel underneath. You can bolt a chatbot onto a 1980s engine, but you can't make the engine think. Baron's approach is the only one I see in this category that could create genuine structural obsolescence rather than feature competition.

My concern is that the gene pool isn't engineered for the magnitude of what's being attempted. This is a solo founder building a CAD kernel, an AI agent, a desktop application for two platforms, and presumably the file format compatibility layer that professional adoption requires — simultaneously. Baron has clearly demonstrated he can build complex systems alone (the four-year graphics engine), but CAD is not just geometry. It's tolerancing, GD&T, assemblies with thousands of parts, simulation integration, CAM output, PLM workflows, and industry certifications. Each of those is its own deep domain. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep was one person initially, but the first thing we did was engineer the gene pool — recruit people who addressed the top risks. Baron's YC page says "not currently hiring." For a kernel that historically required dozens of specialized engineers, that's not a feature, it's a gap. The technology vision is strong enough that I'd want to see the first three hires address specific risks: someone who's lived inside professional CAD workflows, someone who understands manufacturing certification requirements, and a go-to-market person who's sold into engineering organizations.

The timing trajectory is favorable but not uniquely early. The AI capability threshold for automating multi-step design workflows crossed in 2023-2025. GPU compute now enables what legacy CPU kernels couldn't. Multiple funded startups and incumbent AI additions confirm category formation. This isn't pre-consensus — it's early consensus. Baron isn't four years ahead of the market the way I was with OpenAI in 2019 or cleantech in 2004. He's riding a wave that others see, though his architectural approach is differentiated within that wave.

I'd take a meeting with Baron. The technical audacity and structural disruption logic are compelling enough to warrant a conversation where I can assess his rate of learning and whether his ambition extends beyond "faster CAD" to something that genuinely makes the current approach to hardware design obsolete. But on the evidence in front of me, the consequence magnitude isn't at the level where I write checks without hesitation, and the solo-founder execution risk for a kernel-complexity project is material. This is a bet on a technically brilliant young outsider building infrastructure — which is my pattern — but the problem he's solving needs to be framed as more important than "hardware companies ship faster" before I'm fully engaged.
