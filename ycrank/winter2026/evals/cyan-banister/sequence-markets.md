# Sequence Markets -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Sequence Markets: this is a company competing in one of the most consensus-validated categories in all of fintech. Talos is valued at $1.5 billion. FalconX at $8 billion. CoinRoutes has a patent on smart order routing in crypto markets. Wyden and sFOX are well-capitalized. Every institutional player in digital assets knows that execution infrastructure matters -- this is not a secret, it's not unpopular, and it is not difficult to assess. The whole reason I get excited about a company is when other investors look at it and think it's insane. When I wrote my first check into SpaceX, people thought I was out of my mind. When I backed Crusoe, nobody could understand why you'd mine Bitcoin on gas flares. Sequence Markets is building something that dozens of well-funded teams are already building, and the market has already priced in the opportunity. That's the opposite of where I find my best investments.

If I could sit down with Muhammad and Peter, my first question wouldn't be about their routing algorithms or their latency numbers. It would be: tell me your story. How did you end up here? And based on everything in this dossier, I'm not hearing the biographical fire I look for. Peter Bai has genuinely relevant experience -- TMX Group, a $12.8 billion pension fund, quantitative finance and market microstructure. That's real domain grounding, and I respect it. Muhammad Awan has strong technical credentials through Waterloo and an incoming Databricks role. But relevant domain experience is not the same thing as biographical compulsion. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research that no one else cared about -- his identity was fused to the problem. Here, I see two smart early-career people who identified a market opportunity. That's a fine reason to start a company, but it doesn't give me the signal I need to write a check from my own money. I invest in people whose personal history makes them uniquely suited -- almost destined -- to solve their specific problem.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If tokenization of real-world assets actually reaches BCG's $16 trillion projection, and if MiCA-style best-execution mandates spread globally, there will be an enormous structural need for venue-neutral, non-custodial execution technology. The architectural choice to stay lightweight and broker-agnostic is genuinely smart positioning -- the incumbents are bundling custody, credit, and execution into vertically integrated prime brokerages, which creates a real opening for a focused execution layer. Think about how the full-service brokerages face cannibalization risk if they unbundle. If Peter's TMX experience gives him insight into how traditional market structure principles apply to digital assets in ways the crypto-native incumbents miss, that could be a meaningful edge. And the regulatory tailwind is real -- when compliance mandates best execution reporting, someone has to provide it. For these things to make Sequence Markets a great investment, you'd need to believe that (a) the founders can build institutional-grade infrastructure with a team of five against competitors with hundreds of engineers, (b) the AI differentiation is real and not just a label, and (c) the CoinRoutes patent doesn't block their core technology. That's a lot of simultaneous assumptions.

What I uniquely notice is what this company doesn't do: it doesn't create economic access for people who currently lack it. Uber created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people the system excluded. Postmates put money in delivery workers' pockets. Sequence Markets optimizes trade execution for hedge funds and institutional investors -- people who already have access to capital, technology, and sophisticated infrastructure. I don't see how this makes an invisible system visible to ordinary people or alleviates any form of economic exclusion. It's financial plumbing optimization for the already-wealthy. That's a legitimate business, but it doesn't activate the part of my framework where I get genuinely excited about a company's potential impact on the world.

On the co-founder front, I have almost nothing to work with. No shared university, no shared employer, no public record of how Muhammad and Peter found each other or how long they've worked together. After HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect products die from founder conflict, I need to understand how co-founders fight and resolve disagreements before I invest. With five people on the team and institutional clients expecting sub-millisecond reliability, the pressure will be immense. I can't evaluate what I can't see. This isn't a red flag in the HQ Trivia sense -- I'm not seeing active dysfunction -- but the absence of evidence about their working relationship leaves a gap in my assessment that I can't bridge from the outside.
