# CatchBack Cards -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with CatchBack: I can't find the story. When I look at Joseph Zhang, I see an impressive resume -- Stanford, Gates Scholar, ISEF finalist, McKinsey, AWS -- but I don't see the biographical thread that connects *this person* to *this problem* in a way that would sustain him through the years of brutal grind ahead. His YC page says he "quit his job to sell Pokemon cards," and I want to feel something when I read that, but what I feel is someone who caught a hobby wave, not someone who's been forged by a specific hardship that makes this company inevitable. The QuestBridge full-ride scholarship hints at a story I might want to hear -- that program serves exceptional students from low-income backgrounds -- and if there's a deeper narrative there about economic exclusion or about growing up unable to afford the packs his friends were opening, that would change my calculation. But from what's publicly visible, I'm looking at a talented engineer who likes Pokemon cards, and at this stage I invest in people, not products.

The co-founder situation amplifies my concern. Sophia Kim is a ghost in the public record -- no education, no work history, no social presence, nothing. Joseph appears in every piece of public-facing material. After HQ Trivia taught me that even the best-timed product in the world can be destroyed by unresolved co-founder dynamics, I need to understand how the team functions under pressure. I need to know how they argue, who makes final calls, and whether their partnership has been tested. Here I have literally nothing to evaluate. That's not a red flag per se -- it could just be that Sophia is a private person who's heads-down building -- but it means one of my core filters is completely blind.

Let me be honest about what's working here, because the traction deserves respect. $13,000 in monthly recurring revenue with 700 users roughly four weeks after launch is real. That's not vaporware. Somebody is spending real money opening custom mystery packs. Five app versions in four weeks shows the team can ship and iterate with intensity. And I'll admit the transparency angle tugs at something in my pattern recognition -- cryptographic verification of mystery pack odds is making an invisible system visible, which is the same instinct that drew me to Affirm replacing hidden credit card fees with transparent interest rates, or Carta replacing opaque cap tables with verifiable equity data. If you squint, there's a version of this that's the Affirm of collectibles: replacing "trust me, the odds are fair" with mathematical proof. That's genuinely interesting.

But the bull case requires me to believe several things simultaneously that I'm not sure I believe. First, that collectors actually care about cryptographic verification -- the trading card community runs on trust, relationships, and reputation, not zero-knowledge proofs. Second, that the regulatory minefield of real-money mystery packs with customizable odds won't become existential. The 18+ age rating tells me the founders are aware they're dancing near gambling classification, but awareness and expertise are different things. My IronPort background makes me comfortable with regulated spaces, but only when founders demonstrate deep regulatory sophistication, and I don't see that credential on either founder's resume. Third, that this isn't a consensus play dressed in contrarian clothing. Whatnot just raised at an $11.5 billion valuation. DOPA has 100,000 daily users in Japan and is expanding to the U.S. Trading card platforms are not an unpopular category that nobody else wants to fund -- they're a validated, competitive market with well-capitalized incumbents. The crypto/NFT tags on this company's YC page feel more like 2021 trend residue than the kind of genuinely weird conviction I'm drawn to.

The strongest version of the investment case would require Joseph to have a survival story I haven't seen, for the cryptographic transparency layer to become a consumer-facing trust standard that larger platforms can't easily replicate, and for the regulatory complexity to function as a moat rather than a death trap. If all three were true -- and if the Steph Curry collaboration unlocks distribution at scale -- this could become the trusted infrastructure layer for a multi-billion-dollar secondary market. That's a real outcome. But I'd need to sit across from Joseph and hear his actual story before I could feel that conviction. Right now, I see a smart Stanford grad building a well-executed consumer app in a crowded market without the biographical inevitability or the anti-consensus weirdness that triggers my pattern recognition. I'm not the right investor for this one.
