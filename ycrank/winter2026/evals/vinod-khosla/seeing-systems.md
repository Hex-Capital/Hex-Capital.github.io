# Seeing Systems -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what catches my attention: two brothers from Guernsey -- a tiny Channel Island with 63,000 people -- have UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces shipping their prototypes, and they've done it on $500K. Meanwhile, Stark raised $62M from Sequoia and Peter Thiel, and all four of their strikes failed in military trials. The capital-to-traction ratio here is remarkable. In defense, where getting a single meeting with a military procurement officer can take a year of security clearances and relationship-building, this level of customer access at pre-seed is not normal. It tells me Alexander's Wildcat I.S. background didn't just teach him embedded electronics -- it gave him the trust network that defense hardware companies spend tens of millions trying to build.

Now, the consequence question. If Seeing Systems succeeds at the scale they're articulating -- becoming the modular, software-upgradeable strike drone platform for NATO -- they'd be reshaping how Western military forces project power. Ukraine has already demonstrated that $500 FPV drones are neutralizing $5M armored vehicles. The defense industrial base is built on a structural assumption that expensive, exquisite platforms win wars. That assumption is collapsing in real time. A company that provides NATO with affordable, rapidly-iterating autonomous strike capability would displace not just other drone manufacturers but portions of the legacy defense architecture -- manned aircraft, traditional munitions, even some ground vehicle procurement. The European Commission has signaled nearly a trillion dollars for defense investment, with drones and AI as explicit priorities. The consequence magnitude is real. But I need to be honest: Seeing Systems isn't building the operating system for autonomous warfare. They're building drone platforms. The ceiling is high, but their stated ambition puts them in the "excellent defense contractor" category rather than the "restructures an industry" category. That's the difference between a $5B outcome and a $50B outcome.

The comparison that keeps surfacing for me is the Juniper dynamic -- not the return multiple, but the structural position. Cisco couldn't build TCP/IP routers because their business depended on proprietary protocols. Defense primes can't build $20K expendable drones because their Congressional support, workforce, and margins depend on $50M platforms. BAE and Lockheed have the same business model cannibalization problem that prevented Cisco from adapting. That structural misalignment creates genuine space for a startup. But Juniper had a specific, demonstrable technology advantage: TCP/IP routing was architecturally superior to legacy protocols, and Pradeep Sindhu could show you why. What is Seeing Systems' equivalent breakthrough? "Agentic AI control system" and "hardware modularity" are concepts, not demonstrated technical moats. Every defense AI startup -- Helsing, Shield AI, and a dozen Ukrainian companies with actual combat deployments -- is building autonomous control software. I see no published research, no GitHub repositories, no specific technical claims that distinguish their autonomy stack from what well-funded competitors are building with hundreds of engineers. The 2x lifecycle cost reduction claim on their YC page is unverified and, frankly, modest for a disruption play.

The timing argument is strong but has a problem: it's consensus. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, the AI community thought scaling was a dead end. When I backed cleantech in 2004, most VCs hadn't heard of carbon capture. Defense tech in 2026 is on the cover of every European business publication. Germany just awarded €900M in kamikaze drone contracts. Helsing raised €1.4 billion. This is not skating to where the puck will be -- this is arriving at a crowded rink. The underlying trend is real and accelerating, but the alpha from timing has largely been captured by earlier movers. What could make the timing argument work is if the *specific sub-segment* -- low-cost, expendable, modular platforms for NATO European forces -- is underserved by the larger players who are building bigger, more expensive systems. That's plausible but unproven.

Let me lay out what would have to be true for this to be a great investment. First, the agentic AI control system would need to be genuinely differentiated -- capable of operating autonomously in EW-contested, GPS-denied environments in ways that competitors' systems cannot. If the software is the moat, it needs to be demonstrably better, not just described differently. Second, the hardware modularity concept would need to translate into a real manufacturing and iteration speed advantage -- can they ship updated drone variants in weeks while competitors take months? Third, Alexander's military relationships would need to convert from prototype partnerships into production contracts, proving that the trust network scales into revenue. Fourth, they'd need to raise significant follow-on capital quickly -- you cannot build a hardware defense company on $500K, and the gap between their current funding and what manufacturing scale requires is existential. If all four are true, you have a company that could own the expendable autonomous drone category for NATO and build a multi-billion-dollar business. The team composition -- hardware founder plus software founder, self-taught practical engineering plus Cambridge/Jane Street rigor, both with defense sector proximity -- is sensibly constructed for the problem even if thin at two people.

This is a bet I'd watch but not write a check for today. The problem matters. The timing is favorable. The founders have extraordinary customer access for their stage. But three things hold me back: I don't see a technology breakthrough that creates structural advantage over far-better-funded competitors building adjacent solutions; the timing advantage is consensus rather than contrarian; and the capital requirements of a hardware defense company create a fragility that $500K cannot absorb. If I met the Le Maitres and saw evidence of rapid technical iteration -- new autonomy capabilities deployed monthly, unique approaches to EW resistance, or a modularity architecture that competitors can't replicate -- I might lean differently. Right now, the dossier shows me competent founders in a hot market without the kind of singular technical edge that turns a good defense startup into a category-defining company.
