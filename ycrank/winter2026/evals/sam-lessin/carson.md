# Carson -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Carson is the clearest illustration I've seen in this batch of exactly the kind of company I've been warning about on CNBC for the last two years. Their tagline -- "more capable than Cowork, more secure than OpenClaw" -- tells you everything you need to know. When your entire identity is defined by two competitors, your fate is defined by those competitors too. If Anthropic locks down Cowork's security (which they announced enterprise plugins for on February 24, 2026 -- literally the day this dossier was compiled) and OpenClaw gets properly sandboxed, what is Carson? A feature set that got absorbed before it launched. This isn't a business. It's a positioning statement waiting to expire.

Let me apply the test I keep coming back to: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer isn't just "no" -- the question doesn't even parse. If AI didn't exist, Carson wouldn't exist. The entire company IS the AI layer. There's no physical operation underneath it, no protocol other companies build on, no asset base generating real economics. This is the polar opposite of what I look for. When I backed Craftwork, I backed painting crews that happen to use software for scheduling. When I backed Metropolis, I backed parking infrastructure with installed hardware. Those businesses get stronger as AI gets cheaper because AI optimizes their operations without enabling competitors to replicate their physical moats. Carson gets weaker as AI gets cheaper because every incumbent with distribution -- Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce -- will ship equivalent security and adaptive UI features as table-stakes enterprise capabilities. The dossier's own commoditization risk section says it plainly: "a 4-person startup's feature set could be replicated by any of these incumbents."

The founders are smart -- I'll give them that. Sid Menon building secure deployment infrastructure at Palantir and Ketan Agrawal doing AI red-teaming at Robust Intelligence (acquired by Cisco) gives them genuine credibility on the security side. Milan Bhandari's prior YC experience with Bolto (YC S23, $5M+ raised) shows he can execute in the startup context. These are "sane" people. But they're chasing a sane idea. Building a secure enterprise AI agent isn't contrarian -- it's what literally every major technology company on earth is doing right now. Microsoft Copilot is already at $30/user/month with M365 integration. Glean is at $200M ARR. ServiceNow acquired Moveworks for $2.85B. Even in the startup layer, Runlayer already raised $11M and signed eight unicorn or public-company customers including Gusto, Instacart, and Opendoor. The "sane person, insane idea" framework produces outsized returns precisely because the idea is non-consensus -- when the idea is this consensus, the returns are already priced into a dozen other bets with better distribution and more capital.

The bull case, and I want to take it seriously: there's a structural argument that general-purpose AI agent companies face an inherent tension between capability maximization and security constraint. Anthropic wants Cowork to be maximally capable and open to drive consumer adoption, which conflicts with the tight scoping enterprises need. OpenClaw's open-source architecture structurally resists centralized policy enforcement. Maybe a clean-sheet enterprise agent, built security-first from the ground up, could own this category the way Slack owned enterprise messaging despite IRC existing. And the "adaptive task-specific interfaces" concept -- generating purpose-built UIs that constrain agent scope per task rather than giving a general-purpose agent access to everything -- is a genuinely interesting architectural idea. If enterprises truly can't use Cowork or OpenClaw for security reasons, and if Carson's adaptive UI approach proves meaningfully more productive than Runlayer's wrapper governance approach, there's a wedge. But this requires believing that Anthropic won't solve enterprise security (they're already working on it), that the wrapper approach fails (Runlayer's traction suggests otherwise), and that a 4-person pre-launch startup can out-distribute every major platform company in enterprise sales. That's three simultaneous bets against incumbents, and I've said clearly -- the winner of the AI race depends on distribution. Carson has a waitlist. Anthropic has a $380B war chest.

One more thing that nags me: Milan Bhandari left Bolto while it was still active and funded. The dossier notes Bolto raised over $5M and remains active as of March 2025. I don't know the circumstances, and there are legitimate reasons founders leave companies. But when I see a co-founder depart an active startup to launch a new one in a completely different category within two years, it triggers my "tizz" detector. Building a company requires maniacal, grinding operational focus over years. Helium took seven years from seed to unicorn. Solana required holding through an entire crypto winter. I need to see evidence of that grinding patience, and the pattern here points the other direction.

This is a pass. Credentialed team, deeply consensus idea, pure software moat in a category where I believe software moats are dissolving fastest, no traction, no revenue, no primitive or protocol position, and a competitive landscape that includes a $380B incumbent already addressing the exact gap Carson targets. I'd rather fund a painting company.
