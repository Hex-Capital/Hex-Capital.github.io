# Orthogonal -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Orthogonal is the competitive landscape, and it makes me cautious. Stripe and OpenAI launched ACP in September 2025. Coinbase and Cloudflare shipped x402. Google launched AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. When five of the largest infrastructure companies on the planet are all building agent payment products in the same 12-month window, you are not in a non-obvious market. You're in one of the most consensus-hot categories in technology right now. My best investments -- PagerDuty, Gusto, Checkr -- were in markets that triggered dismissive reactions from other investors. "Just alerting software." "Just payroll." "Just background checks." Nobody dismisses "payments for AI agents." Everyone sees it coming, and the players who see it coming have balance sheets measured in hundreds of billions.

The structural moment is real -- I don't dispute that. MCP launched in late 2024 and gave agents a common interface for tool-calling. Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex hit production usage in 2024-2025. AI agents consuming APIs is a genuine behavioral shift, not a speculative forecast. But a real structural moment with massive incumbent attention is fundamentally different from a real structural moment that incumbents are ignoring. When I backed Coinbase, legacy financial institutions were actively avoiding crypto -- the regulatory complexity was a deterrent, not an attractor. Here, the incumbents are racing toward the opportunity, not away from it. Orthogonal's argument is that they're building the aggregation layer above the protocol layer -- the marketplace, not the payment rails. That's a real distinction. But aggregation layers above infrastructure protocols are structurally vulnerable to the protocol winners adding discovery features themselves. Building the search engine on top of someone else's internet is a viable strategy only if the internet layer stays dumb. Stripe and Coinbase don't stay dumb.

The prior art concerns me too. API marketplaces for human developers have been tried repeatedly -- RapidAPI raised over $100 million and never produced a generational outcome. The bull case is that agent consumption patterns are fundamentally different from human developer patterns: agents need programmatic discovery, per-call billing, and unified authentication in ways that human developers (who read docs, create accounts, and manage their own keys) don't. That's a reasonable hypothesis. If true, it would make "API marketplace for agents" a genuinely new category rather than a rehash. But it requires that agents actually reach autonomous API consumption at scale -- browsing catalogs, selecting tools, and paying for calls without human intervention. We're not there yet. The current product serves human developers building agent workflows, which puts it closer to RapidAPI's historical position than to the truly agent-native future.

The strongest bull case: if Orthogonal achieves supply-side density before anyone else -- hundreds of quality APIs packaged as "Skills" with unified auth and billing -- that catalog becomes the distribution channel for the entire agentic tool ecosystem. The product-to-distribution trajectory is theoretically strong. Start with API aggregation, expand into workflow orchestration, monitoring, cost optimization, and eventually become the operating system for agent-to-API interactions. That's a real platform vision. And the founders have surgically precise domain experience for this -- Pickett built payments at Coinbase and billing infrastructure at Vercel; Sogut built APIs at Google including Maps and reCAPTCHA. A 2x ICPC World Finalist building API infrastructure is a credible technical signal. The co-founder pairing covers both halves of the product: one knows how money moves through developer platforms, the other knows how APIs get built and consumed at scale. If I were going to fund someone to build this, this team profile would be high on my list.

But the single-miracle test fails. Orthogonal needs two miracles: first, achieving marketplace liquidity (getting enough APIs that developers prefer unified access over direct integration), and second, surviving the competitive convergence of trillion-dollar companies building in the same space. Either one alone would be a challenging but plausible obstacle. Together they compound into the multi-miracle pattern I avoid. With 14 providers at launch, the marketplace flywheel hasn't even begun to spin, and the window before well-resourced competitors build their own aggregation layers may be measured in quarters, not years.

The technology cycle positioning is interesting but cuts both ways. They're building at exactly the right moment in the MCP adoption curve -- early enough to establish presence, late enough that real agent frameworks exist. But the dependency on MCP as the standard is a risk. If Google's UCP or another protocol displaces MCP, the integration layer needs to be rebuilt. And the "why now" that Orthogonal benefits from -- MCP plus production agent frameworks -- is the same "why now" that every competitor in this space shares. It's not a proprietary timing insight; it's a shared observation. When Harvey was building legal AI in 2022, almost nobody else was. Orthogonal is building agentic API infrastructure in 2025, and so is everyone else.
