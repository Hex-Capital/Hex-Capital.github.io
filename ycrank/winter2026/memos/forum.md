## The Idea

**Problem:** Attention — measured through search volume, social media engagement, and streaming data — is the primary driver of business success in the digital economy, yet there is no direct financial instrument to hedge or speculate on changes in cultural relevance. Marketers, media companies, talent managers, and traders currently rely on lagging indicators (ad spend ROI, brand surveys) or adjacent instruments (prediction markets for discrete events) to manage cultural and demand risk. There is no way to go long or short on continuous changes in how much the world cares about a topic, person, or brand.

**Approach:** Forum creates proprietary indices from search, social, and streaming data that quantify cultural attention across topics, people, and movements. Users can then go long or short on changes in these relevance indices, treating attention as a tradable asset class. The platform currently operates with simulated currency ($1,000 per user) while pursuing regulatory approval for real-money trading in the U.S. (YC company page).

**Differentiation:** Forum's core differentiator is its pursuit of a regulated exchange model in the United States, distinguishing it from crypto-native competitors:
- **Noise.xyz** operates on Base (Coinbase's Layer 2) as a crypto-based attention market, offering continuous relevance indexes on-chain rather than through a CFTC-registered exchange.
- **Zora Attention Markets** launched on Solana (Feb 17, 2026) as a decentralized token-based system where users deploy "Trends" for 1 SOL each (CoinDesk, Feb 18, 2026).
- **Polymarket/Kaito** is adding attention market contracts to its existing prediction market platform starting March 2026 (The Block, Feb 2026), using Kaito's mindshare/sentiment data.
- **Kalshi** is a CFTC-registered exchange focused on event contracts (sports, politics), but does not offer continuous attention-based indices.

Forum aims to create a new asset class rather than offer a prediction market with binary outcomes.

**Business Model:** No public pricing page was found on the website at time of research (the website returned only a placeholder page). [Inferred]: The most likely monetization path is transaction fees on trades (analogous to exchange fee models at Kalshi, which charges ~1.2% of trading volume per Sacra), potentially supplemented by data/index licensing fees given the proprietary attention indices the company builds.

**TAM/SAM:** No direct TAM estimate exists for "attention trading" as a standalone market. Adjacent market references:
- Global prediction market trading volumes exceeded $60 billion in 2025, a 400% increase from 2024 (CFTC rulemaking context, Sidley Austin, Feb 2026 via search snippet).
- Citizens Financial Group projects prediction market firm revenues will reach $10 billion by 2030, from ~$2 billion currently (Gambling Insider, 2026 via search snippet).
- Global digital advertising market — the broader arena where attention is monetized — was valued at $650 billion in 2025 (Precedence Research, 2025 via search snippet).

**GTM / Distribution:** [Inferred]: Most likely initial distribution path is direct-to-consumer via the web platform, starting with crypto-native and retail trading communities already familiar with prediction markets and attention markets. The simulated-currency product serves as a waitlist/engagement mechanism while regulatory approvals are pending. Post-regulation, distribution could expand to institutional users (hedge funds, media companies, ad agencies) seeking attention-based hedging instruments.

## Defensibility

**Regulatory moat (potential, not yet realized):** If Forum obtains CFTC designation as a registered Designated Contract Market (DCM), this would represent a significant structural barrier — obtaining DCM status is a lengthy, capital-intensive regulatory process. Kalshi, the only startup to obtain DCM status to date, spent years and millions in legal costs to achieve it. No other attention-market competitor is currently pursuing regulated exchange status in the U.S.

**Proprietary data/indices:** Forum's attention indices — built from search, social, and streaming data — could develop into a data moat over time if the indices become standard benchmarks (analogous to how S&P indices became the standard in equities). However, this is unproven at this stage.

**Network effects:** Trading exchanges exhibit liquidity-driven network effects — more traders attract more traders. This moat does not exist today as the platform is pre-launch with simulated currency only.

**Market structure:** The structural barrier for incumbents like Kalshi is business model focus: Kalshi derives 89% of its 2025 revenue from sports betting (Sacra), and pivoting to continuous attention indices would require building entirely new data infrastructure and index methodology outside its core competency. Crypto-native platforms (Noise, Zora) face a different structural barrier: they cannot operate as regulated U.S. exchanges without fundamental architectural changes. [Inferred]: Traditional financial exchanges (CME, ICE) could theoretically build attention-based derivatives but would face internal prioritization challenges given the nascent and unproven nature of the asset class.

**Commoditization risk:** The underlying data sources (Google Trends, social media APIs, streaming metrics) are publicly available, and multiple competitors are already building attention indices. Noise (1,300+ beta users), Zora, and Polymarket/Kaito are all building comparable products in the crypto ecosystem. The regulated U.S. exchange path is harder to replicate but not unique if a well-capitalized incumbent decides to pursue it.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Funding | Revenue/ARR | Key Differentiator vs. Forum |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Noise.xyz** | $7.1M seed led by Paradigm (The Block, Jan 2026) | Revenue unknown | Crypto-native (Base L2); 1,300+ beta users with 62% retention; continuous relevance indexes; not pursuing regulated exchange status |
| **Kalshi** | ~$1.7B total ($1B Series E at $11B valuation) (TechCrunch, Nov 2025) | $260M in 2025 (Sacra) | CFTC-registered DCM but focused on event contracts (90%+ sports betting); does not offer continuous attention indices |
| **Polymarket / Kaito** | Polymarket: $200M round at $1B valuation (Founders Fund); ICE invested up to $2B | Revenue unknown | Largest prediction market by volume ($21.5B in 2025); adding attention markets via Kaito partnership in March 2026; crypto-based, not regulated exchange |
| **Zora Attention Markets** | Zora (parent): prior funding not specified for attention product | Revenue unknown | Launched Feb 17, 2026 on Solana; token-based (1 SOL per Trend); early traction showed ~$200K trading volume and $70K market cap on day one (CoinDesk, Feb 18, 2026) |

### Why Now

- **Regulatory opening:** On January 29, 2026, CFTC Chairman Michael Selig announced a four-part agenda to "support the responsible development of event contract markets," withdrew a proposed ban on sports-related event contracts, and signaled imminent rulemaking (CNBC, Jan 29, 2026; Sidley Austin, Feb 2026). This creates a more favorable path for new exchange operators.
- **Prediction market explosion:** Total prediction market trading volumes reached $60 billion in 2025 (400% YoY growth), and monthly active users grew from ~4,000 in 2024 to 600,000+ by late 2025 (Gambling Insider, 2026 via search snippet). This establishes consumer comfort with speculative trading on non-financial outcomes.
- **Attention as an asset class gains traction:** Multiple well-funded entrants (Noise $7.1M, Polymarket/Kaito partnership, Zora) all launched attention-specific trading products in late 2025 through early 2026, indicating an emerging consensus around the concept.
- [Inferred]: The availability of real-time social and search data via APIs (Google Trends, X/Twitter, TikTok, YouTube) has reached a maturity point where constructing continuous attention indices is technically feasible at low cost.

**Co-founder relationship:** Both founders dropped out of university to build Forum together. No shared prior employer or university overlap is identifiable from public data. No public data on co-founder history.

**Founder-market fit:** Owen Botkin's background in long/short equities at Balyasny provides direct experience with the financial infrastructure, market microstructure, and regulatory landscape needed to build a trading exchange. Joseph Thomas's software engineering background across NASA, GEICO, and DreamwaveAI provides the technical foundation for building data pipelines and trading platform infrastructure. The combination of finance domain expertise and engineering capability covers the two core competencies needed for this venture. YC partner Jared Friedman is the assigned partner (YC company page).

## Key Risks

**Regulatory dependency:** Forum's entire value proposition rests on obtaining U.S. regulatory approval (likely CFTC DCM designation) for real-money trading on attention indices. The CFTC rulemaking process is ongoing with nearly 50 active legal cases against prediction markets (CFTC amicus brief, Feb 2026). Denial or significant delay would leave the company unable to generate revenue from its core product. Mitigation: The current CFTC leadership has signaled a more permissive stance toward event contracts (CNBC, Jan 29, 2026).

**Well-funded competition already live:** Noise.xyz ($7.1M seed, 1,300+ beta users), Polymarket/Kaito ($200M+ funding, $21.5B 2025 volume), and Zora have all launched attention trading products in the crypto ecosystem before Forum has gone live with real money. These competitors may establish liquidity network effects and user habits before Forum obtains regulatory approval. Forum's regulated approach may appeal to a different user base (institutional, U.S.-based retail), but the crypto competitors have a significant head start.

**Index manipulation and integrity risk:** Attention indices derived from social media, search, and streaming data are potentially susceptible to manipulation (bot activity, coordinated social media campaigns, SEO manipulation). If index integrity is compromised, it could undermine user trust and invite regulatory scrutiny. No public information on Forum's anti-manipulation methodology was found.

**Brand disambiguation:** "Forum" is an extremely common English word with numerous existing companies sharing the name (Forum Investment Group, Forum Ventures, Forum Capital Advisors, etc.), which creates SEO challenges and potential brand confusion in a consumer-facing product.

**Liquidity bootstrapping:** New exchanges face a chicken-and-egg problem: traders need liquidity to participate, but liquidity requires traders. As a two-person pre-revenue startup competing against platforms with billions in trading volume, bootstrapping sufficient liquidity to make markets functional is a structural challenge. The simulated-currency approach may partially address this pre-launch, but the transition to real-money markets will require a liquidity strategy.
