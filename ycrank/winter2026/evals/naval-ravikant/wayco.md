# Wayco -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about Wayco is the structural audacity of its business model — a 19-year-old solo founder with no legal background proposing to become a law firm itself, not just sell software to law firms. That's a first-principles move. If you're building a referral network for personal injury attorneys and referral fees run 25-33% of the attorney's fee on a $61.7B market, the economics of being a participant in the network rather than a vendor to it are obviously superior. Most founders would never consider it because the regulatory complexity is enormous — bar admissions, state-by-state ethical rules, unauthorized practice of law risk. But the willingness to even think this way tells me something about the founder's ambition architecture. The problem is that ambition architecture and domain knowledge are different things entirely.

My first filter is always specific knowledge — what does this founder know that can't be taught in a classroom or replicated by a smart generalist who spent six months studying the space? Here, the answer is essentially nothing related to legal referrals. Iqbol Temirkhojaev is clearly a technical prodigy — Olympiad gold medalist three times over, shipping products since age 13, an exit to the United Nations at 14. That's extraordinary general capability. But general capability is exactly what's general. His prior work was in augmented reality education apps and competitive coding. The dossier explicitly notes "no documented legal-domain expertise," and no legal advisors or domain-expert hires are identified. When I backed Evan Williams at Twitter, the investment thesis wasn't "Evan is smart and hardworking" — it was that Evan had spent years on Blogger understanding how humans want to communicate publicly, and that knowledge couldn't be replicated by anyone who hadn't lived it. A 19-year-old competitive coder who identified the PI referral market as a large, fragmented opportunity is doing market research, not expressing specific knowledge.

The leverage architecture has genuine potential, and it's the dimension where Wayco scores highest in my framework. A two-sided referral network for law firms creates matching leverage that individual attorneys can't replicate alone — each firm added makes the network more valuable for every other firm in that geography. That's real marketplace dynamics, and marketplace dynamics at scale produce genuine monopoly economics. The referral fee participation model (if Wayco becomes a law firm itself) means the company captures a percentage of case value rather than charging a flat SaaS fee — that's revenue that scales with the outcomes it produces, which is the right incentive structure. But the execution path undermines the leverage thesis: market-by-market rollout, cold-start density problems in each new geography, and state-by-state regulatory compliance all require proportional human effort. Each new market is essentially a restart. That's the opposite of code as leverage.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. Voice AI has crossed a quality threshold in the last 24 months that makes automated legal intake genuinely viable for the first time. The referral fee economy in PI alone is $5-6.5B annually — a market where the current process is literally attorneys calling other attorneys they personally know. If Wayco achieves density in even a few major metro markets, the network effects could be powerful, and the "become a law firm" strategy creates a regulatory moat that pure software companies won't pursue because they don't think that way. The $1.5M pre-seed from Sequoia Scout Fund and investors from ElevenLabs and Groq is meaningful signal at this stage. And Jared Friedman's public endorsement — from someone who co-founded Scribd and understands marketplace dynamics — is not nothing. The best version of this company is a permission-to-play infrastructure layer for how legal cases flow through the American legal system, capturing a fee on each transaction.

But the bear case is structural, not circumstantial. The core technology — VAPI, Twilio, LLMs, PostgreSQL — is commercially available. Smith.ai already offers AI receptionist services for law firms. Filevine has $400M in funding and 6,000 customers. Any incumbent could build voice-AI intake as a feature within their existing platform and reach their installed base faster than Wayco can cold-start a new market. The defensibility case rests entirely on network density and the law-firm-licensing strategy — neither of which exists yet. And legal AI is the consensus hot market of 2025-2026: investment hit an all-time high, adoption is at 79%, Harvey AI raised $800M+. This is not a contrarian bet. This is a founder chasing a hot market with commodity technology and no domain-specific knowledge to differentiate his approach. The timing is consensus, not contrarian. Everyone agrees legal AI is big — which means the asymmetric upside has already been competed away.

I respect the founder's raw capability and ambition. A 19-year-old from Tajikistan who has already shipped and exited twice possesses unusual energy and intelligence. But intelligence and energy without domain-specific knowledge in the target industry is a structural mismatch in my framework — not a timing issue that resolves with a few hires. The founder needs to know something about how PI referrals actually work, how attorneys make trust decisions about who to refer cases to, what breaks in the current process at a level of detail that only someone embedded in the system would understand. Without that, this is a smart person applying general technical ability to a market they identified from the outside. I pass on most of those.
