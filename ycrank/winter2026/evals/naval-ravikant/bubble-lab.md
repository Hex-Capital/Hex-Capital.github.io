# Bubble Lab -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the pivot trajectory. Selina and Zach co-founded gymii.ai -- an AI nutrition tracker -- in early 2025, then built Bubble Lab in the same year. That's not specific knowledge finding its expression. That's smart, energetic people searching for a market. There's nothing wrong with pivoting at pre-seed -- most great companies pivot -- but the specific knowledge test requires me to ask: what do these founders understand about operations workflow automation that someone couldn't learn in a quarter of focused research? Selina's JPMorgan quant background gives her exposure to enterprise tooling pain, but quant research is financial modeling, not ops orchestration. Zach has "eight years building automation-driven solutions" and is clearly a capable engineer. But the insight that "ops teams waste time on manual workflows across fragmented tools" is on every pitch deck in this category. It's not a secret. It's a slide.

The leverage question is where this falls apart for me. Bubble Lab is an application sitting on top of other people's leverage -- LLMs for the intelligence, Slack for the distribution, third-party APIs for the integrations. The company has 16 integrations. Zapier has 8,000+. The integration ecosystem *is* the leverage in workflow automation, and Bubble Lab is starting with a 500x disadvantage on the dimension that matters most. When I backed Replit, the leverage was fundamental: turning non-programmers into programmers creates a new category of human capability. Bubble Lab is making existing automation marginally easier to configure. That's a feature improvement on an existing category, not a new form of leverage. The Slack-native interface is genuinely clever distribution -- adding a bot to Slack has near-zero friction -- but distribution inside someone else's platform is rented leverage, not owned leverage. If Slack decides to build AI workflow automation natively (and they will), Bubble Lab becomes a tenant facing eviction.

The timing is consensus, not contrarian. "AI-powered automation" is perhaps the single most crowded category in 2026. Zapier has already shipped AI features. n8n raised $240M at a $2.5B valuation and is integrating LangChain across 70+ nodes. Make was acquired by Celonis for enterprise distribution. Activepieces is YC-backed, MIT-licensed, with 20K GitHub stars. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was *illegal*. When I invested in Bitcoin, it was considered a toy for cryptographers. Nobody was competing because nobody believed it would work. Here, every major player in the space is converging on exactly the same natural-language-to-API-call architecture that Bubble Lab is building. That's the opposite of contrarian -- it's a race where the company with the smallest integration ecosystem, the least brand recognition, and the newest codebase is competing against well-funded incumbents who are adding the same capability as a feature.

The bull case -- and I want to be fair about it -- rests on Pearl's long-term memory becoming genuine organizational intelligence. If every workflow, every preference, every shortcut Pearl learns creates compounding institutional knowledge that's painful to migrate, that's a real switching-cost moat. The 3,800 users at pre-seed is a non-trivial signal of demand. And there's a version of this story where the Slack-native conversational interface is so fundamentally better than drag-and-drop builders that it creates a new adoption curve among non-technical ops people who would never use Zapier. If that UX wedge is real and the memory layer compounds, you could build a meaningful business before incumbents figure out the conversational paradigm. But "could" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. The core technology -- LLM-mediated API orchestration -- is precisely the kind of capability that can be trained into a system, which by my own framework means it's not specific knowledge and it's not durable.

The open-source strategy contradicts itself. They open-sourced under Apache 2.0 but closed contributions in January 2026. So they bear the cost of transparency (competitors can fork the code) without the benefit of community-driven development. That's neither an open-source community play nor a proprietary technology play. It's a half-measure that gives away the code without building the network. Compare this to how Stack Overflow's open knowledge graph became more valuable with every question and answer, or how Notion's template ecosystem creates genuine community-driven compounding. Bubble Lab's architecture doesn't have that flywheel.

I like that Zach is technical and clearly the builder. I like the persistence of three YC applications. These are young, smart, hardworking people. But intelligence and energy without specific knowledge in a consensus market produces a feature, not a company. The workflow automation space will be transformed by AI -- that much is obvious to everyone. The question is whether the transformation will be led by a two-person startup with 16 integrations or by the incumbents who already own the integration layer and are actively building the same AI capabilities. I don't see the structural advantage that lets Bubble Lab win that race.
