# Voxel Energy -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

I need to be transparent about something before I say anything else: Crusoe Energy is one of my portfolio companies. I was there when it was a handful of weirdos trying to mine Bitcoin on stranded gas in North Dakota, and I was there when the company nearly died in 2020. So when I look at Voxel Energy — off-grid data centers powered by second-life EV batteries — I'm not evaluating this in a vacuum. I'm evaluating it knowing that Crusoe, with $3.9 billion in funding and a Redwood Materials partnership, is already building off-grid data centers using second-life batteries. The approach Voxel is pursuing was non-consensus five years ago. Today it's a category with multiple billion-dollar players. When every VC in town already understands why off-grid data center power matters, the price of being right goes down and the cost of competing goes up. The weirdness has been arbitraged away, and that's a problem for how I invest.

What I'd want to ask Casey, Max, and Evan before anything else is: tell me how you got here. Not the Tesla resume, not the Forbes list — how did you personally arrive at this? The dossier gives me strong credentials. Casey ran Tesla Autopilot projects for seven and a half years and founded three hardware companies. Max built Maxwell Vehicles, a legitimate EV manufacturing business that used second-life batteries — which is directly relevant domain expertise, not adjacent knowledge. Evan has a decade-plus managing real data center construction. This is a genuinely complementary team with the right technical DNA. But I don't hear the personal story underneath. I don't feel the biographical thread where someone's life experience made them unable to NOT solve this problem. Max's Maxwell Vehicles background comes closest — he's already lived inside the second-life battery supply chain and understands degradation curves and sourcing challenges in a way most people in this space don't. That's real. But "I built EVs with used batteries and now I want to power data centers with them" is a logical career progression, not the kind of obsessive mission that survives the inevitable crises of building capital-intensive infrastructure at this scale.

The bull case is genuine, and I want to honor it. The DC-native microgrid architecture — cutting energy loss from 30% to roughly 4% by eliminating AC-to-DC conversion — is a real technical insight, not marketing. GPUs run on DC power natively, and the entire industry converts AC to DC at every stage, wasting enormous amounts of energy. Someone who builds the full stack in DC from generation to computation has a structural efficiency advantage. "Thousands of acres already under contract" at the pre-seed stage shows remarkable execution velocity. And the timing argument is as strong as I've ever seen for infrastructure: utility interconnection queues stretching past five years, $3 trillion in planned data center projects, half of which may never get built because of power constraints. If you can go from vacant lot to powered data center in months rather than years, that's not incremental — that's transformative. The second-life battery supply angle is also elegant: it turns a growing waste stream into a cost advantage while everyone else is fighting over new battery supply.

But here's where my framework creates friction. I backed SpaceX as my very first angel check when private space was considered insane — that was a genuinely generational infrastructure bet against consensus, and Elon's intensity overrode every concern I had about capital requirements. For me to make a capital-intensive infrastructure bet, I need either the anti-consensus signal (this looks crazy to everyone else) or the founder intensity signal (this person will will this into existence through sheer force). Voxel gives me neither at a strong enough amplitude. The category is validated. The founders are competent and experienced but not radiating the kind of relentless energy that makes me want to drop everything and help. And the competitive landscape is brutal — Crusoe at $3.9B, Lancium at $1.25B, Exowatt at $140M. Entering this race at pre-seed requires something extraordinary, and I'm not finding that extraordinary element in what I can see.

What would make me wrong? If the DC-native architecture turns out to be genuinely difficult to replicate — not just an engineering choice but a deep systems integration challenge that the bigger players can't easily adopt because their existing infrastructure is built around AC. If Max's second-life battery expertise gives them a sourcing and management advantage that Crusoe's Redwood Materials partnership can't match. If the modular, smaller-scale approach finds a market segment (edge AI, smaller GPU cloud providers) that the gigawatt-scale players like Lancium and Crusoe are too big to serve efficiently. Those are real possibilities, and five years from now I might look back at this and wish I'd written the check. But conviction investing means being honest about where my conviction actually is, and right now, without the biographical grit signal I rely on most and without the anti-consensus weirdness that pulls me into a deal, this doesn't clear my bar.
