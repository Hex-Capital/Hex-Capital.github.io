# Ressl AI -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The pivot is the most revealing signal here. Ressl AI had a functioning Salesforce AI product generating $440K in revenue, and they walked away from it to enter trades back-office automation -- a vertical where they have zero demonstrated traction and face Netic, which has $43M from Founders Fund and Greylock at a $450M valuation with 1,700% revenue growth. This decision is either an act of exceptional market pattern recognition -- the founders saw denser glue work and weaker incumbents in trades than in Salesforce admin -- or it's a classic case of chasing a hotter narrative while abandoning validated revenue. The dossier doesn't provide enough evidence to distinguish between these scenarios, and that ambiguity is the core issue.

The market archetype superficially fits my pattern. Trades back-office operations -- estimating, procurement, insurance coordination for HVAC shops and collision repair businesses -- is exactly the kind of "too boring" infrastructure that I've backed successfully with PagerDuty and Gusto. Every plumber and electrician needs this. The operators are non-technical, the legacy tools are terrible, and the work is repetitive. When I walked into the first few companies that became PagerDuty investments, other VCs dismissed operations alerting as niche and unglamorous. That's the archetype. But here's what's different: when I backed those companies, the market was still being dismissed. Trades AI is no longer being dismissed. Founders Fund led Netic's round at $450M. ServiceTitan is publicly traded and shipping AI Voice Agents and SMS Booking Agents into their existing customer base. Avoca has traction in call handling. The "boring market" has been discovered and priced, which fundamentally changes the investment calculus. A non-obvious market that's become obvious to Founders Fund is just... a market.

The PE roll-up distribution channel is the most interesting strategic insight in the pitch. One relationship with a PE firm rolling up collision shops or HVAC businesses could unlock deployments across dozens of locations simultaneously, and PE firms have explicit margin-improvement mandates that make "replace 2-4 back-office workers with AI agents" a natural sell. This is genuine distribution thinking -- not "word of mouth" but a structured channel with economic alignment. It reminds me of how Gusto initially targeted accountants as a distribution channel to reach small businesses. If Ressl can land even two or three PE portfolio relationships, the compounding effect could be significant. But this remains entirely theoretical. There's no evidence of a single PE relationship closed or a single trades business using the current product. The distribution thesis is sound in structure but unvalidated in practice, and Netic -- with 80x the capital -- is pursuing overlapping customers.

The bull case I'd want to believe: the full back-office scope (quoting, estimating, procurement, insurance coordination, scheduling, invoicing) is genuinely broader than what Netic or Avoca are building. Netic focuses on revenue operations; Avoca focuses on inbound calls. If Ressl can stitch together the complete operational layer across a shop's existing tools, they become the operating system for trades businesses rather than a point solution. The integration complexity across fragmented legacy software (CCCOne for collision, QuickBooks for invoicing, different scheduling tools per sub-vertical) is actually a moat if they can crack it -- domain-specific workflow encoding takes time to replicate. And the founders' demonstrated ability to ship a revenue-generating product ($440K on Salesforce AI) suggests they can build. The question is whether they can build fast enough, in an unfamiliar vertical, with $500-750K, against a competitor with $43M and a 12-month head start. That math is hard.

The single-miracle test is where this gets muddled. The miracle should be: "Can AI agents reliably execute multi-step trades back-office tasks across heterogeneous legacy software?" That's a reasonable single miracle. But the pivot introduces a second implicit miracle: "Can we build domain expertise and customer relationships in a vertical we just entered, fast enough to compete with funded incumbents?" Two miracles compound low-probability events. The founders' Salesforce experience demonstrates software agent construction capability -- that's transferable. What's not transferable is the domain knowledge of how collision repair estimating actually works, how insurance coordination flows differ between HVAC and plumbing, or what shop operators actually need versus what looks good in a demo. Each sub-vertical is almost its own integration project. That's not one miracle -- it's a sequence of them.

I pass. The market is real but no longer non-obvious. The distribution thesis is clever but unproven. The competitive dynamics -- Netic at $43M, ServiceTitan adding AI features to its existing install base -- create structural headwinds that a $500K company with zero traction in the current vertical will struggle to overcome. The founders show execution ability, and the PE roll-up channel could be high-leverage, but I need to see at least one proof point in the actual trades market before this becomes my kind of bet. If they come back in six months with three PE portfolio deployments and measurable labor cost reduction data, the conversation changes entirely.
