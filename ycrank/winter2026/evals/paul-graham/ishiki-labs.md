# Ishiki Labs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Ishiki Labs is that this is an AI meeting copilot -- one of the most crowded categories in enterprise software right now. Otter.ai has $100M ARR. Fireflies just hit unicorn status. Read.ai raised $81M. Granola raised $67M. When I see a pre-seed company entering a space where four incumbents have collectively raised over $230M and serve tens of millions of users, my schlep blindness detector fires in reverse. The whole point of schlep blindness is that the best opportunities are in places smart people unconsciously avoid. AI meeting assistants are the opposite. This is a category that *attracts* smart people because the problem is obvious, the market is proven, and the technology is intellectually stimulating. That's a warning sign.

The founders' backstory is where things get more interesting, and it's the reason I haven't stopped reading. Amit Yadav was on Meta's LLaMA team training multimodal LLMs and in Reality Labs building video assistants for smart glasses. Robert Xu spent four years at Meta building orchestration infrastructure for running multimodal AI on Orion AR glasses, optimizing for latency and compute. They didn't google "hot AI markets" -- they spent years inside one of the most ambitious multimodal AI programs in the world and identified a specific gap: these systems can see and hear, but they have no social awareness. They interrupt. They can't tell who you're talking to. That's a genuine insight born from lived technical experience, and it earns real credit. But there's a subtlety that matters. The gap they identified -- social awareness in multimodal AI -- is a capability insight, not a user pain point. When Drew Houston forgot his USB drive, he was the suffering user. When the Collisons tried to integrate payments, they were the frustrated developer. Amit and Robert identified that a technology they were building had a missing capability. That's closer to "technology looking for a market" than "problem looking for a solution." The meeting copilot feels like a chosen landing zone -- a sensible first application for their expertise -- rather than an organic discovery of broken meetings.

The technical depth here is genuinely impressive and worth dwelling on. A PhD from Purdue with 20+ publications at CVPR, NeurIPS, and ICASSP is not a checkbox credential -- that's a researcher who has spent years pushing the boundaries of multimodal ML. Robert's four years of production systems work at Meta, building the actual infrastructure that makes real-time multimodal inference work on constrained hardware, is the systems engineering complement that turns research into product. This is a founding team that can build their own product at the highest level. When I apply my "animal test" -- would I describe these founders as animals at their craft? -- the answer for the technical dimension is yes. These are people who have operated at the frontier of the exact technology their company requires.

The bull case is this: social awareness in AI -- the ability to track conversational context, infer speaker intent, and know when silence is the right response -- might be a genuinely hard research problem that can't be solved by bolting a "listen-only mode" onto Otter.ai. If it requires the kind of deep multimodal understanding that Meta invested years and billions into, then Ishiki Labs' founders carry rare knowledge that creates a real moat. The meeting copilot would be the wedge product; the underlying social awareness capability could become a platform layer that other applications build on. And the Stripe analogy works partially: the Collisons identified a capability gap (clean payment APIs) from their position as developers, not as merchants suffering directly. Amit and Robert identified a capability gap (social awareness) from their position as builders, not as meeting sufferers. If the social awareness layer proves as fundamental as Stripe's payment abstraction proved, this could be much bigger than meetings.

But I keep coming back to the competitive structure, and it bothers me. The differentiation surface is thin. "Knows when not to speak" is one feature, not a product category. Microsoft Copilot is already doing real-time meeting assistance inside Teams. OpenAI and Google are investing billions in voice mode capabilities, and adding social context awareness is an incremental improvement for them, not a company-building effort. When Stripe launched, banks couldn't build developer-friendly APIs -- it was structurally incompatible with how banks operated. There's no equivalent structural barrier preventing Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet from adding social awareness to their native AI features. The schlep here isn't regulatory or logistical -- it's technical, and technical schleps in AI tend to get solved by whoever has the most compute and data. There's also zero evidence of user pull. No users, no waitlist, no revenue, no prototype demo mentioned. At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of traction, but I also can't give credit for something that doesn't exist yet.

These are strong founders with rare expertise entering a market where that expertise may not be enough. The meeting assistant category is a war of distribution and data network effects, not a war of research depth. Otter.ai's 25 million users generate training data that improves their product daily. The best social awareness model in the world doesn't help if you can't get it in front of users faster than incumbents can close the gap. I'd want to see Fern working in actual meetings, with evidence that the social awareness capability creates a qualitatively different experience that users can't get elsewhere. Right now, I'm looking at two exceptional researchers with a capability insight searching for product-market fit in one of the most competitive categories in enterprise AI.
