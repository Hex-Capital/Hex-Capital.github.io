# Orthogonal -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

When every major payments company on the planet is simultaneously announcing agent payment protocols -- Stripe with ACP, Coinbase with x402, Visa with Intelligent Commerce, Mastercard with Agent Pay, Google with AP2 -- and you're a two-person team building an API marketplace in the same airspace, you're not contrarian. You're consensus. And consensus at pre-seed means the pricing of your competition has already absorbed the optimism you're hoping to capture. The "agentic payments" category in 2026 looks like the AI chatbot category looked in 2023: everyone sees it coming, everyone is building, and the question isn't whether the market exists but whether a startup can survive between protocol-layer giants below and agent-framework platforms above. Coinbase's x402 is already processing 156,000 weekly transactions. That's not a whitepaper -- that's traction with institutional backing. Orthogonal's positioning above the protocol layer ("we aggregate, they settle") is the obvious complementary play, which means every smart observer has already thought of it.

The founder knowledge question is instructive but not decisive. Pickett did payments at Coinbase and billing infrastructure at Vercel. Sogut built reCAPTCHA and Maps APIs at Google, with two ICPC World Finals appearances confirming genuine technical depth. The pairing is clean -- one founder understands payment plumbing, the other understands API plumbing. But this is career-path knowledge assembled from strong résumés, not the kind of non-transferable insight that takes years of obsessive curiosity to develop. When I backed Evan Williams, his specific knowledge about public communication had been accreting since Blogger -- it couldn't have been assembled by a recruiter. Here, a sufficiently motivated team lead at any major fintech could identify the same opportunity and bring comparable domain context. The ICPC credentials signal that Sogut is a genuinely strong engineer, which clears my "technologist on the founding team" bar. But competitive programming is a skill, not specific knowledge about how agents will consume APIs at scale. I'd want to hear what these founders know about this problem that would surprise me -- what non-obvious insight they've formed from building payments at Coinbase and APIs at Google that contradicts conventional wisdom.

The infrastructure positioning is the part that activates my framework. I've systematically backed picks-and-shovels plays -- AngelList for funding, CoinList for token distribution, Alchemy for blockchain development, Stack Overflow for developer knowledge. An API aggregation and payment layer for agents is structurally similar: sit between supply (API providers) and demand (agent developers), take a margin on transactions, and let both sides scale without you scaling headcount proportionally. That's genuine leverage architecture. The single-key abstraction creates modest switching costs, and the marketplace dynamics could compound if they achieve supply-side density. My CoinList investment worked because we became the infrastructure layer for token launches -- once projects listed with us, the network effects of buyer-side liquidity made us the default. Orthogonal could become the default API discovery layer for agents -- but only if they reach critical mass before the protocol-layer players add discovery features themselves. With 14 providers at launch, they're far from that threshold.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement: if MCP becomes the standard tool-calling interface (and Anthropic's backing gives it momentum), then the company building the best MCP-native API marketplace wins a structural position. The "why now" is real -- agents need APIs, APIs need agents, and nobody has built the connective tissue at the marketplace layer. Pickett's Coinbase background could mean they build natively on x402, becoming the aggregation layer on top of the winning payment protocol. If they achieve supply-side density before Skyfire or Nevermined pivot from payment rails to marketplace, the two-sided network effects could create a defensible position. The $10 free credits and MCP server integration are smart distribution wedges. This could be the company that makes me regret passing -- but only if the aggregation layer turns out to be harder to build than I think it is, and only if the protocol players don't add discovery features in their next release.

Where I land: the founders have relevant experience, not specific knowledge. The market is real but consensus. The infrastructure positioning appeals to my instincts, but the technology doesn't compound in a distinctive way -- wrapping APIs and processing payments is moderate technical complexity that a well-resourced competitor could replicate. The dependence on MCP as a distribution channel adds platform risk that the founders don't control. And the competitive landscape includes companies with $7-10M already raised, plus protocol-level players with effectively unlimited capital. I look for asymmetric upside -- bets where my losses are 1x and my gains are uncapped. Here, the upside is real but contested, and the most likely outcome is that a larger player absorbs this functionality into their existing platform before Orthogonal reaches escape velocity.
