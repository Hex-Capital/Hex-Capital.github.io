# Congruent -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what catches my attention immediately: two radar engineers who spent years inside Zendar -- a company that raised nearly $60 million building software-defined radar for the current ADAS paradigm -- and then walked away because they believed the entire industry, their own employer included, was building for an architecture that's about to become obsolete. That's a specific kind of conviction I recognize. It's not the biographical survival story I typically start with, and I'll be honest, I don't have that story here. What I have instead is an insider defection -- two people who were close enough to the problem to see around the corner, and who had the nerve to leave a well-funded company to bet on what comes next. That's not the same as the kind of grit I usually filter for, but it's not nothing.

The technical insight itself has a quality I've learned to pay attention to: it sounds counterintuitive to people inside the industry. The entire automotive radar market -- Continental, Bosch, Denso, all of them -- has spent decades building competitive advantage around how they process radar signals. Their intellectual property IS the processing. Congruent is saying: stop processing. Give the neural network the raw signal and let it learn. That's the kind of thing that makes incumbents deeply uncomfortable, because if it's right, their core differentiator becomes an obstacle. I've seen this pattern before -- when the thing a company has built its business around becomes the thing that prevents them from adapting. The tight coupling of raw-data hardware with a generative simulator for synthetic training data creates a system-level integration that you can't just bolt together from off-the-shelf components, and that's where the defensibility lives.

What I uniquely notice is how this maps to a pattern I keep coming back to: making invisible systems visible. Raw radar data is literally the hidden layer underneath every processed point cloud that current ADAS systems consume. Congruent is saying there's critical information being thrown away in that processing step, and end-to-end networks need to see it. That's structurally similar to what Carta did for cap tables, or what Affirm did for interest rates -- pulling back the curtain on data that was being compressed, filtered, or hidden by incumbent processes. It's also an infrastructure bet at a technological inflection point, which is the pattern behind my Crusoe and SpaceX investments, even though I don't usually frame it that way. If end-to-end architectures are where autonomy is going -- and Tesla's FSD v12 replacing 300,000 lines of modular code with a single neural network is a strong directional signal -- then someone needs to build the sensor infrastructure that feeds those networks. That someone doesn't exist yet for radar.

But I have real concerns that keep me from leaning forward the way I'd want to. First, I don't have the founder story. I know Clement has a PhD from Berkeley and was CTO at Safehub. I know Evan has a PhD in geophysics from UT Austin and a NASA internship. These are accomplished, credentialed people. But when I ask myself "tell me your story -- not the business," I don't hear the answer. I don't know what hardship forged their commitment to this specific problem. Career expertise is valuable, but it's different from the kind of biographical stake that tells me someone will keep going when the automotive qualification cycles drag past year three and the Tier-1 suppliers start circling. Second, the economic access dimension is thin. If autonomous vehicles eventually make transportation safer and cheaper, that benefits everyone -- but Congruent is several layers of abstraction removed from putting money in someone's pocket or making an opaque system transparent to everyday people. They're building infrastructure for infrastructure. Third, autonomous vehicles are one of the most consensus-funded categories in tech history. The specific niche Congruent occupies is non-consensus, but the broader sector is not the kind of unpopular, dismissed territory where I do my best work.

The bull case I genuinely respect: if end-to-end architectures become the standard for autonomous driving beyond Tesla, and if radar remains essential as the only all-weather depth sensor at mass-market price points, then Congruent is building something that every major AV program will need and that no one else is providing. The founding team has exactly the right background -- years of radar engineering at Zendar, a founding ML scientist with published work in diffusion-based generative models -- to execute on this specific technical challenge. The 2-5 year automotive qualification cycle that scares away other startups would become Congruent's moat once they get through it. And the fact that zero competitors are targeting this exact problem -- raw radar data plus generative simulator for end-to-end training -- means the timing window is genuinely open. If this works, it could look obvious in retrospect, which is what the best infrastructure bets always do.

Where I land: this is a technically sound company with a genuinely contrarian insight, built by people with deep domain credibility, operating in a space whose regulatory complexity I'm comfortable with. But it doesn't activate my primary filters. I don't feel the biographical urgency. The economic access angle is too distant. And while the specific insight is non-consensus, it lives inside a sector that's as consensus as it gets in venture. I'd want to meet these founders -- I'd want to hear what drove them to this, not just professionally but personally. Right now, on paper, this is a company I respect more than I feel pulled toward.
