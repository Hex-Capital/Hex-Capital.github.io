# Synthetic Sciences -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Two eighteen-year-olds with 15+ papers across ICML, IEEE, and ACL, research stints at MIT CSAIL, CMU, Harvard, Oxford, Berkeley, and Cambridge, an IOAI medal, USACO Platinum -- building into a category where Periodic Labs just raised $300M, Edison Scientific raised $70M, Elicit has $33M and ~$20M ARR, and Google shipped its own AI Co-Scientist on Gemini 2.0. That's the core tension. The founders are genuinely impressive for any age, let alone eighteen. But "AI for science" in 2026 is not a contrarian bet. It's a consensus stampede. Anyone in this business chasing hot markets gets killed -- not because the market is wrong, but because the pricing already reflects the optimism. When every smart investor agrees a category is transformative, the asymmetric upside has already been competed away.

The specific knowledge question is where I get stuck. Aayam Bansal's publication record is real -- three ICML Student Research Workshops, multi-institutional research spanning ML, NLP, and computer vision. Ishaan Gangwani's IOAI performance and USACO Platinum demonstrate serious algorithmic depth. They know the pain of computational research workflows because they've lived inside them for the past few years. But here's the distinction I keep returning to: knowing the pain of a workflow is different from possessing knowledge that can't be taught. Every prolific ML researcher at a top lab knows that literature review is tedious, experiment orchestration is manual, and paper writing is slow. That's not a secret -- it's the universal complaint of every PhD student at NeurIPS. The Sciloop founders, one YC batch ahead, are International Physics Olympiad medalists from MIT CSAIL with the same insight and comparable credentials. When the specific knowledge you're building on is widely shared across your entire target market, you're in a feature race, not a knowledge moat.

The leverage architecture looks like an integration layer, not a new category of leverage. Ninety-three pre-built skills. Twelve service integrations -- Hugging Face, Modal, Lambda GPU, Pinecone, Together AI, Groq. The individual components are commodity: LLM-based agents, GPU orchestration APIs, paper search endpoints. The value proposition is bundling -- a single interface across the research pipeline. Bundling is real but fragile. It doesn't create leverage in the way I think about it -- one engineer's work producing disproportionate output that compounds. It creates convenience, which is valuable but defensible only until someone with more resources bundles better. The data flywheel claim -- product usage generating RL training data for more autonomous agents -- is the most interesting technical thesis in the dossier. If it works, it's genuine compounding technology. But there are no published benchmarks, no community adoption metrics, no evidence the flywheel is spinning. It's an aspiration dressed as a moat.

The bull case I take seriously: these founders are digital natives who think in LLM-mediated workflows the way my generation thinks in spreadsheets. They started publishing at fifteen or sixteen. They've already had one exit, however small. They're backed by Z-Fellows, Emergent Ventures, and Gustaf Alstromer at YC. If you believe the winning AI-for-science company will be built by people who grew up inside AI research rather than people who pivoted into it -- and if you believe the full-pipeline approach (literature through compute-orchestrated experimentation through paper generation) is the right product surface while Elicit stays stuck at literature synthesis -- then these are plausibly the right founders for a company that compounds over a decade. The $50/month entry point is smart PLG for individual researchers. And being 18 means they have time to iterate through multiple product cycles while their competitors' first hires are still vesting.

But I keep returning to the structural problem: this is an application sitting on top of other people's infrastructure -- Hugging Face's models, Modal's compute, OpenAlex's literature graph. The company doesn't own the substrate. When I backed Stack Overflow, the knowledge graph *was* the product -- each question and answer made the moat deeper. When I backed Replit, the development environment *was* the leverage. Here, the leverage lives in the services they integrate with. If Modal changes its API, if Together AI changes pricing, if Hugging Face builds its own research orchestration layer -- the integration surface becomes a vulnerability, not an asset. The dual-naming confusion (InkVell for "document productivity" becoming Synthetic Sciences for "AI co-scientists") also suggests the founders are still searching for their specific bet rather than executing on deep conviction about a particular problem. That's not unusual at pre-seed, but it weakens the founder-problem authenticity signal.

I respect the founders' raw capability. If I met them, I'd probably like them -- they're clearly high-intelligence, high-energy people building something they personally want to exist. But the honest assessment through my framework is: widely-shared domain knowledge, integration-layer leverage, consensus timing, and commodity technology in a category where competitors have raised 200x their capital. The data flywheel thesis could change this calculus if demonstrated, but today it's a claim, not evidence. I'd want to see it again in a year -- if the flywheel is producing measurably better research agents than anyone else can build, the entire evaluation changes. For now, it's a pass.
