# Carson -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most striking thing about Carson isn't the product or the team -- it's the competitive timing problem. Runlayer closed an $11M seed from Khosla and Felicis and already has eight unicorn and public-company customers including Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor. Anthropic announced enterprise plugins and connectors for Cowork on February 24, 2026. Microsoft Copilot is at $30/user/month with full M365 integration. ServiceNow absorbed Moveworks for $2.85B. Carson is pre-launch, pre-revenue, with no public product, entering a market where the initial winners are already consolidating distribution. When I invested in Harvey, the team was building ahead of the capability curve -- positioning before the market was legible. Carson is positioning after the entire security industry, from Gartner to CrowdStrike, has already published their analysis of the problem. That's a fundamentally different competitive posture.

The structural moment here is real but completely consensus. Yes, OpenClaw's rapid adoption (~300K-400K users) combined with its "insecure by default" designation from Gartner created a genuine enterprise gap. Yes, Cowork's prompt-injection vulnerability within 48 hours of launch validated that even Anthropic can't solve enterprise security trivially. But when CrowdStrike is releasing detection tools and Meta is banning agents company-wide, every enterprise software company, every security vendor, and every VC on Sand Hill Road can see this gap. This is the opposite of PagerDuty, where operations alerting seemed boring and niche and the TAM looked small. The "secure enterprise AI agent" category is the hottest consensus market in B2B software right now. I specifically look for markets that trigger dismissive reactions from other investors. This market triggers the opposite -- everyone is excited about it.

The product-to-distribution trajectory has theoretical appeal but no concrete evidence. Carson's adaptive, task-specific UI generation -- creating a lead qualification dashboard for one task and a slide builder for another -- could become a platform for distributing multiple enterprise workflow products. That structural possibility exists. But the tagline "more capable than Cowork, more secure than OpenClaw" reveals a positioning problem: they're defining themselves relative to two other products rather than describing a distribution wedge. Stripe didn't position as "easier than PayPal" -- it built a developer API that became the distribution channel for a dozen products. I don't see evidence that these founders have thought about how Carson becomes a channel rather than a product. The demo-booking, sales-assisted motion is fine for enterprise, but it's a go-to-market tactic, not a distribution strategy.

The multi-miracle problem is what would keep me from writing a check. Carson needs to simultaneously: (1) build an agent that is genuinely more capable than one built by the $380B company that makes the underlying models, (2) achieve enterprise-grade security that satisfies procurement teams, (3) win enterprise sales against Runlayer (which already has distribution) and Glean ($200M ARR), and (4) do all of this before Anthropic closes its own enterprise security gap. That's at least three miracles compounding. The "more capable than Cowork" claim is particularly concerning -- you're asserting you can out-build Anthropic's own agent on top of Anthropic's own models. That's not one miracle, it's an ongoing race against the model provider. When the foundation model company can add task-specific interfaces to their own agent product, your differentiation is a feature, not a structural barrier.

The strongest bull case: the team has unusually relevant founder-market fit. Sid Menon built secure deployment infrastructure at Palantir. Ketan Agrawal worked on AI red-teaming at Robust Intelligence, which was literally acquired by Cisco for its AI security capabilities. Milan has prior YC founding experience with Bolto (S23, $5M+ raised). If you believe that enterprise AI agent security will fragment into a category where best-of-breed startups beat platform plays -- the way CrowdStrike beat Symantec by being security-native rather than security-as-a-feature -- then Carson's security-first architecture could win against Anthropic's bolted-on enterprise features. The task-specific adaptive UI approach is genuinely different from Runlayer's wrapper model and could create deeper workflow integration. If Carson ships fast, gets SOC 2 certification before competitors, and builds compliance infrastructure that becomes a switching cost, the regulatory moat pattern I've seen work at Coinbase and Anduril could apply here. That's the path to a real company. But it requires the market to reward a purpose-built agent over incumbents adding security layers -- and the evidence so far, with Runlayer already signing enterprise customers with a simpler wrapper approach, suggests enterprises may prefer the pragmatic solution over the architecturally pure one.

I'm passing. The market is real but consensus-obvious. The competitive dynamics are brutal for a pre-launch entrant. The product positioning as "more capable than X, more secure than Y" is a feature comparison, not a distribution thesis. And the plan requires multiple miracles against opponents who have already started winning. Relevant team backgrounds and a genuine structural gap aren't enough when every well-resourced competitor in enterprise software can see the same gap and is already shipping solutions.
