# Crosslayer Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a team that invented a global internet security standard — MPIC — that now governs the issuance of 8 million HTTPS certificates every day, and the CA/Browser Forum unanimously mandated it. That is extraordinary. In forty years of investing, I can count on one hand the number of pre-seed companies where the founders literally wrote the rules that govern a piece of the internet's trust infrastructure. Henry Birge-Lee coded the first implementation in 2016, published the foundational paper at USENIX in 2018, and co-authored the regulatory ballot that made it law. Prateek Mittal won the ACM Grace Hopper Award for this body of work. The knowledge moat here is real — you cannot replicate a decade of published research at USENIX Security and ACM CCS, nor can you replicate the relationships with Google, Apple, Let's Encrypt, and Sectigo that come from having co-authored the standard they must now implement. That is a genuinely rare asset at any stage.

But I have to ask the question I always ask first: if Crosslayer Labs succeeds completely — captures the entire market they're targeting — what changes? The answer is that enterprises get better monitoring of BGP hijacking, DNS hijacking, TLS misissuance, and JavaScript supply chain attacks. The attack surface management market reaches maybe $5 billion by 2034. A fully successful Crosslayer becomes a well-defended, highly respected cybersecurity SaaS company worth perhaps $1-3 billion. That is a fine outcome for most investors. It is not the kind of outcome I optimize for. Nobody's world changes. The internet still runs on BGP. Enterprises still get attacked. Crosslayer makes the monitoring better — genuinely better, through cross-layer signal correlation that no one else does natively. But "better monitoring" is not "replacing the system." When I backed Juniper, the thesis was that TCP/IP routing would make Cisco's entire architecture obsolete. When I backed Impossible Foods, the thesis was that plant-based heme would make animal agriculture unnecessary. Crosslayer is not making anything obsolete. It is watching for failures in systems that will continue to exist exactly as they are. The consequence of maximum success is a very good business, not an industry transformation.

The founder profile gives me a second concern, though it cuts both ways. These are the ultimate domain experts — they did not stumble into internet security from biochemistry or rocket engineering. They have spent a decade inside the protocols, publishing papers, attending standards body meetings, building relationships with certificate authorities. My pattern is to back outsiders — people who do not know what the industry considers impossible and therefore attempt it anyway. Birge-Lee and Cimaszewski know exactly what is possible and impossible in BGP and TLS security because they defined the boundaries. That depth is a genuine competitive advantage for building a monitoring product, but it also constrains ambition. They are building the logical, expert-driven commercial extension of their research. That is what industry veterans do — and my portfolio evidence says industry veterans aim for 5% annual improvement rather than inventing new markets. Now, I will grant that the original MPIC research itself was contrarian. In 2016, almost nobody was talking about BGP attacks on certificate issuance as a serious threat vector. Birge-Lee demonstrated it was real when the establishment dismissed it. That took genuine intellectual courage. But the company they are building from that research is not contrarian — it is the consensus product that follows from a validated threat model.

The strongest bull case is timing, and I take it seriously. The MPIC mandate enforcement begins September 2025, creating an awareness wave among enterprises about infrastructure-level impersonation risks. If Crosslayer rides this wave aggressively — becomes the platform enterprises turn to when they realize their existing security stack does not monitor for the attacks MPIC was designed to prevent — there is a window to capture the market before CrowdStrike and Palo Alto bolt on cross-layer correlation as a feature. The team's relationships with certificate authorities could accelerate this. And if they expand their ambition beyond monitoring into becoming the trust layer for internet infrastructure — not just watching for attacks but actively securing the routing and certificate ecosystem — the consequence magnitude grows considerably. The internet's trust infrastructure underpins trillions of dollars in economic activity. If Crosslayer evolved from "we monitor your attack surface" to "we are the verification layer that makes BGP hijacking and certificate misissuance structurally impossible," that is a different company with a different consequence magnitude. But that is not what the dossier describes. What the dossier describes is a monitoring SaaS with four capabilities and a demo-driven sales process targeting healthcare, crypto, and banking verticals.

The team composition reinforces my concern. All three founders come from the same department at Princeton — deep technical alignment but no commercial DNA. No one on this team has sold enterprise software. No one has run a go-to-market function. The Chief Scientist is a tenured professor who may not be full-time. When I talk about gene pool engineering — identifying your top five risks and recruiting specifically to address them — the most obvious risk for an academic team commercializing research is the go-to-market risk, and there is no evidence anyone on this team addresses it. Y Combinator helps, but three PhD researchers from the same lab is not a team constructed to win enterprise deals against Censys with $131 million in funding and 130% ARR growth.

I respect this team enormously. The MPIC work is a genuine contribution to internet security, and the knowledge moat is real. But I invest my own money in companies where the consequence of success justifies the effort at a civilizational scale, and Crosslayer is building a better security dashboard for a subset of attack vectors in a $5 billion market. They have reduced their risk profile — proven technology, mandated standard, known threat model — to the point where the probable outcome is a solid security company. That is precisely the trade-off I warn about: reducing the probability of failure until the consequence of success becomes, for my purposes, insufficient.
