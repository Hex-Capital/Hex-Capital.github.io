# Aurorin CAD -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The AI-CAD category is rapidly becoming a Girardian nightmare. Zoo has raised $10 million. Adam AI has raised $4 million. Hestus graduated from YC two batches ago. PTC's Onshape launched an AI Advisor in October 2025. When I see four startups and multiple incumbents all converging on the same thesis -- "CAD needs AI" -- my default reaction is to walk away. Competition is forming in real time, and the mimetic dynamics are clear: each new entrant validates the category, attracts more entrants, and the resulting competition destroys the margins that would justify the investment. But before I dismiss Aurorin entirely, I need to ask the precise question: is Michael Baron actually playing the same game as these competitors, or has he identified a secret that they have collectively missed?

The secret, if there is one, lies in the kernel. Zoo wraps its own geometry engine with a text-to-CAD API. Adam generates 3D shapes from text prompts. Hestus bolts an AI copilot onto SolidWorks. Every one of these approaches accepts the premise that the existing CAD architecture -- the Parasolid and ACIS kernels built in the 1980s -- is a given, something to work around or on top of. Baron's contrarian claim is that the kernel itself is the disease, not just the symptom. You cannot make a 1980s geometry engine AI-native any more than you could make a horse AI-native. You have to rebuild the foundation. This is a genuinely non-consensus position. Most CAD industry experts would tell you that kernel replacement is a fool's errand -- the switching costs are too high, the file format lock-in too deep, the certification requirements too demanding, the engineering effort too vast for any startup. The competitors implicitly agree, which is why they all chose easier paths. If Baron is right that the kernel is the bottleneck, then his competitors are building elaborate structures on rotten foundations, and the incumbents are trapped by the very architecture that made them dominant. That structural trap -- where Dassault and PTC cannot rebuild their kernels without breaking backward compatibility with millions of existing designs -- is the kind of innovator's dilemma that creates openings for new monopolists.

The founder profile is the strongest signal in this dossier. Three SpaceX internships -- Raptor combustion simulation, Dragon GNC, Starshield flight software -- means Baron has worked inside arguably the most demanding hardware engineering environment on earth. He has seen firsthand how engineers struggle with CAD tools that take hours to open a file while designing rockets. Apple GPU driver optimization gives him the low-level hardware knowledge needed to build a kernel that actually exploits modern silicon. Most tellingly, he spent four years (2018-2022) building a multi-GPU graphics engine from scratch that rendered "the buildings and terrain of the world at hundreds of FPS on multiple monitors." That is not a weekend project or a hackathon demo. That is someone who has been training to build exactly this product for his entire technical career. Building a kernel from scratch rather than wrapping an existing one is the hardest possible path -- it is the opposite of lean startup methodology. This is definite optimism expressed in architecture: Baron has a specific vision of what a modern CAD kernel should be and is executing against it without waiting for customer validation of easier approaches.

The bull case is compelling enough that I need to articulate it fully. If the custom kernel works -- if it genuinely leverages GPU parallelism to achieve the claimed order-of-magnitude performance improvement -- then Aurorin has a proprietary technology moat that is measured in years of replication effort. No competitor is attempting a full kernel build. The incumbents are structurally unable to do so without cannibalizing their existing businesses. And the AI-native architecture means that as LLMs and generative models improve, Aurorin's kernel can absorb those improvements directly into the geometry engine rather than translating them through legacy API layers. This is the Stripe pattern: everyone else was building payment wrappers around existing processors, while the Collisons rebuilt the infrastructure. If Baron is the technical talent that his background suggests, and if he can recruit a small team of exceptional engineers through YC's network, the kernel becomes a compounding asset -- every feature built on it extends the moat. The market is $12 billion and growing, the incumbents are architecturally trapped, and the category is large enough for a power-law return.

But I have real concerns that prevent this from being an Invest. The solo-founder problem is not abstract here -- CAD kernel development has historically required teams of dozens working for years. Parasolid was a major engineering effort by a well-resourced team. Baron may be technically brilliant, but one person building a kernel, an AI agent, a desktop application, and managing a startup simultaneously is an execution risk that compounds with every feature. More fundamentally, I see no beachhead strategy. The YC launch page targets "hardware companies" generically. Where is the Harvard? Where is the specific, tiny market that Aurorin can completely monopolize before expanding? Baron's SpaceX background suggests an obvious wedge -- aerospace startups and small space companies who need fast prototyping and are less locked into legacy SolidWorks ecosystems -- but this isn't articulated. Targeting "hardware companies" broadly is competitive thinking, not monopoly thinking. And the performance claims -- seconds versus twenty minutes -- remain founder assertions without independent validation. Single-part creation speed may not translate to the complex assemblies of thousands of parts that professional engineers actually work with. The absence of any traction signal -- no revenue, no named customers, no LOIs, not even user counts -- makes it impossible to assess whether the kernel actually delivers on its promise in practice.

The category itself is where my Girardian concern persists. Yes, Baron's approach is differentiated from Zoo, Adam, and Hestus today. But the broader convergence of capital and attention on "AI-CAD" means that the space will attract more competitors, more incumbent responses, and more noise. If the kernel approach proves correct, well-funded teams will attempt their own kernel builds. The head start is real but not infinite. And the path to monopoly requires not just better technology but network effects or switching costs that compound over time -- design libraries, team collaboration features, integrations with simulation and manufacturing tools -- none of which are visible yet. Proprietary technology alone, without at least one additional monopoly characteristic, makes for a defensible position but not necessarily an unassailable one. I would want to see Baron articulate specifically how early kernel adoption creates compounding returns that make later competition structurally futile.

This is a company I would watch carefully but not invest in today. The technical insight is genuine and the founder's background is unusually well-matched to the problem. If Baron recruits two or three exceptional kernel engineers, demonstrates the performance claims on complex real-world assemblies, and identifies a specific beachhead market he can dominate completely, the evaluation changes materially. The secret about the kernel is real enough to be interesting but not yet proven enough to justify deploying capital against the execution risks.
