# Beyond Reach Labs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what immediately activates my framework about Beyond Reach Labs: AI is simultaneously the demand catalyst AND the moat reinforcer. SpaceX filing for a million-satellite orbital AI datacenter constellation, Starcloud proposing 88,000 datacenter satellites, Google launching Project Suncatcher — all of this projected demand for in-space power exists *because* AI needs more compute, and some fraction of that compute is heading to orbit. Meanwhile, AI cannot build, launch, deploy, or maintain a scissor-truss solar array that unfolds to the size of a football field in zero gravity. This is the exact inverse of the typical AI startup trap I warn about constantly. Most founders pitch me businesses where AI is the product; here, AI is the customer. The business would be a solid power-infrastructure play even without the AI wave — commercial space stations and lunar outposts need power regardless — but AI non-obviously creates a potential 500x demand multiplier. That's a textbook "cherry on top" configuration, except the cherry might be larger than the sundae.

The sane-person calibration on this founding team is about as precise as I've ever seen at pre-seed. Pele Collins didn't just work at SpaceX — he led the parachute production engineering for Crew Dragon Mk 3, the system that safely returned NASA astronauts from the ISS for the first time since Apollo. That's human-rated flight hardware at the highest stakes imaginable. Mitchell Fogelson's PhD at CMU is literally in the core technology: mechanical metamaterials for deployable space structures, funded by a NASA NIAC grant, validated in zero-gravity parabolic flight experiments. These two met thirteen years ago as UPenn freshmen studying mechanical engineering. The deep pre-existing relationship, the complementary operator-plus-inventor pairing, the specificity of domain expertise to the exact problem — this is what "sane" looks like. And the "insane" part? Two people from Pittsburgh with pre-seed capital proposing to out-engineer Redwire, a publicly traded company with $304 million in revenue and established flight heritage, on the fundamental architecture of how satellites get power. That gap between credibility and audacity is precisely the signal I hunt for.

The structural moat here makes my anti-SaaS heart sing. Patents on PETS and HERDS are the starting layer, but the real defensibility stack goes much deeper. Space hardware requires thermal vacuum testing, vibration qualification, radiation hardening, electromagnetic compatibility certification — a multi-year gauntlet that creates genuine barriers to entry once you've passed through it. Their Q2 2027 in-space demonstration, if successful, establishes flight heritage that no subsequent entrant can shortcut. And then there's the innovator's dilemma dynamic with Redwire: Redwire has invested heavily in ROSA roll-out blanket architecture and would need to cannibalize its own product line and retool manufacturing to compete on scissor-truss geometry. That's Clayton Christensen's playbook drawn perfectly — the incumbent is structurally inhibited from responding. Once a satellite manufacturer designs a spacecraft bus around Beyond Reach Labs' form factor, switching costs become enormous because you'd need to redesign attitude control, power distribution, and structural integration. None of this can be disrupted by cheaper software or better language models.

The primitive-versus-application test is where this gets interesting but not perfect. Space power is genuine infrastructure — orbital datacenters, commercial stations, lunar outposts physically cannot exist without it. If Beyond Reach Labs becomes the standard deployable array architecture, every ambitious space program's success improves when their technology succeeds. That's the definition of a primitive. But it's a hardware primitive, not a protocol primitive. There are no compounding network effects the way Solana or Helium create them. Each unit sold doesn't make the next unit more valuable. It's closer to what Seneca is doing with autonomous wildfire suppression — critical enabling infrastructure with physical-world moats — than what Aleo is doing with zero-knowledge proofs. I'm enthusiastic about infrastructure plays, but I score them differently than protocol plays because the compounding dynamics are fundamentally different.

The bear case I have to sit with is the timeline and capital intensity. This is a two-person team that needs to navigate years of qualification testing, build manufacturing capability, and convert non-binding LOIs into binding contracts — all before generating meaningful revenue. The $175M+ in LOIs sound impressive, but aerospace LOIs are the loosest form of demand signal in any industry. Programs get delayed by decades, restructured, cancelled. And the orbital datacenter thesis that creates the 500x demand multiplier? Not a single one of those constellations is operational. If SpaceX's million-satellite filing or Starcloud's 88,000-satellite proposal turns out to be five years late or never materializes, the near-term addressable market shrinks dramatically back to traditional satellite power plus a handful of commercial space stations. The company will need significant additional capital rounds just to reach production — this isn't a capital-efficient software business that can bootstrap to profitability. But here's why I still lean in: the technology was born from years of NASA-funded research, not a weekend hackathon. The founders' combined fifteen-plus years of relevant flight hardware and deployable structures experience means the execution risk, while real, is carried by people who have actually shipped things that went to space and brought humans home safely. And even in the conservative scenario — no orbital datacenters, just Axiom's commercial station and Artemis lunar infrastructure — there's enough demand to build a meaningful business.

The narrative can stretch. Today it's "deployable solar arrays for satellites." Tomorrow it's "power infrastructure for humanity's expansion into space." Each new space application — tourism, manufacturing, mining, settlement — expands the story without requiring narrative contortion. The infinity optionality is real, even if the near-term path runs through the unglamorous work of qualifying hardware and closing government contracts. This is the kind of bet where, if the orbital datacenter wave materializes on anything like the projected timeline, you're looking at a company that provided a foundational capability for an entirely new computing paradigm. And if it doesn't, you still own a stake in the company with the best deployable solar array architecture serving a market growing at 18% CAGR.

I'd write a check. The founder-idea specificity is exceptional, the moat is genuinely AI-resistant and deepens with every qualification milestone, and the market is being pulled forward by forces the founders didn't create but are perfectly positioned to serve. The capital intensity and timeline risk keep this from the top tier — this isn't Solana at $0.05 where the protocol dynamics create winner-take-all compounding. But it's a physically-grounded infrastructure play with credentialed operators and a structural positioning that incumbents cannot easily replicate. That's my kind of bet.
