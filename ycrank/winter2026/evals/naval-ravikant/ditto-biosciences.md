# Ditto Biosciences -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The specific knowledge here is the real thing. Not the kind you pick up in a graduate program or a stint at McKinsey -- the kind that takes a decade of obsessive curiosity about how organisms evolve to manipulate each other's immune systems. Adair Borges spent her PhD studying phage-bacteria warfare and CRISPR defense mechanisms -- literally how biological entities evolve weapons and counter-weapons. Dennis Sun did his PhD in computational and genomic biology with a thesis on axolotl brain regeneration. Emily Weiss studied microbial communities and sequencing technologies. All three worked together for three years at Arcadia Science, a startup specifically built around non-model organism biology -- which is the exact intellectual substrate of what Ditto does. This team didn't pivot into biotech because the market was hot. They've been swimming in host-parasite evolutionary dynamics for the better part of their careers. Borges has 50+ papers and a patent on anti-CRISPR proteins. That's not domain expertise. That's the kind of accumulated understanding that would take a well-funded competitor years to replicate even if they wanted to, because the knowledge lives in the intuitions you build from spending thousands of hours staring at how parasites co-evolve with their hosts. When I invested in Extropic, it was because the founders had spent their careers thinking about thermodynamic computing at a level of physical intuition no amount of funding could shortcut. Same pattern here -- different domain, same irreducibility of the knowledge.

The contrarian positioning is genuine. Over 98% of viral and parasite proteins remain uncharacterized. Mainstream drug discovery is fixated on synthetic antibody engineering, small molecule screening, and cell therapy. The idea that parasitic worms, ticks, and viruses have already solved the immunomodulation problem through millions of years of evolutionary pressure -- and that we should mine their genomes rather than design molecules from scratch -- is the kind of insight that makes most pharma executives uncomfortable. Smart people will raise the immunogenicity objection: parasite-derived proteins will trigger immune responses. The founders know this -- they're building a tissue biobank specifically to map immune memory to these proteins. That's not hand-waving; that's a scientific team acknowledging the hardest technical risk and building infrastructure to address it. The timing convergence matters: AlphaFold-era protein structure prediction makes systematic screening of millions of parasite proteins newly feasible. Five years ago this approach would have been prohibitively slow. Now it's computationally tractable. That's a genuine "why now" rooted in physics, not hype cycles.

Here's where my framework creates tension. Biotech drug development is the canonical unleveraged business. Each therapeutic candidate requires its own preclinical validation, its own IND-enabling studies, its own multi-phase clinical trials. You can't write code once and serve a million patients. The timeline is 10-15 years. The capital requirement is hundreds of millions. The failure rate is 90%. This is the opposite of "code and media as leverage" -- it's proportional human effort and capital for every unit of progress. My thesis says leverage is the dividing line between businesses that compound and businesses that grind. By that measure, drug development grinds. The competitors aren't messing around either -- Seismic, Anokion, and Sonoma have raised $200M+ each, and Pandion was acquired by Merck for $1.9B. Ditto has three scientists and YC funding against that capital stack.

But the bull case demands honest engagement. If the proprietary database of 1M+ analyzed parasite proteins and the tissue biobank become platform assets -- infrastructure that pharma companies license rather than replicate -- then the leverage equation shifts. This becomes a picks-and-shovels play, not a pipeline play. Stack Overflow didn't compete with developers; it built the knowledge layer underneath them. If Ditto becomes the definitive source for parasite-derived immunomodulatory candidates, that's a compounding data moat. Every new organism analyzed, every immunogenicity profile mapped, makes the platform more valuable and harder to replicate. The 1-2 nM binding affinities on early candidates suggest the screening methodology works. And the market validates the endpoint: Pandion's $1.9B acquisition proves pharma will pay generously for novel immunomodulatory protein platforms. The question is whether Ditto builds the database layer or tries to become a drug company. The former has leverage. The latter doesn't.

The team's integrity signal is embedded in their career choices. Three scientists who could have stayed in comfortable academic positions chose to leave and build together. The three-year collaboration at Arcadia wasn't a co-working-space acquaintance -- it was shared scientific work in the same intellectual domain. Dennis Sun's dual role as scientist and Chief of Staff at Arcadia suggests someone who understands both the science and the business machinery. No red flags in behavior or communication. The long-term orientation is implicit in choosing biotech -- nobody starts a drug discovery company for a quick exit.

I'd write a small check here. The specific knowledge is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed -- genuinely non-teachable, accumulated over decades, at exactly the right intersection. The contrarian angle is real, not manufactured. The technical compounding potential through the protein database and biobank is there. What holds me back from a larger position is the leverage architecture: unless this becomes a platform rather than a pipeline company, the business model requires proportional capital for proportional progress, and that's structurally at odds with how I think about compounding returns. This is a bet on the founders' specific knowledge being so deep that it creates its own category -- not unlike my Extropic bet, where the physics is speculative but the knowledge is irreplaceable.
