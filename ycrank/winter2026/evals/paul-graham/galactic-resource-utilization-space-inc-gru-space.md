# Galactic Resource Utilization Space, Inc. (GRU Space) -- Paul Graham Evaluation

This company requires at least four miracles to succeed: ISRU technology that has never been demonstrated on the lunar surface must work at operational scale, SpaceX Starship must achieve reliable and affordable lunar delivery on roughly the proposed timeline, a regulatory framework for commercial habitation on the Moon must be invented from scratch, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals must commit $10 million each for a five-night stay in a habitat that won't exist for six-plus years. I have a specific red flag for companies that need more than one miracle. Each additional miracle multiplies the risk rather than adding to it. Boom Supersonic, where I wrote my largest personal check, needed one core miracle — regulatory certification of a new supersonic airframe — on top of proven physics (Concorde flew for 27 years) and demonstrated market demand (airlines were already expressing interest). GRU Space is operating in a fundamentally different probability regime.

The origin of this idea concerns me. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer for Skyler Chan appears to be ambition and fascination with space, not organic discovery born from lived experience. Chan is 22, graduated early from Berkeley EECS, worked at Tesla, built a NASA-funded 3D printer, earned a pilot's license at 16 — all genuinely impressive for someone that age. But "build the first hotel on the Moon" is a vision statement, not a problem someone stumbled into while trying to do something else. Drew Houston kept forgetting his USB drive. The Collisons kept wrestling with payment APIs. The Airbnb founders couldn't make rent. The strongest startup ideas grow like weeds from specific frustrations. I don't see the specific frustration here. I see a smart, driven young person who picked the most ambitious thing they could imagine. That produces a different kind of company than one rooted in organic need.

Where the picture gets more interesting is Dr. Kevin Cannon. If there is organic problem discovery anywhere in this company, it lives in him. He founded the Exolith Lab at UCF, created the Planetary Simulant Database, received $2 million from NASA for aluminum extraction from lunar regolith, and has spent his entire career on exactly the technical problem at the core of GRU Space — converting lunar dirt into useful materials. He is arguably the foremost living expert on regolith processing. That is not the kind of knowledge you can hire. It is not the kind of expertise a competitor can replicate by raising more money. The fact that Chan recruited Cannon away from both academia and his previous role as CTO of Ethos Space is itself a meaningful signal — it suggests Chan can attract world-class talent, and it suggests Cannon believes GRU's approach to the lunar surface is more promising than his previous vehicle. But Cannon is listed as "Founding Member of Technical Staff," not co-founder, and the co-founder relationship question — did these two know each other before deciding to start this company together? — is unanswered in the dossier.

The schlep here is real and enormous. Radiation shielding, micrometeorite protection, vacuum-sealed habitation, thermal management in a 300-degree temperature swing, regulatory approval for human-rated commercial structures on an extraterrestrial body — this is the kind of complexity that makes smart people look away unconsciously. That part of my framework is satisfied. But there is an important distinction between schlep blindness and rational avoidance. Schlep blindness applies when the problem is solvable but painful — when the barrier is willingness, not feasibility. Stripe required navigating banks and compliance, which was tedious but possible. The question with GRU Space is whether lunar surface construction is currently in the category of "painful but tractable" or "not yet physically achievable." That distinction matters enormously. If the schlep is so large that it cannot be overcome with determination and resourcefulness — if it requires technological breakthroughs that haven't happened yet — then willingness to tackle it is courage, not competitive advantage.

The strongest bull case is this: if any version of commercial lunar activity becomes real in the 2030s, the team with the world's leading regolith scientist and a working relationship with NASA's CLPS program has a genuine first-mover position. The phased mission architecture — 10 kg demo in 2029, larger deployment in 2031, full hotel in 2032 — shows thoughtful de-risking rather than a single bet-the-company moment. The press coverage (15+ outlets in January 2026) and YC acceptance demonstrate that the vision resonates with gatekeepers. And if I'm honest, the ambition magnitude is the kind that triggers my Boom exception — when something is important enough for humanity, I have historically overridden my standard priors. But Boom had proven aerodynamics and an existing regulatory pathway. This company is attempting to pioneer construction technology on an alien surface while simultaneously creating a hospitality business and navigating a regulatory vacuum. The ambition is there. The number of simultaneous unknowns is what stops me.

On the demand side, I see almost nothing. A reservation page accepting $250K-$1M deposits launched in January 2026, but there is no public data on whether anyone has actually deposited. Media coverage is interest, not demand. The $1,000 application fee is clever — low enough to attract aspirational interest, structured as non-refundable — but without data on applications received, it tells me the mechanism exists, not that the market exists. At pre-seed I don't penalize thin demand evidence heavily, but for a company whose entire business model depends on ultra-HNW individuals committing $10 million each for an experience that won't exist for six or more years, some early deposit data would have materially changed my assessment.

I am passing on this one. The technical talent is exceptional — Cannon alone would justify a closer look in almost any other context. Chan's early achievements are remarkable for 22. But this is not an angel-scale bet. The capital requirements for three lunar missions will be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars. The company cannot become ramen profitable or default alive in any meaningful sense. It requires sustained venture and government funding across a six-plus year pre-revenue period. Even if I believed in every element of the vision, the right instrument for this kind of bet is a much larger check at a later stage, after the 2029 demo mission validates the core ISRU technology. With my own money at pre-seed, I need a path where determination and resourcefulness can overcome obstacles. Here, the obstacles are governed by orbital mechanics and materials science, not by founder grit.
