# DAIVIN! -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about DAIVIN! is the multiple-miracles problem. Portable electrolysis has to generate sufficient oxygen flow for human respiration at depth -- that's an unproven capability at this scale. Then hydrogen gas, which is explosive, has to be safely managed underwater next to a breathing diver. Then a novel regulatory certification pathway has to be navigated for a life-critical device with no existing framework. Then defense procurement has to be cracked by a solo founder. Each of these is a low-probability event on its own. Multiply them together and you're in territory I explicitly avoid. When I backed Airbnb, the single miracle was marketplace liquidity. When I backed Harvey, the single miracle was model fidelity -- and that miracle was being delivered by external foundation model labs, not Harvey itself. DAIVIN!'s plan requires the founder to personally deliver at least three independent technical breakthroughs while simultaneously building a business. That's not a startup with one miracle. That's a research program with a business plan attached.

The structural moment test is where this falls apart for me. I ask every company: what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now? The dossier's "why now" is entirely inferred -- the founder hasn't articulated a structural inflection. Battery density has been improving steadily for a decade. PEM electrolyzer costs have been declining gradually with the hydrogen economy. Helium prices have risen 400-1,000% -- since 2000, which is a 25-year trend, not a recent threshold crossing. None of these represent the kind of acute inflection I look for. Compare this to Harvey, where I could point to the GPT-3 to GPT-4 capability jump and predict within 12-18 months when model fidelity would cross the legal-grade threshold. There's no equivalent capability curve here that's about to cross a critical threshold. The physics of electrolysis haven't changed. What's changed is incremental, not structural.

The market sizing concerns me independently of the timing question. The scuba diving equipment market is $1-2 billion globally. The broader SCBA market is $5.2 billion. Even the fuel cells in aerospace and defense market is only $655 million. These are not the market sizes that produce generational returns. For this to work at venture scale, the TAM would need to be 10x larger than it appears -- and the mechanism for that expansion ("Sea, Land & Space") requires entering entirely separate markets (firefighting, space applications, military operations), each with its own regulatory regime, distribution channel, and technical requirements. That's not market expansion; that's starting three additional companies sequentially. When I invested in PagerDuty, "operations alerting" looked small but every company running software needed it -- the hidden scale was in the universal applicability of the same product to the same buyer. DAIVIN!'s expansion requires fundamentally different products for fundamentally different buyers in fundamentally different regulatory environments.

The strongest bull case deserves genuine engagement. If portable electrolysis actually works at the claimed specifications -- 200-meter depth, sufficient oxygen generation, safe hydrogen management -- this would be paradigm-shifting technology in a category that hasn't changed in a century. The regulatory barrier that makes entry difficult also creates a structural moat for a first mover. Leo Kankkunen's credentials are real: youngest high-voltage electrical certification in Finland, seven years of industry experience, military veteran, certified diver. The founder-market fit on the electrical engineering dimension is legitimate. And I'm someone who invests in regulated markets others avoid -- Color Health required CLIA lab certification, Anduril required ITAR compliance and security clearances. If the core physics work, and if this founder has genuinely "invented and tested the first-ever tankless dive gear," the first-mover advantage in a new technology category with massive certification barriers would be substantial. The Anduril analogy is tempting: defense hardware that seemed impossible but created a structural vacuum no one else could fill.

But the Anduril comparison breaks down on inspection. When I led Anduril's Series D, they had a functioning product deployed with military customers, a credible team including Palmer Luckey, and a clear structural vacancy created by Google's Project Maven exit. DAIVIN! has a solo founder, no evidence of independent testing or third-party validation of the core technology claims, no filed patents found publicly, no customers, and no demonstrated regulatory pathway. The distance between "I have an electrolysis vest concept" and "I have a certified life-support system that keeps people alive at 200 meters" is measured in years and tens of millions of dollars of hardware iteration. This is a "software-aware" hardware business at best -- the core competitive advantage is electrochemistry and mechanical engineering, not software. A smart toaster analogy doesn't quite fit, but the underlying concern applies: removing the software layer, this is fundamentally an electrochemistry company, and electrochemistry companies don't compound the way software platforms do.

I'd need to see three things to reconsider: a working prototype tested at meaningful depth with independent validation, a patent portfolio protecting the specific integration architecture, and at least one co-founder with deep electrochemistry or life-support systems expertise. A solo founder building complex multi-disciplinary hardware with unvalidated core physics claims and no articulated regulatory strategy is too many unknowns stacked on top of each other. This is a pass.
