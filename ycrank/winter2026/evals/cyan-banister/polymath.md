# Polymath -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Polymath is something that would make most investors excited and makes me deeply cautious: this is one of the most crowded, best-capitalized, highest-consensus categories in all of tech right now. Anthropic is publicly talking about spending a billion dollars on RL environments. There are 35-plus companies building in this space. Applied Compute raised $100 million. Mechanize has Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Patrick Collison writing checks. Scale AI — a $29 billion incumbent — is actively expanding into RL environments through their SEAL lab. And frontier labs are deliberately cultivating a diverse vendor ecosystem specifically to commoditize this category and drive prices down. When I invested in SpaceX, people thought private space was insane. When I backed Uber, ride-sharing was illegal in most cities. The signal I've learned to trust over and over is that the most promising companies are not popular and they are difficult to assess. Polymath is in a category that is extremely popular and very easy to assess — everyone can see this opportunity, and everyone is already here.

If I were sitting across from Dylan and Naren, my first question would be: tell me your story. Not the benchmark, not the environment factory architecture — how did you get here? And this is where the dossier goes quiet on me. I see two UC Berkeley grads with solid technical credentials — Hume AI and AWS for Dylan, Amazon's optimization team and Plaid for Naren. Those are real engineering backgrounds. Naren co-founded Omni Technologies at Berkeley SkyDeck building assistive tech for people with disabilities, which tells me something about his values and his willingness to build from scratch. But I can't find the biographical thread that connects either founder to the specific problem of RL environment generation. When I backed the Crusoe team, their story about turning waste gas into computation was grounded in an insight they'd arrived at independently — it was personal, it was weird, and nobody else saw it. Here, I see technically capable people who identified a market that every AI investor in the world is already staring at. That doesn't mean they're wrong, but it does mean they're solving a problem that looks like an opportunity rather than a calling.

The bull case is real and I want to be honest about it. I have backed infrastructure at inflection points before — SpaceX, Crusoe, Anduril. If Polymath's automated environment factory genuinely produces environments at ten times the efficiency of the manual approaches competitors like Mechanize are using (paying engineers $500K each to hand-build environments), that's a meaningful technical moat. The Horizon-SWE benchmark is a smart credibility play — if frontier labs start reporting results against it, Polymath could become a standard-setter in the way that shapes procurement decisions. And the founding team's combined AI research plus systems engineering background maps directly onto what this product requires. If they can execute on the automation promise and lock in even two or three frontier lab contracts before the market consolidates, this could be a real business. What would have to be true for this to be a great investment is that their factory approach creates a compounding advantage — each environment makes the next one cheaper and better — and that this advantage holds up against Scale AI's distribution power and Prime Intellect's open-source alternative. That's a narrow path, but not impossible.

But here's what I keep coming back to: the structural dynamics of this market work against the kind of company I like to back. The buyer pool is maybe five to seven frontier labs. Losing one customer is catastrophic. Those buyers are deliberately commoditizing the vendor ecosystem. And the $20,000-per-environment pricing model that the market currently supports is going to face brutal compression as open-source alternatives emerge and incumbents pour resources in. This isn't a space where being scrappy and weird gives you an edge — it's a space where the biggest war chest and the deepest existing relationships win. I don't see a world where Polymath's automated approach creates a moat that Scale AI can't replicate with its fourteen-billion-dollar Meta investment and existing relationships with every frontier lab on earth. And the company creates no economic access for underserved populations, makes no invisible system visible, operates in no stigmatized or regulated category that others fear to enter. It simply doesn't activate the parts of my framework that have led to my best investments.

Two technically strong Berkeley founders building in the hottest consensus category in AI, competing against thirty-five-plus companies including multiple that are orders of magnitude better funded — this is exactly the kind of bet where the founders might be talented, the technology might work, and the outcome still doesn't justify the risk because the market structure is designed to commoditize them. I wish I could hear their personal stories directly, because there might be something there the dossier doesn't capture. But based on what I can see, this is a pass for me.
