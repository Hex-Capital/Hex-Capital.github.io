# Sonarly -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Sonarly is the platonic ideal of what I pass on. An AI-powered layer sitting on top of Sentry and Datadog that triages production alerts and generates fix PRs — this is not an insane idea. This is the most obvious idea in developer tooling right now. PagerDuty already ships an SRE Agent. Incident.io already automates 80% of incident response. BigPanda has been doing AI alert correlation for years with $340 million in funding. When a Hacker News commenter can replicate your core workflow with GitHub Actions and Claude and get 30% mergeable PRs on their first attempt, you are not building a business — you are building a feature that the monitoring platforms themselves will ship as a checkbox within a product cycle or two.

The founder-idea calibration here inverts my framework in both directions. The "sane" side requires deep domain credibility specific to the problem. These founders are CY Tech dropouts whose prior experience is Meoria — a consumer career guidance app for French high school students navigating Parcoursup. A hundred thousand users on a free consumer app is real hustle, and I respect founders who move to San Francisco and go through YC. But selling AI-powered developer infrastructure to engineering teams running microservices architectures is a fundamentally different game from guiding teenagers through college admissions. There's no evidence of deep observability engineering experience, SRE backgrounds, or enterprise sales capability. On the "insane" side, the idea needs to provoke genuine skepticism — and "let's use AI to reduce alert noise" provokes no skepticism at all. It's the first thing every engineering manager thinks when they see what LLMs can do. When your idea is simultaneously obvious to every incumbent AND every YC applicant, the non-consensus premium has evaporated.

My central analytical question — does this business get stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper? — produces a devastating answer. Sonarly doesn't just fail the "cherry on top" test; it's the inverse of the test. Remove AI and there is literally no product. The entire value proposition IS the LLM doing triage and generating fixes. That means every improvement in foundation model capabilities benefits Sonarly's competitors exactly as much as it benefits Sonarly. When Datadog or Sentry integrate Claude or GPT natively — and both have active AI initiatives — Sonarly's integration layer becomes redundant because the monitoring platform already has the context, the data, and the customer relationship. The "internal map of the production system" that the founders cite as differentiation is conceptually interesting, but it's a data asset that Datadog already possesses natively. You're trying to reconstruct from API calls what the monitoring platform already knows from first principles.

The bull case would require me to believe something specific: that alert triage is actually a new category, not a feature — that the workflow between "monitoring tool fires alert" and "engineer opens IDE to fix the bug" represents a durable layer of the stack where a standalone company can own the customer relationship. If Sonarly's system map and deduplication logic compound with each customer's usage into genuine switching costs, and if auto-fix accuracy crosses a threshold where teams trust it (well above the 30% reported by that HN commenter), and if the Atlassian OpsGenie sunset creates a genuine migration moment — then maybe there's a wedge. But that's three simultaneous breakthroughs required against entrenched competitors with massive distribution advantages. The Birchbox lesson haunts me here: narrative magnitude without structural moat produces the worst venture outcome. Sonarly's narrative can stretch to "autonomous production engineering," which sounds enormous, but the path from middleware layer to category-defining company runs directly through incumbents who will absorb the functionality.

At the protocol-versus-application level, Sonarly is purely application-layer — building on Sentry's APIs, Datadog's APIs, Slack's APIs, and a third-party LLM. There is no new primitive being created. Alert triage middleware doesn't become infrastructure that other companies build on. Compare this to Venmo, which created a new peer-to-peer payment primitive, or Helium, which created a decentralized wireless protocol. Sonarly creates a workflow automation. That's a feature, not a foundation. The ceiling is inherently capped, and the floor is nonexistent — no revenue, no paid tiers, no demonstrated willingness to pay from customers. I'm not penalizing them for being pre-seed, but when everything else in the thesis is structurally broken, the absence of any economic cushion leaves nothing to work with.
