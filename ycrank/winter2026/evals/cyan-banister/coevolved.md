# Coevolved -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I'd want to know about Coevolved -- the thing that jumps out before anything else -- is the pivot. In January 2026, they archived an open-source multi-agent orchestration framework and turned it into a mortgage origination product. That sequence tells me a story, and it's not the story I look for. It tells me two talented engineers built a general-purpose tool, then went looking for a market to point it at. Mortgage was the answer they landed on. But when I meet founders, my first question is always "tell me your story -- not the business." And the story I'm hearing here is about technical capability searching for a problem, not about a problem that found the right person to solve it. Athan Zhang's biographical thread runs through elite academic achievement -- Thomas Jefferson magnet school, Princeton accelerated CS, NLP research under Danqi Chen, a quant internship at Five Rings, and a prior medtech startup that raised $1.2M for eye-scan dementia detection. Alex Li's thread runs through distributed computing and voice AI. Both are clearly gifted. But neither thread touches mortgage lending, housing access, financial services, or the lived experience of watching someone you love get crushed by a predatory or incomprehensible origination process. That biographical disconnection from the problem is the thing I can't get past.

Now, the bull case deserves honest engagement, because there IS a real economic access story buried in this idea. Mortgage origination costs exceed $10,000 per loan. The process is opaque, slow, and punishing -- especially for first-time homebuyers who don't have a broker in their network or parents who've been through it before. If you genuinely cut document chasing by 75% and make the borrower experience less bewildering, you're making one of the most important financial transactions in a person's life more accessible. Homeownership is the primary wealth-building mechanism for working families in this country. That resonates with me deeply -- it's the same pattern I saw in Affirm making credit transparent, or Carta making equity comprehensible. The mortgage system is exactly the kind of invisible, opaque power structure I'm drawn to making visible. If these founders had come to this problem because they'd watched their parents struggle to buy a first home, or because they'd spent two years inside a mortgage company and seen the dysfunction firsthand, I'd feel very differently about this company. The "why now" is also real -- LLM capabilities for document understanding have genuinely crossed a threshold, and lenders are under genuine cost pressure. Someone is going to build this.

But the question is whether these are the founders who build the defining company in mortgage AI, and the evidence doesn't give me conviction. Mortgage lending is one of the most heavily regulated spaces in financial services -- ECOA, Fair Housing Act, TRID disclosures, CFPB oversight, state-by-state licensing. When I backed companies in regulated, stigmatized sectors -- Contraline navigating FDA pathways, Anduril navigating defense procurement -- the founders had deep domain immersion that gave them an almost unfair understanding of the regulatory landscape. Here, neither founder has documented experience in financial services at all, let alone mortgage-specific compliance. That's not a fatal flaw at pre-seed -- people learn -- but it means the regulatory complexity that could be a moat for the right team becomes an execution risk for this team. And they're entering a market with Blend ($685M raised), Tavant (powering one in three U.S. mortgage loans), and Ocrolus ($80M raised for document processing specifically). These aren't hypothetical competitors. They have existing lender relationships, LOS integrations, and the data and capital to add AI capabilities.

There's also nothing here that feels non-obvious or unpopular -- and that matters to me. "AI agents for document-heavy workflows in financial services" is about as consensus as it gets in early 2026. Every investor I know is pattern-matching on this. The most promising companies in my experience are the ones that look strange and uncomfortable to most investors, the ones where people squint and say "that's insane." Nobody is squinting at AI for mortgage origination and calling it insane -- they're calling it obvious. The weirdness has already been arbitraged away by the sheer volume of AI-for-X companies entering every vertical simultaneously.

Finally, the co-founder relationship is a blank page. Different universities, no shared work history, no documented prior relationship. After HQ Trivia taught me that even the right product at the right time gets destroyed by unresolved founder dynamics, I always want to understand how co-founders found each other and how they fight. I can't evaluate what I can't see. That's not a red flag -- it's an absence of signal in a dimension where I need signal to feel comfortable writing a check.
