# Polymath -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company whose customers are explicitly conspiring to ensure it never becomes important. The SemiAnalysis newsletter lays it out plainly: frontier AI labs are *deliberately* cultivating a fragmented vendor ecosystem of 35+ RL environment companies to commoditize supply and drive prices down. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind -- these are the most sophisticated buyers on the planet, and their procurement strategy is designed to prevent any single vendor from gaining leverage. I have seen this dynamic before. When your customer's stated objective is to make your product interchangeable with 34 other suppliers, you are not building a category-defining company. You are competing for purchase orders. That is a fundamentally different game than the one I play.

Let me start where I always start: if Polymath succeeds completely, what changes? AI labs get better, cheaper RL training environments. Their agents improve faster. That matters -- but the transformation happens at the *agent* layer, not at the *environment-building* layer. Polymath is a supplier to the revolution, not the revolution itself. When I backed Square, success meant replacing the entire point-of-sale infrastructure of American commerce. When I backed Commonwealth Fusion, success meant replacing fossil fuel energy generation. When Polymath succeeds, the world gets... a more efficient vendor for a handful of AI labs. The consequence of success is a healthy B2B infrastructure business serving maybe ten customers. That is not the kind of outcome that justifies my attention or my capital.

The bull case deserves honest engagement, and here it is: if automated environment factories represent a genuine order-of-magnitude improvement over manual environment construction, and if environment quality becomes *the* binding constraint on AI agent capability -- not compute, not algorithms, but environments -- then Polymath is sitting on a critical chokepoint in the most important technology buildout of the decade. Anthropic alone discussed spending over a billion dollars on RL environments. The total market could scale dramatically. Their Horizon-SWE benchmark, which already has evaluation results from five frontier models, could become a standard-setting instrument that compounds their credibility. The timing is real: RLVR emerged as a new training paradigm only in 2025, and the demand curve is clearly exponential. Models scoring below 25% on Horizon-SWE signals a vast performance gap that better environments could close. If I squint, there is a version of this story where Polymath's automation approach creates a compounding advantage that manual competitors cannot match, and the company becomes indispensable infrastructure. But "if I squint" is not how I write checks.

The founders are competent engineers -- Berkeley EECS, relevant stints at Hume AI, AWS, Amazon, Plaid. But competent engineers building in a consensus area is precisely the profile I avoid. Thirty-five companies are building RL environments. Applied Compute raised $100 million. Mechanize has Nat Friedman and Patrick Collison backing it. Scale AI -- a $29 billion incumbent -- is entering the market directly. Everyone agrees this market is real. That is the opposite of the signal I look for. When I invested in Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry treated plant-based meat as a joke. Those dismissals were the signal. Here, nobody is dismissing the RL environments market -- they are fighting over it. There is no contrarian insight, no expert rejection, no outsider audacity. These are insiders executing the consensus playbook in a crowded market where their customers hold all the leverage.

The technology differentiation -- automated factories versus hand-built environments -- is real but insufficient. Automation is a feature, not a moat. The dossier itself notes that "no structural barrier identified would prevent well-resourced incumbents from building competing environment factories." Scale AI has existing relationships with every frontier lab and $14 billion in capital. The structural challenge of pivoting from static data annotation to interactive environments is real, but Scale AI has the engineering talent and customer trust to close that gap in months, not years. And Prime Intellect is open-sourcing environments entirely, which could undercut paid offerings at the foundation. When your competitive advantage is automation and a well-funded competitor can replicate the automation while an open-source project gives it away for free, your defensibility is a function of execution speed, not structural position. Execution races in hot markets are not where I make money.

The timing dimension is the strongest element here -- they are genuinely early on the RLVR curve, and the demand acceleration is real. But good timing in a consensus market is table stakes, not alpha. Every one of those 35 competitors is also timing this correctly. Being early matters only when you are early to something others have *not yet seen*. Everyone has seen RL environments. The rate of change in the underlying market is strong, but Polymath is not positioned ahead of a curve that others have missed -- they are positioned alongside thirty-four other companies on the same curve.
