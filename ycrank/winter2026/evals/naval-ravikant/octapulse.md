# OctaPulse -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I look at is what the founders know that can't be taught. Paul Grech is a CMU Tepper MBA who previously managed UX projects at Bloomberg. Rohan Singh is a CMU robotics student who worked at ASML, Toyota, Tesla, and NVIDIA. These are impressive credentials for building a computer vision system. They are not credentials for understanding fish. Neither founder has documented aquaculture experience -- no time on farms, no fisheries research, no hatchery operations work. Grech's stated motivation is "ocean conservation interest." That's a cause, not specific knowledge. Any smart CMU duo could have read the same industry reports, identified the same $200K-per-farm manual inspection cost, and built the same pitch. When I backed Evan Williams at Twitter, he'd spent years on Blogger absorbing how humans want to communicate publicly. That non-transferable understanding was the investment. Here, the founders' robotics and CV knowledge is genuine and portable -- but it's the kind of technical capability that a dozen other CMU and Stanford teams also possess. The domain knowledge that would make this team uniquely qualified -- understanding fish morphology across species, the tacit judgment hatchery technicians develop over years, the biological edge cases that break naive computer vision models -- that knowledge is absent from the founding team.

The competitive landscape reinforces the concern. Aquaticode in Norway already has $6M in funding and a database of 3M+ labeled fish images. They can scan 10,000 fish per hour. They've appointed industry veteran Trond Williksen as strategic advisor -- the kind of domain credibility OctaPulse lacks. Meanwhile, Tidal spun out of Google X with 30 billion data points across 50 million fish and the full weight of Alphabet's infrastructure behind it. OctaPulse's defense is "we focus on hatcheries, not grow-out pens." That's a positioning choice, not a moat. If hatchery QA proves to be a valuable market, Tidal can move upstream with more data, more capital, and existing farm relationships. Aquaticode is already expanding into new species and geographies. The dossier itself concedes that "a well-funded competitor with farm access could build a comparable dataset over 12-24 months." When the memo acknowledges the moat is fragile, I listen.

The leverage architecture here is linear, not exponential. This is automation, not the creation of a new form of leverage. A fish inspection tool that reduces per-fish processing from 5 minutes to 30 seconds is valuable to the farm operator -- genuinely useful technology. But it doesn't create a new category of capability. It doesn't enable a new type of person to do a new type of work the way Uber turned every car owner into an entrepreneur or Replit turned every curious person into a programmer. Each new farm deployment requires on-site integration, species-specific model tuning, and enterprise sales cycles. Revenue scales with deployment count, which scales with sales headcount. The data flywheel -- where each deployment's labeled images improve cross-species generalization -- is the closest thing to compounding leverage here, but it's nascent with one trout customer and two planned deployments. That's a hypothesis about compounding, not evidence of it.

The strongest bull case: aquaculture is a $327B industry that has genuinely surpassed wild-catch fishing, and it's dramatically underserved by software. The hatchery-first positioning is upstream in the value chain, where errors compound downstream into wasted feed and labor -- catching defects early is high-value work. The 6-figure paid pilot with Riverence, the largest U.S. trout producer, at the pre-seed stage is a real commercial signal. If OctaPulse can rapidly land 5-10 U.S. farms before Aquaticode crosses the Atlantic, they could build a defensible geographic beachhead with enough species diversity to make cross-species generalization real. The off-the-shelf camera approach lowers deployment friction compared to competitors building proprietary hardware. And the aquaculture industry's fragmentation across geographies and species means no single competitor will own every niche simultaneously. For this to work as a big outcome, though, you'd need the founders to develop deep domain knowledge quickly through customer immersion, the multi-species data moat to actually compound faster than competitors can replicate, and the U.S. market entry to provide enough runway before well-funded European and Alphabet-backed competitors expand. That's a lot of things that have to go right simultaneously -- and the founders' lack of domain-specific insight means they'll be learning what their competitors already know.

I keep coming back to the framework: specific knowledge that can't be taught, plus leverage that creates nonlinear output. OctaPulse has neither. The founders have teachable technical skills applied to an industry they entered through interest rather than obsession. The product automates an existing workflow rather than creating a new category of human capability. The timing isn't contrarian -- everyone agrees AI will automate manual inspection processes across industries. And the technology doesn't compound in a way that makes it structurally harder to compete with over time -- it's standard computer vision with domain-specific training data that established competitors already possess in greater quantities. This is a competent team building a useful product in a real market. It's not the kind of bet where I see asymmetric upside.
