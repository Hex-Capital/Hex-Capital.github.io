# CatchBack Cards -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

CatchBack tags itself Crypto/Web3 and NFT, which means it shows up in the filter I care most about -- and immediately fails the test I apply to that filter. My crypto portfolio is uniformly protocol-layer: Solana, Aleo, Algorand, Lightning Labs, Helium. Every one of those companies IS the primitive. CatchBack uses Nexus L1 as plumbing for verifiable randomness on a consumer mystery-pack app. That's application-layer crypto bolted onto a consumer entertainment product. It's the equivalent of saying "we use AWS" and calling yourself a cloud company. The open-sourcing of the randomness verification code is actually the tell here -- if the cryptographic proof is your differentiator and you give it away, you've explicitly volunteered that the protocol isn't your moat. You're a consumer app with a trust feature. Fine. But don't put Crypto/Web3 on the tin and expect me to evaluate you like Aleo.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't hit my filter either. Joseph Zhang is clearly credentialed -- Stanford CS, McKinsey, AWS, Nexus, Gates Scholar, ISEF Finalist. That's the "sane" half. But the idea isn't insane in the way I use that word. Mystery packs for trading cards? DOPA already does this at 100,000 daily users in Japan and just launched in the US. Whatnot proved you can build an $11.5 billion company in trading card commerce. TCGplayer sold to eBay for $295 million. The category has been validated so thoroughly that calling it non-consensus would be dishonest. Adding customizable odds and crypto verification to mystery packs is an iteration, not a paradigm break. When the market is this hot and the incumbents are this well-capitalized, you're not finding a contrarian opportunity -- you're finding a consensus one where the returns have already been priced in by Whatnot's Series F. My red flag fires hard here: hot market, TAM-led pitch, multiple well-funded competitors.

The Birchbox parallel nags at me. CatchBack has a compelling initial bundle -- custom pack creation plus cryptographic verification plus guaranteed buyback plus physical fulfillment. Individually, none of these are novel. DOPA does mystery packs at scale. Any marketplace can add verification. Buyback is just market-making with inventory risk. Physical fulfillment is logistics. The bundle is operationally cumbersome to replicate, which gives it some durability, but cumbersome isn't the same as defensible. Birchbox's initial bundle -- curated beauty samples, data on preferences, discovery mechanics -- was similarly cumbersome to replicate at first. Then dozens of competitors replicated it anyway. The lesson I carry from that investment: if each component of your moat can be unbundled and reimplemented by a well-funded competitor, the bundle isn't actually a moat. It's a head start you're renting, not owning. The guaranteed buyback mechanism is particularly fragile -- it creates inventory liability that scales with success, and any Pokémon card market correction turns that buyback promise into a balance-sheet bomb.

The strongest bull case would require CatchBack to transcend trading cards entirely and establish cryptographic randomness verification as a new commerce primitive -- a trust layer for any product category where randomized offerings exist. Sneaker drops, fashion mystery boxes, digital collectibles broadly. If "provably fair randomization" becomes a standard and CatchBack owns it, you've got a protocol-layer argument. The $13K MRR at pre-seed with 700 users is legitimately impressive engagement -- roughly $18/user/month suggests collectors are spending real money, not just poking around. The Steph Curry collaboration could provide genuine distribution. And the physical-world operations (card inventory, fulfillment, buyback pricing) do create operational complexity that pure-software competitors won't bother replicating. For this bull case to work, though, Zhang would need to articulate a vision where CatchBack becomes infrastructure for others, not just a consumer app -- and nothing in the current positioning suggests that trajectory. They open-sourced the verification code, which means anyone can build the trust layer without going through CatchBack. They gave away the protocol and kept the application. That's backwards from what I'd want to see.

One more thing I can't get past: half the founding team is invisible. Sophia Kim has zero public footprint -- no LinkedIn, no background, no documented role. My investments work when founding teams have deep pre-existing relationships and complementary, visible skills. When one co-founder is entirely undocumented, I can't evaluate team resilience, complementarity, or the relational depth that matters when things get genuinely hard. This isn't dispositive at pre-seed, but combined with everything else, it reinforces rather than counterbalances my concerns.
