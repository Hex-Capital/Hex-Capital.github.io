# Overshoot -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Overshoot: two cousins with exactly the right résumés -- Uber surge pricing systems, Meta AI GPU kernels, a computer vision startup acquired by Intel -- building exactly the product their experience prepared them for. A faster video inference API. And that's the problem. These founders have reduced their probability of failure by staying squarely within their domain expertise, building infrastructure that is a natural extension of everything they've already done. The result is a company that will probably work. But if it works, then what? They become another inference API in a market where Fireworks AI has $331 million and Together AI has $534 million. The consequence of success is a developer tool business that makes video AI applications marginally easier to build. Nobody's industry gets disrupted. No physical system gets replaced. The world operates exactly the same way, just with slightly faster video processing. I have a visceral reaction to founders this talented aiming this small.

The technology claim is sub-200ms video inference latency, which is genuinely useful but not structurally disruptive. They're serving open-source models -- Qwen3-VL, InternVL -- that they didn't build and don't control. Alibaba and Shanghai AI Lab set the roadmap. The SDK is "3 lines of code," which is great marketing but also tells you the integration layer is thin. The moat they describe is "focus" -- specializing in video while general-purpose platforms optimize for breadth. I've seen this movie before. Focus is a strategy for early traction, not a durable barrier. When real-time video inference becomes a meaningful revenue category -- and it will -- Fireworks and Together will add those codec and streaming optimizations. They have the engineering teams, the GPU fleet, and the customer relationships to do it in a quarter. And behind them, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure can offer video inference at marginal cost to their existing customers. Overshoot sits in the most dangerous position in any technology stack: between models they don't own and platforms that can absorb their differentiation.

The strongest bull case goes something like this: every robot, every autonomous vehicle, every security system, every AR headset will need real-time video understanding, and Overshoot becomes the Stripe of physical AI -- the default API layer that developers reach for first. The VLM capability curve is exponential and crossing production thresholds right now, January 2025 is genuinely early, and the founders' combined experience in low-latency systems and computer vision platforms is precisely matched to the technical challenge. If video agents become as ubiquitous as chatbots, the company sitting at that inference layer captures enormous value. And specialization can compound -- deep optimization of the video inference stack, building switching costs through SDK integration and developer tooling, accumulating operational knowledge that generalist platforms never prioritize. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that video inference is different enough from text inference to sustain a standalone platform, that the open-source model ecosystem creates sufficient competition among model providers to prevent any single provider from verticalizing, and that the developer adoption flywheel can outrun the well-funded competitors' expansion plans. It's not impossible. But it requires three favorable conditions simultaneously, and I've learned -- painfully, with KiOR -- that bets requiring multiple assumptions to all break right are fragile.

The timing dimension is where Overshoot has its best argument. VLMs capable of real-time video understanding are genuinely new -- Qwen3-VL and InternVL3 crossed practical deployment thresholds in late 2024. The founders are building before the market is obvious, which is usually where I want to be. But there's a critical difference between being early on an exponential technology curve and being early on an infrastructure layer for that curve. When I backed OpenAI in 2019, I was betting on the rate of improvement in the models themselves -- the core technology that would reshape everything downstream. Overshoot isn't betting on the models; they're betting on the plumbing around someone else's models. The exponential curve benefits them, but it benefits everyone in the ecosystem equally. Being early on infrastructure only matters if you can accumulate advantages faster than competitors can replicate your optimizations. With 300 developers and a two-person team against companies with hundreds of millions in funding, that race is structurally unfavorable.

The founders are technically excellent -- that's not in question. Zakaria's path from Uber surge pricing to Meta AI inference engines to this company is logical and credentialed. Younes building COSMONiO's vision platform from scratch and seeing it through to Intel acquisition demonstrates execution. But by my framework, this is a team of domain experts doing domain-expert things. The greatest technology companies were built by people with "irreverence, foolish confidence and naivety" attacking problems they had no business solving. These founders are solving exactly the problem their careers trained them for, in exactly the way their experience suggests. That's a recipe for a competent business, not a category-defining company. I'd rather see these two take their exceptional technical skills and attack something where the consequence of success genuinely terrifies the incumbent -- reimagine how physical AI systems perceive the world, not just how they connect to inference APIs.
