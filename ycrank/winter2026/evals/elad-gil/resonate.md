# Resonate -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the commodity risk. Resonate's core feature set -- voice transcription, filler-word removal, emotion detection, voice-to-video conversion -- is built on APIs that any developer can access today. OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, off-the-shelf sentiment models. When I apply my "software-driven vs. software-aware" test, this is a messaging app that's software-aware. Strip away the AI features and the underlying business is a consumer messaging client competing against WhatsApp, iMessage, and Telegram -- platforms with billions of installed users and active development teams already shipping the same capabilities. WhatsApp added voice message transcription in late 2024. Apple is building AI processing into the OS layer through Apple Intelligence. The differentiation window isn't closing -- it's being absorbed incrementally by incumbents who have the distribution Resonate doesn't.

The structural moment question is where this falls apart for me. When I ask "what changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this market possible now?" the answer is: speech-to-text got much better, and voice messaging usage grew 49%. But those improvements benefit WhatsApp and iMessage more than they benefit a new entrant. This is the opposite of the pattern I look for. With Harvey, the technology threshold unlocked a new category that required deep workflow integration incumbents couldn't easily bolt on. With Coinbase, regulatory complexity created barriers that deterred fast followers. Here, the technology improvements are frictionless for incumbents to adopt -- there's no structural barrier preventing them from shipping every feature Resonate has. Messaging is one of the most well-understood, heavily competed markets in consumer tech. This isn't "too boring" or "too niche" -- it's one of the highest-visibility categories in technology, and every AI lab, messaging incumbent, and well-funded startup is looking at voice-AI features simultaneously.

The distribution challenge is existential, and the team seems to know it. Their YC page describes "a desperate need for virality and growth." That's honest, but it's also an admission that they haven't identified a distribution mechanism -- which is a significant red flag in my framework. Consumer messaging platforms have the strongest lock-in effects in technology: your contacts are on WhatsApp and iMessage, and switching costs are essentially your entire social graph. Resonate's cross-platform import feature (pull voice messages from WhatsApp, share interactive transcripts) is a reasonable wedge, but it positions the product as a layer on top of existing platforms rather than a replacement. And layers get squeezed when the platform beneath them adds the same functionality natively.

The multi-product signal concerns me most from an operational clarity standpoint. At pre-seed with what appears to be a two-person team, they're building Resonate Chat, Resonate Create ("Advanced Agentic Video platform"), and state that "many more are in the works." This is the multi-miracle problem in its clearest form. They need to simultaneously: (1) convince consumers to adopt a new messaging app, (2) stay ahead of incumbents absorbing their AI features, (3) build network effects from zero, and (4) figure out monetization in a market where messaging has been free for a decade. Each of these is a low-probability outcome. Compounded, they represent exactly the kind of plan I pass on.

The strongest bull case: voice is becoming the dominant input mode for a generation of users, and the first platform built natively around AI-processed voice could define a new category the way Figma defined collaborative design -- not by being "Sketch in a browser" but by creating workflows that didn't exist before. If emotion detection, AI coaching, and voice-to-video become as fundamental to communication as formatting is to documents, Resonate would be positioned at the center of a genuinely new behavior. The cross-app import and shareable transcript features could create a viral content format that pulls people in without requiring both sides to switch platforms. And the TAM is enormous -- even a 0.1% slice of the global messaging market is meaningful. For this to work, though, you'd need to believe that AI voice processing creates a sufficiently new experience category that incumbents can't replicate it by adding features incrementally. I don't see evidence for that discontinuity. The individual features -- transcription, filler removal, emotion tags -- are each nice-to-have additions to existing messaging, not a fundamentally different paradigm.

Sam Kaplan's credentials are solid -- Engineering Manager at Brex during its high-growth phase, Harvard CS, consistent shipping of AI projects. The app went from launch to v1.1.9 in about a month, which shows real velocity. Lily Zhao brings relevant product and business development experience across consumer and AI companies. These are competent builders. But I've seen great teams get taken out repeatedly by structural market dynamics, and the consumer messaging market against entrenched incumbents with billions of users is one of the hardest structural positions in technology. The founder quality doesn't override the market structure problem.
