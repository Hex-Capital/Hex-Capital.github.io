# Perfectly -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Perfectly: this is one of the most crowded categories I've seen in years. Over 100 AI recruiting startups launched in 2024-2025. Perfect — not Perfectly, but Perfect — raised $23M in seed funding for essentially the same premise, with a nearly identical name. Alex raised $20M. Dover has $20M and is already profitable. Gem has $148M and $31M in revenue. When I look at a space and everybody is rushing in, every VC wants a piece, and the thesis can be summarized in a sentence anyone would nod along to — "AI should automate recruiting" — that's consensus. That's the exact opposite of where I find my best investments. The companies that changed my portfolio were the ones people thought were insane. Nobody was competing with SpaceX in 2008. Nobody wanted to fund ride-sharing when it was illegal. AI recruiting in 2026 is the opposite of that — it's the popular thing, and Perfectly is entering a race where well-capitalized competitors already have significant head starts.

When I try to understand Victor and Gary's story, I find two strong ML engineers from TikTok and Meta who sat through 800+ bad agency-sourced interviews and decided to fix the process. I respect that. They've got genuine technical depth — NeurIPS publications, recommendation systems experience from two of the best matching algorithm companies on Earth. But what I'm listening for when a founder tells me their story is the thread that goes deeper than a workplace frustration. I want to hear about the thing that happened to them — not at their desk, but in their life — that means they'll keep building this when the money runs out, when a competitor with $23M in funding copies their feature set, when candidates start ignoring AI outreach. A bad interview process at a FAANG company is a real problem, but it's not the kind of biographical furnace that forges the resilience I've seen in founders who build through impossible odds. I don't feel the connection between who these founders are and why they must be the ones to solve this particular problem.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. If Perfectly's matching algorithm genuinely outperforms because these founders internalized TikTok's recommendation engine architecture, the agency model creates beautiful alignment — they only eat when they kill. That's a bold structural choice in a market where competitors hide behind SaaS subscriptions regardless of whether their product actually fills roles. If the data flywheel works — reusable candidate screens accumulating over time, hiring preferences getting sharper with each placement — there's a path to a real moat. And the $32B U.S. recruiting agency market is structurally vulnerable: high labor costs, slow cycles, misaligned incentives. An AI-native replacement that's genuinely better could capture significant share. The claim that candidates pass interviews at twice the rate of traditional agencies, if it holds up, would be a meaningful signal. But one unnamed client canceling competing subscriptions within two weeks is the kind of early anecdote that sounds impressive and proves very little.

What I keep coming back to is what this company does to the economic fabric. When I backed Uber, the thing that excited me wasn't just the technology — it was that hundreds of thousands of people who needed income could get behind the wheel and start earning. Postmates, same thing. Affirm gave people transparent access to credit. These companies created economic opportunity for people who didn't have it. Perfectly does the opposite: it automates away human recruiters. Many of those recruiters are people who came into the profession without traditional credentials — this is one of the industries where grit and hustle matter more than degrees. Replacing that workforce with AI isn't inherently wrong, but it's not the kind of impact that makes me lean forward. The hiring managers it serves are already well-resourced people at tech companies. There's no underserved population gaining access to something they were previously locked out of.

The regulatory landscape here — NYC's Local Law 144 on automated employment decision tools, the EU AI Act classifying employment AI as high-risk — is real complexity, but I don't see evidence these founders are treating it as a moat to build. In my best investments in regulated spaces, the founders had a strategy for navigating the complexity that would deter competitors. Here, regulation appears as a risk factor in the dossier, not as a deliberate competitive advantage. On co-founder dynamics, I'll note that both founders sharing a TikTok history is a decent foundation — they've worked together under pressure at a high-performance company. That's more than many founding teams have. But I don't have enough to assess how they handle real conflict, the kind that comes when the company is running out of money and the strategy needs to change.

This is a pass for me. Technically capable founders building in a space that's already crowded with consensus capital, solving a real but workplace-level frustration rather than a deeply personal problem, in a way that doesn't create economic access for underserved populations. The matching quality could differentiate them, but I don't see the biographical commitment or the anti-consensus positioning that characterizes my best investments.
