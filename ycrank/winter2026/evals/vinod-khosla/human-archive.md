# Human Archive -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Human Archive is who else is in the room. Scale AI -- a $29 billion company with $2 billion in annual revenue -- launched its Physical AI division in September 2025, collecting over a thousand hours of robotics demonstration data per day through a global contractor network. Sensei came through YC two batches ago building low-cost teleoperation hardware for crowdsourced robot data. Cortex AI, one batch behind, is running a marketplace model for the same buyer set, founded by someone who built a billion-dollar company. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, or NexGen to challenge Intel, those were outsiders with a fundamentally different technical architecture that the incumbents couldn't replicate without cannibalizing themselves. Here, I see four young founders collecting video data in India using unspecified "custom hardware" while a dominant incumbent with existing enterprise relationships, annotation infrastructure, and ten-figure revenue has already entered the identical market. That's not an outsider challenging a monopoly. That's a startup arriving at a crowded party where the bouncer is already inside.

Let me step back to the question I always ask first: if Human Archive succeeds completely, what changes? They become a premier data vendor for robotics foundation model companies. Some robots learn faster because the training data is higher quality. That's useful. It's a real business. But the consequence of their success is that they're an enabler -- someone else's robot transforms the factory floor, someone else's foundation model achieves generalization, someone else captures the value of embodied AI. The companies consuming this data are attacking trillion-dollar systems in manufacturing, logistics, and domestic labor. Human Archive is selling picks and shovels. I've made picks-and-shovels investments before, but only when the pick itself represented a structural technology breakthrough -- Square didn't just serve merchants, it replaced the entire payment infrastructure. Human Archive's data collection, as described in the dossier, is operationally intensive but not structurally different from what Scale AI's contractor army or Cortex AI's marketplace can produce. The ceiling on consequence is a good data business in a market projected at under $10 billion by 2029. My portfolio is built on bets where success rewires how entire industries operate. A data vendor with a small buyer set of frontier labs doesn't meet that bar.

The strongest version of the bull case goes like this: real-world multimodal data is the irreducible bottleneck for embodied AI, and the sim-to-real gap cannot be closed synthetically. If that's true, whoever builds the highest-quality real-world collection infrastructure wins a critical chokepoint. Human Archive's custom hardware and in-house annotation pipelines could produce fundamentally more aligned data than Scale AI's distributed contractor approach -- quality over quantity. The India-based operations give them a cost structure advantage. And the founding team's willingness to move continents, deploy hardware in residential and manufacturing environments, and build physical operations from scratch demonstrates genuine operational grit. If the buyer set expands from five frontier labs to fifty as robotics investment continues doubling year-over-year, the market could grow faster than projected. I take this seriously. But even in the optimistic case, the moat is operational execution, not structural -- and operational moats erode fast when a company with $2 billion in revenue and hundreds of global contractors decides to compete directly. The dossier explicitly notes "no structural barrier to Scale AI or other incumbents competing directly."

On the team: four undergraduate dropouts from Berkeley and Stanford, with prior ventures that topped out at selling mangoes and raising $15,000 in grant funding. Samay Maini's ML and robotics perception background at Contoro Robotics is the most directly relevant credential on the team. But for a company whose entire value proposition rests on "custom data-collection hardware," I see no evidence of deep hardware engineering expertise on the founding team. There are no GitHub repos with stars, no technical publications beyond one CHI paper from Shloke Patel. The operational experience from Mango United might translate to deploying collection infrastructure in Asia, but the gap between shipping boxes of fruit and deploying precision multimodal capture hardware across diverse environments is substantial. I'm not seeing the learning rate signal I look for -- the evidence of rapidly iterated assumptions, abandoned hypotheses, or thinking that's evolved dramatically over the YC batch. What I see instead is a capable young team executing a reasonable playbook in a category that five other entities are simultaneously pursuing.

The timing trajectory is the one dimension where this company scores above neutral. Robotics VC investment doubled to $7.2 billion. Physical Intelligence raised $600 million. NVIDIA launched GR00T. The demand curve for real-world robotics training data is exponential and accelerating. But being positioned on a good wave is necessary, not sufficient -- and Human Archive isn't ahead of the wave. They're riding it alongside Scale AI, Sensei, and Cortex AI. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, I was four years ahead of the AI venture consensus. When I backed cleantech in 2004, most VCs hadn't considered it. Human Archive is entering a category that Scale AI validated publicly six months ago and that three YC batches have now produced companies in. That's consensus timing, not contrarian timing.

I pass. The consequence of success is a useful data services business, not a transformed industry. The technology differentiation is asserted but unsubstantiated. The competitive landscape features a dominant incumbent and multiple direct competitors. And the team, while young and energetic, hasn't demonstrated the kind of contrarian courage or technical depth that makes me believe they'll outrun Scale AI's billion-dollar machine. These founders are clearly ambitious -- dropping out and moving to Asia to build takes real conviction. I'd tell them: you're smart enough and gutsy enough to attack a bigger problem. Don't build the data pipeline for someone else's revolution. Build the thing that changes how the physical world works.
