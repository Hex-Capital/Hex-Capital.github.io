# Panta -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what jumps out immediately: there are at least five YC-backed companies pursuing AI-powered commercial insurance brokerage right now. Harper, Fernstone, RiskCube, and now Panta — all within a few batches of each other, all attacking the same "human API" bottleneck with broadly similar technology. When I see that density of consensus around an idea, my antenna goes up — not because the problem isn't real, but because the returns get arbitraged away before the first policy is bound. Harper is one batch ahead with $2.3M in revenue and a 25-person team. Panta's founding team is four people with "multiple commercial policies" placed. That's not a fatal gap at pre-seed, but it means Panta is running a race where someone with identical weapons already has a measurable lead, and three other runners are on the same track. The idea that AI can automate insurance brokerage is not insane — it's the most obvious application of document-processing LLMs that anyone in the industry can articulate. The founders are credible engineers (Google ML, Apple full-stack), but they're credible engineers pursuing a consensus AI application with no visible insurance domain expertise. That's the weakest version of the founder-idea pairing I look for.

The structural question I keep returning to: would this be a good business if AI didn't exist? The answer is clearly no. Without AI agents, Panta is just another insurance brokerage that needs to hire hundreds of brokers — which is exactly what Marsh, Aon, and Willis Towers Watson already are. The entire value proposition IS the AI automation. That puts it squarely in the category I avoid — companies where AI is the core product rather than the "cherry on top." Compare this to Craftwork, where painting crews do actual physical work and software optimizes scheduling and dispatch. You can't download a painting crew. But you can absolutely build competing AI agents that process insurance documents, especially as the underlying models get cheaper and more capable every quarter. The moat here isn't the AI — it's supposed to be the regulatory position and carrier relationships. And those are real: surplus lines licensing across all 50 states is not trivial, and 100+ carrier relationships took effort to build. But those are necessary-not-sufficient barriers. Harper has them. Any well-funded insurtech can obtain them. The data moat the dossier describes as "developing" is theoretical at this stage — you need years of proprietary placement data across specialty verticals before that compounds into genuine defensibility.

The bull case I want to take seriously: Panta's focus on heavy industry and specialty surplus lines (explosive materials, oil & gas, construction) is genuinely the right wedge. These are the hardest risks to place, where broker bottlenecks are most acute, and where the documentation complexity is highest — 70 pages of chemistry specs for explosive materials is exactly the kind of unstructured document processing where AI has the largest advantage over a human broker shuffling papers. The innovator's dilemma argument is structurally sound: Marsh and Aon cannot automate away 52% market share built on human broker headcount without cannibalizing their own organizational logic. And the business model itself — commission-based brokerage revenue — is inherently a service business, not SaaS. If Panta can genuinely achieve "service business with software economics," the margin profile is extraordinary. A brokerage earning 10-15% commission on premiums with near-zero marginal cost per policy placed is a printing press. That's a real insight. What would have to be true for this to work: Panta would need to build an insurmountable data advantage in specialty verticals before Harper or anyone else gets there, while simultaneously proving to carriers that AI-processed submissions are trustworthy for catastrophic-risk policies. That's a narrow path, but it's a real one.

Where the structural logic breaks for me is the protocol question. Panta is not creating a new primitive. It's applying existing technology to an existing industry structure. It's not building a layer that other businesses build on — it's an application of LLMs to a specific workflow. The narrative can expand (specialty lines to all commercial insurance to all insurance), but that narrative is shared with every competitor in the space. There's no compounding network effect where Panta's success makes other companies' products better. It's a service business competing for market share in a large, fragmented industry. That can produce a good outcome — maybe a few hundred million dollar business — but it doesn't produce the kind of winner-take-most dynamics I look for in my best investments. The ceiling is a very good brokerage, not a new financial primitive. Venmo created a new payment layer; Panta is automating an existing one. The distinction matters enormously for long-term compounding.

I'll give credit where it's due: the 99% placement rate and 4.9-star rating from 127 reviews suggest real operational quality, and the all-50-states licensing represents genuine asset value at pre-seed. The team's technical depth in ML and full-stack engineering is directly relevant to the core challenge. But when I weigh all of this against a consensus idea in a crowded competitive field, an AI-first value proposition that contradicts my structural thesis, and no evidence of domain expertise in insurance itself, I can't get to conviction. This is a competent team building what everyone else is building, one step behind the leader.
