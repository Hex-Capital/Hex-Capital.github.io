# Kita -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

What catches my attention first about Kita isn't the technology or the team credentials — it's the structural problem underneath. Fifty percent of Filipinos are unbanked, yet over 60% of transactions now flow through e-wallets. That means there's an entire financial identity for hundreds of millions of people that exists but is invisible — locked inside screenshots, PDFs of utility bills, payslips nobody can parse at scale. Kita is trying to make those invisible signals legible. That pattern — taking an opaque system and making it transparent — is one I've seen create enormous value. Carta did it for cap tables, Affirm did it for credit terms, Flock Safety did it for neighborhood safety data. When you make hidden information visible, you create access where exclusion existed before. The economic access thesis here is probably the strongest dimension of this company from my perspective. If Kita works, it doesn't just optimize a workflow — it's the infrastructure layer that lets lenders say yes to people who were previously unfundable. That matters to me on a level that goes beyond market sizing.

Carmel Limcaoco being from Manila is meaningful. She's not a tourist founder who read a McKinsey report about Southeast Asian fintech and decided to build there — she grew up in this market, she understands the document types and the lending culture in her bones. A UN award at 16, launching the first Product Fellowship in the Philippines, founding DAHA at Stanford — she's clearly someone who builds things and has been doing it since she was young. And Rhea Malhotra winning the Firestone Medal for best CS thesis at Stanford is genuinely exceptional technical credibility. The pairing makes sense: a CEO with deep local context and product instincts alongside a CTO whose computer vision and ML research is directly applicable to the core technology. But when I ask myself the question I always ask — tell me your story, not the business — what I'm hearing is impressive credentials and a cultural connection to the market, not the kind of personal hardship or survival narrative that tells me this founder will keep going when the company hits its darkest moment. Carmel's path through Stanford and Apple is a strong one, but it doesn't give me that signal of having been forged through real adversity. I might be wrong — the dossier may not capture the full story — but based on what I can see, the biographical thread is cultural and intellectual rather than born from lived pain.

The honest challenge for me is that this is a sensible bet, and I don't do my best work on sensible bets. Document intelligence for lending is a proven category — Ocrolus raised $142 million doing essentially this for the US market. Kita's insight is to hyperlocalize it for emerging markets where the documents are messier and the incumbents haven't bothered to go. That's smart. It's logical. It's the kind of opportunity where the pitch makes sense on slide three and most investors nod along. But the companies I write first checks into — SpaceX, Crusoe Energy, Contraline — are the ones where most investors are shaking their heads, where the idea sounds borderline absurd until it suddenly doesn't. Kita doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. Nobody hears "we process lending documents in the Philippines using AI" and thinks you've lost your mind. The emerging market focus adds operational complexity that deters lazy competitors, and the VLM timing is real, but the core concept is well-understood. The anti-consensus signal I look for just isn't here.

That said, the bull case deserves genuine engagement. If Carmel's local network and cultural fluency allow Kita to lock in lender relationships across the Philippines and Indonesia faster than anyone else, and if the data feedback loop — linking document signals to actual repayment outcomes — compounds quickly enough, then by the time a well-funded competitor decides to enter these markets, Kita already owns the training data and the integrations. A six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage and 30% month-over-month growth across multiple SE Asian markets is real signal, especially for a two-person pre-seed team. The regulatory complexity of operating across multiple emerging market lending regimes could become a genuine moat, similar to what I've seen in financial services companies where compliance burden deters fast followers. If the feedback loop works — if every document processed makes fraud detection and risk assessment measurably better — then Kita becomes harder to displace with each passing quarter. The best version of this company is the Plaid of emerging market lending, and that's a very large outcome.

But I keep coming back to the question of whether this is my kind of bet. The economic access dimension is powerful and real. The regulatory complexity creates structural advantage. The team is technically credentialed and culturally connected. These are all good things. What's missing for me is the visceral, intuitive energy — that jolt I felt with Niantic, or the "this sounds insane but it's actually grounded in real physics" quality of Crusoe Energy. Kita is a well-constructed company attacking a real problem with appropriate technology at a reasonable time. For many investors, that's exactly what they're looking for. For me, it doesn't quite cross the threshold where I'd write a check from my own money, because the weirdness and the founder grit signals that drive my highest-conviction bets aren't present at the level I need.
