# Shofo -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the structural problem with Shofo that I can't get past: this is a business that gets *weaker* as AI gets *better*. The core value proposition is a human-in-the-loop pipeline that cleans, segments, and labels video data for AI labs. But labeling -- annotation, segmentation, object detection -- is precisely the task where AI capability is improving fastest. Every generation of foundation models makes auto-labeling cheaper and more accurate. You're building the business that your own customers' products are actively destroying. Craftwork's painting crews don't get replaced by better AI -- they get more efficiently dispatched. Shofo's annotation pipeline is a cost center on a depreciation curve. That's not a "cherry on top" business. That's a melting ice cube with a nice logo.

The founder-idea calibration doesn't work for me either. I need a sane person with an insane idea, and this is the opposite configuration -- young founders with a very sane idea. "AI labs need video training data" is not a contrarian thesis. It's a TAM slide. Every VC in the ecosystem understands that multimodal models are hungry for video data. The founders built Correkt to 40k users as undergrads, which shows real hustle and shipping ability -- I respect that energy. But none of them have operated inside an AI lab, built data infrastructure at scale, or have the kind of deep domain credibility that makes me trust a team to navigate the labyrinth of platform access, copyright litigation, and enterprise sales cycles that this business demands. Andre Braga's NLP research at UCSB is a start, but it's a very early-career start. When I backed Anatoly Yakovenko at Solana, the "sane" part was years of systems engineering at Qualcomm building the exact kind of high-throughput architecture Solana required. I don't see that level of founder-domain lock here.

The platform dependency issue is existential in a way that most investors underweight. Shofo's index pulls from TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X. Each of those platforms can unilaterally destroy Shofo's data pipeline by changing API terms or enforcing ToS restrictions -- and they have every incentive to do so as they realize the commercial value of their video corpus for AI training. This isn't hypothetical friction. This is the entire data supply sitting on someone else's infrastructure, subject to someone else's business decisions. The "Common Crawl for Video" analogy is seductive but structurally misleading: Common Crawl indexes the open web, where no single entity controls access. Social media platforms are walled gardens with lawyers. The analogy breaks exactly where defensibility matters.

The strongest bull case -- and I want to engage with it honestly -- runs through the Scale AI neutrality crisis. Meta's 49% stake in Scale AI genuinely disrupted the market structure. Google and OpenAI need alternatives for data labeling, and Shofo's bundled approach (sourcing plus labeling, not just labeling) addresses a real gap. If Shofo could become the trusted, neutral video data layer that AI labs default to because Scale AI is now Meta's subsidiary, that's a meaningful wedge. You could imagine this evolving into genuine infrastructure -- a queryable index that becomes so comprehensive and well-annotated that building your own pipeline is more expensive than paying Shofo. The 32% CAGR in video annotation spending is real demand. And first-mover advantage in building the most comprehensive short-form video index could compound if annotation quality improves with each client engagement. For this to work, though, you'd need the platforms to tolerate the scraping indefinitely, the copyright landscape to resolve favorably, the AI labs to prefer buying over building, and the labeling pipeline to stay ahead of automated alternatives. That's a lot of "ifs" stacked on top of each other.

The "new primitive" aspiration is the most charitable read, and I'll grant that there's a version of this story where the video index itself becomes infrastructure. But a data index isn't a protocol. It doesn't create the kind of compounding network effects where other companies' products improve when your product succeeds. Nobody builds *on top of* Shofo's index the way developers build on Helium's wireless network or Aleo's zero-knowledge infrastructure. Shofo's customers consume its output and move on. That's a service relationship, not a primitive. And the "world's largest index of short-form videos" claim is unverified -- at pre-seed, with a team of four, I'm skeptical about the actual scale and quality relative to what a well-resourced lab could build internally in a quarter.

Ultimately, this sits in a category I actively avoid: an AI-dependent business where removing AI from the equation leaves you with nothing. If AI didn't exist, there's no Shofo. The entire business IS the AI ecosystem play. I look for businesses that would be great without AI but become exceptional with it. This is the inverse. The founders show real energy and I wouldn't be surprised if they find some initial traction riding the video data demand wave, but the structural logic doesn't match how I invest.
