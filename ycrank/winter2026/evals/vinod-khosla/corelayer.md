# Corelayer -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Corelayer's website features a cost savings calculator: 100 engineers at $200K each, reduce debugging time from 20% to 6%, save $2.8M per year. That calculator is the entire problem. When a founder leads with arithmetic about labor cost reduction, I know exactly what I'm looking at -- a company that has optimized for provable ROI at the expense of ambition. The consequence of success here is that Fortune 100 companies spend slightly less on first-line production support. That is a real pain point, a real market, and a real business. It is also, from where I sit, a problem whose consequence of success does not justify the effort of the most talented people working on it. Nobody's world changes because on-call engineers debug data pipelines 14% faster. The magnitude fails my first test.

What concerns me more than the TAM or competitive landscape is the founder profile. Both Mitch and Shipra built data infrastructure at Goldman Sachs, and now they're building tools for companies like Goldman Sachs. This is textbook insider execution -- they know the pain intimately, they have the relationships, and they're building precisely what their former colleagues would buy. That pattern produces solid companies. It almost never produces transformational ones. When I backed Pradeep Sindhu at Juniper, his power was that he came from Xerox PARC and didn't know what the networking industry considered impossible. When I backed Pat Brown, his power was that he was a biochemist who had never set foot in a food processing plant. Insiders know the constraints too well -- they aim for 14 percentage points of efficiency gain because they understand exactly what the organization will buy. Outsiders aim to eliminate the problem entirely because they don't know they can't.

The competitive dynamics here amplify my concern. Resolve AI just raised $125M at a billion-dollar valuation building autonomous SRE tools. incident.io raised $62M and has $9M in revenue doing incident lifecycle management. BigPanda has $431M in funding. PagerDuty is a public company doing $440M in annual revenue. Corelayer's differentiation -- data-content-level debugging with confidential compute for regulated industries -- is a genuine wedge, but it's a narrow one in a space where multiple well-capitalized players are converging on AI-powered incident resolution simultaneously. When I see a 2-person pre-seed company entering a market where the nearest competitor just raised at a billion-dollar valuation, I need to see either a fundamentally different technology approach or a consequence magnitude so vast that capturing even a sliver justifies the bet. I see neither.

The strongest bull case would require believing that data-level AI debugging is a wedge into something far larger -- that an agent which truly understands production data flows, code, and system architecture at deep structural levels could evolve into autonomous software maintenance, or even autonomous software engineering. If Corelayer's agents, trained on the most complex regulated data environments in the world, develop a capability that generalizes beyond debugging into building and operating entire systems, then the consequence of success expands by orders of magnitude. The regulated-industry positioning could also become a genuine moat -- confidential compute deployment in financial services and healthcare creates compliance barriers that cloud-native competitors like Resolve AI cannot easily cross. And the timing is legitimately favorable: LLM reasoning capabilities crossed a threshold in 2024-2025 that makes multi-step debugging agents feasible for the first time. If I squint, I can construct a path where this company's regulated-industry beachhead becomes the training ground for the most capable autonomous engineering agents in the world. But that path requires the founders to have ambitions far beyond what their current positioning suggests, and nothing in the dossier indicates they're thinking at that scale.

The technology itself -- monitoring logs, detecting anomalies, performing LLM-powered root cause analysis -- uses capabilities that are individually accessible to every well-funded observability company in the market. The dossier is transparent about this commoditization risk. What Corelayer combines (data-level inspection plus confidential compute plus on-prem deployment) is harder to replicate as a bundle, but it's an integration play, not a fundamental technology breakthrough. There is no 10x cost reduction here, no capability that didn't exist before, no structural change that makes the incumbent approach uneconomic. Datadog still works fine; Corelayer just adds a layer on top of it. When I invested in Square, the technology made traditional POS infrastructure economically obsolete for small merchants. When I invested in Juniper, TCP/IP routing made legacy telecom switching architectures structurally uncompetitive. I need to see that kind of displacement potential, and a better debugging workflow does not reach that bar.

I respect the founders' domain knowledge and the genuine pain they experienced at Goldman. SOC 2 Type I certification at this stage shows execution discipline. But these are signals of a company that will navigate enterprise sales competently, not signals of a company that will transform an industry. They've reduced their failure risk by choosing a problem they understand deeply, in an industry they know how to sell to, with technology components that are proven. And in doing so, they've built a company whose success -- even total success -- produces a good business in a crowded market, not a new way the world operates.
