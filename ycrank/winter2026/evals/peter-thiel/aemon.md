# Aemon -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of Aemon is not what it claims to have built, but how many other people have built the same thing. The dossier lists OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve as open-source implementations that have replicated and in some cases surpassed AlphaEvolve's benchmark results. An independent team using something called "Tactical Maniac v0.5" may have achieved the very circle packing record Aemon claims. This is the signature of a technique that has already diffused into the commons -- not a secret, but a known method being simultaneously pursued by many actors. When I ask my standard question -- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" -- the honest answer from Aemon would be: "We believe evolutionary LLM search can solve hard optimization problems." But after DeepMind published AlphaEvolve in May 2025 and demonstrated exactly this, that truth is no longer non-consensus. It is the consensus. And when everyone agrees on the thesis, you are not building a monopoly -- you are entering a competition.

The mimetic dynamics here are unusually transparent. Aemon defines itself explicitly against AlphaEvolve -- their benchmark is AlphaEvolve's benchmark, their framing is "we beat AlphaEvolve," their differentiation is "unlike AlphaEvolve, we're commercially available." This is definitionally imitative positioning. The company did not discover a secret about the world and build technology to exploit it; it observed a powerful demonstration by Google and raced to productize the same approach before Google does. Girard would recognize this pattern immediately -- the model (DeepMind) becomes the rival, and the imitator's identity becomes defined by the gap between itself and the model. When multiple imitators enter simultaneously (which has happened -- the open-source ecosystem is already crowded), the result is mutual destruction, not monopoly. The entire category of "AlphaEvolve-but-commercial" is a Red Ocean forming in real time.

The founders deserve more careful consideration than the thesis. Ray Xu and Richard Zhou are twin brothers who published at ICLR and EMNLP before turning twenty, dropped out of strong technical universities, and Richard holds international medals in mathematics and robotics. This profile -- precocious, technically brilliant, unconventional enough to leave university -- is one I take seriously. I backed Vitalik Buterin at nineteen because he had a non-consensus vision for programmable money that most experts thought was nonsensical. But Buterin's conviction was not about executing someone else's demonstrated technique more quickly; it was about a genuinely new architecture for trust that the world had not seen. The Xu-Zhou brothers have demonstrated research ability. What I cannot see is definite conviction about a future that only they envision. Their positioning -- "AlphaEvolve for external teams" -- is responsive to DeepMind's work, not generative of a new category. A Founder in Residence program at Afore Capital followed by YC suggests a well-supported path, but well-supported is not the same as conviction-tested. I have no evidence they have refused an easier path or held a vision against pressure, because the vision itself appears to be "productize what Google proved works."

The bull case is worth articulating. If you believe that the distance between "technique works on benchmarks" and "reliable enterprise product that engineers trust for production R&D" is enormous -- and it often is -- then Aemon could become the Palantir of algorithmic optimization. Palantir succeeded not because its data-fusion techniques were theoretically novel, but because it built the operational infrastructure, the deployment machinery, and the trust relationships that made the technology usable by non-researchers in high-stakes environments. If Aemon executes a similar transformation -- turning evolutionary LLM search into a product that an engineering VP at a Fortune 500 company can deploy against their hardest optimization problems with production-grade reliability -- the compute efficiency advantage (less than ten dollars for a world-record result, if verified) could compound into genuine cost moats over time. The legal retrieval case study showing a 68.9% improvement in recall is the kind of concrete, measurable result that enterprise buyers care about. And Google's research lab structure does make it genuinely difficult to build great commercial software for external customers. This is the path I would want to see: not "we beat AlphaEvolve on a benchmark" but "we are the only team that can make this technology work reliably inside your engineering workflow."

But the structural problems remain severe. There is no network effect in an optimization tool -- each customer's R&D problems are independent, and the product does not become more valuable as more customers use it in any obvious way. There is no proprietary technology that has been demonstrated to be categorically superior to what is freely available in open source. There is no switching cost once a solution is generated -- the output is code, and code is portable. Google could commercialize AlphaEvolve at any time, and when it does, it brings frontier models, unlimited compute, and existing enterprise relationships. Sakana AI has already raised $479 million for a related thesis. The market structure here is precisely what I avoid: multiple well-funded players and open-source alternatives all pursuing the same insight. The absence of a genuine secret -- a truth that most experts reject -- means there is no structural basis for monopoly, and without monopoly, there are no returns worth pursuing at the power-law scale I require.
