# Mendral -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my problem with Mendral: these might be the most qualified founders on earth for this specific product, and that's precisely what makes this a trap. Sam Alba was Docker's first hire, scaled the engineering team from 3 to 100+. Andrea Luzzardi architected Docker's core platform, built Swarm, worked storage infrastructure at Google. They co-founded Dagger together — a CI/CD pipeline engine that raised $30M+ from Redpoint. They have spent their entire careers building the plumbing that modern software delivery runs on. The "sane" side of my filter is maxed out. I've rarely seen founders with more directly relevant domain experience. But the idea — an AI agent that monitors CI/CD pipelines and auto-fixes failures — is not insane. It's the single most obvious application of large language models to DevOps that anyone could conceive. When I describe my investment filter as "sane person, insane idea," the magic is in the combination. A sane person with a sane idea just means the returns are already priced in by every investor who can read a pitch deck.

Run my AI kill test on this and the result is immediate: remove AI from Mendral and there is no business. Zero. The entire value proposition IS the LLM generating code fixes from CI failure logs. This is not "cherry on top" — this is "cherry IS the sundae." The dossier itself states the quiet part out loud: "The core capability — using LLMs to diagnose CI failures and generate code fixes — is technically reproducible. Any team with CI/CD domain expertise and access to frontier LLMs could build a similar agent." When the company's own competitive analysis admits the technology is reproducible, you're looking at a feature, not a business. I'd rather invest in a plumbing company that uses software to dispatch crews than a software company whose entire existence depends on the current generation of LLMs staying ahead of what GitHub ships natively in Actions next quarter.

The GitHub platform dependency is the structural issue that keeps me up at night with this category. Mendral distributes as a GitHub App. Its entire product surface area is mediated by GitHub's platform. GitHub Copilot is already expanding into agentic workflows. Microsoft has every incentive and capability to integrate AI-powered failure diagnosis directly into Actions — it would be a natural extension of Copilot's agent mode. When your distribution channel is also your most dangerous competitor, you're in a position that even extraordinary founders can't navigate indefinitely. This is the application-layer trap I see constantly: you're building on someone else's infrastructure with no ability to become a standard or primitive that others depend on. Mendral doesn't create a new layer — it sits on top of GitHub's layer, and GitHub can absorb it whenever they choose.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement because the founder credentials are this strong. If Alba and Luzzardi's decade-plus of CI/CD infrastructure experience translates into a learning loop that genuinely compounds — where each customer deployment generates failure-pattern data that makes the system measurably better in ways a generic LLM agent cannot replicate — then you have a data flywheel that creates real switching costs. PostHog is a serious company; having them as a paying customer pre-seed is a meaningful signal. Five paying customers and 15 teams in production at this stage demonstrates that the product works and engineers trust it enough to let it open PRs against their codebase. If you believe that the accumulated per-customer learning data creates defensibility faster than GitHub can build a generic version, and that the Dagger community provides distribution into exactly the right buyer persona, then the founders' operational credibility could translate into a land-and-expand motion that establishes them before incumbents move. That's the case. I just don't believe it, because the history of developer tools built as applications on top of platforms with massive distribution is a graveyard of companies that were better products for a window of time before the platform caught up.

The attention split with Dagger is another wrinkle I can't ignore. Alba's LinkedIn still lists Dagger as his current role, and Dagger appears to be an active company. The relationship between the two ventures is opaque from public sources. Are they leaving Dagger? Running both? Did Mendral spin out of Dagger? The "rizz and tizz" test requires maniacal operational focus, and splitting attention between a $30M+ funded company and a pre-seed startup is the opposite of that — unless there's a clean transition story I'm not seeing.

Bottom line: these founders would be in my top decile for any company in their domain. The problem is the domain they've chosen sits squarely in the category I avoid most aggressively — an AI-first developer tool where the AI is the entire product, distributed as an application on an incumbent's platform, in a space so obvious that the largest software company on earth is already building toward it. Exceptional founders executing a consensus idea in a structurally vulnerable position. I pass.
