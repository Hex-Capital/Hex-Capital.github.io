# FullSeam -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The founding team is the strongest signal in this dossier, and it's a genuinely good one. Three co-founders who built TaxProper together through YC S19, scaled it to process over $1 billion per year in property tax payments across 115,000+ properties, raised from Khosla Ventures, sold to Opendoor in 2022, worked together through the post-acquisition integration, and then came back to build again. That's a team that's been stress-tested across the full startup lifecycle -- co-founder dynamics, fundraising, scaling financial operations software, enterprise procurement, and exit mechanics. When I evaluate repeat founders who've exited together in a directly adjacent domain, that team signal carries real weight. Dowling's policy background combined with Segal's statistical rigor and Coppa's product experience at TaxProper gives them an unusual cross-functional foundation for building financial operations software specifically.

But the market they've chosen concerns me. AI agents for accounting is one of the most consensus categories in venture right now. Bill.com has already shipped "BILL AI Agents" for touchless B2B transactions. Tipalti raised $200 million in growth financing explicitly earmarked for AI capabilities. When I evaluate a market, my first question is always: what has changed structurally in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now? The answer here -- LLMs crossed the fidelity threshold for interpreting financial documents and making GL coding decisions -- is correct. But it's equally correct for every other team building in this space and for every incumbent adding AI features. When the structural enabler benefits all participants simultaneously, there's no asymmetric position to exploit. Compare this to my Harvey investment: the legal AI team was building workflow and enterprise relationships before GPT-4 shipped, capturing position ahead of the capability curve. FullSeam is launching into a market where incumbents with 500,000+ existing customers are already deploying the same capability.

There is one structural angle that's more interesting than it first appears. FullSeam's cross-platform agent architecture -- logging into a company's existing QuickBooks, Stripe, Xero, NetSuite, Bill.com, and Salesforce simultaneously -- creates a tension that incumbents structurally cannot replicate. Bill.com's business model depends on customers conducting transactions within its ecosystem. An agent that orchestrates across Bill.com and its competitors simultaneously would cannibalize Bill.com's own platform lock-in. This is the kind of structural wedge I look for: not a feature advantage, but a business-model conflict that prevents the incumbent from following. If FullSeam executes well, the cross-platform integration surface creates compounding switching costs as GL mappings, vendor communication templates, and approval workflows get configured across the full tool stack. That's a distribution position, not just a product.

The bull case I'd need to believe: this is the Gusto pattern. Gusto looked like "just payroll" but became the HR operating system for every small business in America. FullSeam could look like "just AR/AP automation" but become the AI operations layer for every mid-market finance team -- expanding from accounts receivable and payable into FP&A, treasury management, audit preparation, and procurement. The architecture supports it. The team has the domain depth to execute it. And once you're embedded as the agent layer across a company's entire financial tool stack, you become the distribution channel for every new financial workflow automation. That trajectory -- from point solution to platform -- is how the best companies in my portfolio were built. But for this bull case to work, FullSeam needs to establish category leadership before Bill.com's AI Agents and Tipalti's $200M AI investment close the gap. The window is narrow when incumbents are already moving.

The single miracle here is making AI agents reliable enough for production financial operations -- handling the edge cases in partial payment matching, multi-currency reconciliation, and GL coding with the accuracy that controllers and CFOs will trust. That's a real miracle, and it's achievable given current model capabilities. But it's the same miracle every competitor is solving simultaneously. The founders' TaxProper experience -- building production-grade financial operations software that processed real money at scale -- gives them credibility on execution, but doesn't give them a structural advantage on the core AI reliability challenge. The deeper question is whether reliability becomes a commodity (delivered by the foundation model labs) or a compounding advantage (built through proprietary training data from enterprise deployments). If it's the former, FullSeam's differentiation erodes quickly. If the latter, first-mover deployment volume matters, and the team's execution velocity becomes the determining factor.

I'm landing at a neutral position. The team is meaningfully above average for pre-seed -- repeat founders with a relevant exit together are rare. But the market is firmly consensus, the "why now" doesn't advantage them specifically, and the incumbents are already responding with significant resources. This isn't a market that appears "too boring" or "too niche" to other investors -- it's a market where every investor I know has already seen a dozen pitches. The cross-platform structural tension is the most interesting angle, but it needs more evidence that it translates into actual competitive durability rather than just a product architecture choice.
