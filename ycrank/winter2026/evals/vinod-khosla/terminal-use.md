# Terminal Use -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

"Vercel for background agents." That tagline tells me everything I need to know about the ceiling of this company's ambition. When a founder defines their vision relative to another company's business model rather than relative to the scale of a problem, they've already told me the consequence of success: a nice infrastructure business. Not a transformation of how the world works. When Pat Brown came to me, he didn't say "I'm building the Tyson Foods for plants." He said he was going to eliminate animal agriculture. The ambition was calibrated to the problem -- half the planet's arable land, 25% of global freshwater. Terminal Use is calibrated to a competitor's market positioning. If this works perfectly -- every developer deploying background agents uses Terminal Use -- developers save time configuring Docker containers and filesystem management. That's a real business. It's not a reason to get out of bed.

The competitive landscape here is the clearest red flag. E2B has $21M and claims 88% of the Fortune 100 signed up. Daytona has $31M and hit $1M ARR in under three months. Modal Labs has $111M and a $1.1B valuation. Blaxel has $7.8M from First Round Capital. And Vercel itself -- the company Terminal Use explicitly defines itself against -- is entering the agent hosting space with Fluid compute and an established developer distribution channel that Terminal Use cannot match. The dossier states plainly that "the core technical components -- container orchestration, filesystem isolation, CLI tooling -- are well-understood infrastructure patterns." Terminal Use is entering a race where five funded competitors have a massive head start, the technical building blocks are commoditized, and the company naming itself after the incumbent is watching that incumbent build the same product. This isn't Juniper challenging Cisco when Cisco's CTO said they'd never build a TCP/IP router. This is five companies plus the incumbent all building the same thing simultaneously.

Three ex-Palantir engineers building developer infrastructure tools. This is the precise pattern I've warned about for decades -- industry insiders executing the industry's playbook. They know what Palantir built, they know how infrastructure works, and they're building... more infrastructure. There's no outsider perspective here, no "irreverence, foolish confidence and naivety" that produced Rocket Lab or Impossible Foods. Vivek Raja's experience leading agent deployment across US hospitals at Palantir is genuinely relevant, but relevant experience is not the same as contrarian vision. The team is homogeneous -- same employer, same technical backgrounds, no diversity of problem-solving approaches, no go-to-market capability visible. They've assembled to execute a plan, not to challenge an assumption the world holds wrong.

The strongest bull case: we are at the very beginning of the agent era, analogous to web hosting in 1998. The $200 billion TAM projections for agentic AI by 2034 suggest whoever owns the deployment layer for agents could become the next AWS. Vivek's Palantir experience with hospital agent deployments gives the team genuine insight into production pain points that pure infrastructure players lack. The filesystem-centric architectural bet could prove prescient if agents remain fundamentally stateful rather than evolving toward stateless API patterns. And the timing is real -- agent SDKs from Anthropic and OpenAI are proliferating, creating a genuine gap in production deployment infrastructure. For this to work, Terminal Use would need to win developer mindshare against five better-funded competitors and Vercel simultaneously, the filesystem-centric architectural bet would need to be correct (not a given -- the industry could move toward stateless patterns), and they'd need to convert CLI adoption into enterprise lock-in before the window closes. That's a lot of simultaneous low-probability requirements. When a plan requires the architecture AND the market timing AND beating five funded competitors AND the incumbent not executing -- and the technology itself is composed of well-understood components -- I see a company that hasn't identified which single risk to eliminate first.

The timing trajectory deserves acknowledgment -- the agent infrastructure wave is genuinely accelerating, and the underlying technology curves (LLM capability, agent SDK maturity) are exponential. But this isn't 2019 OpenAI, where I was early before the trend was consensus. Agent infrastructure in early 2026 is fully consensus. The fact that five companies have raised $170M+ in aggregate for this space means the window where being early matters has already closed. Terminal Use isn't skating to where the puck will be -- they're arriving at the rink after the game started.

I pass. The consequence of success is a developer tools business in a crowded market with commoditized technical components and better-funded competitors. These are smart engineers who could be working on something that matters at the scale their talent deserves.
