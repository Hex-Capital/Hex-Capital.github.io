# Button Computer -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking fact about Button Computer is not the company itself -- it's the graveyard it's walking into. Humane raised $240 million and shut down. Limitless raised $15 million at a $350 million valuation and got absorbed by Meta. And Rabbit R1, which we funded at Khosla Ventures for $30 million, is attempting something far more ambitious and still struggling to find product-market fit. The standalone AI wearable category has consumed nearly $300 million in venture capital and produced zero sustainable independent companies. Button's response to this carnage is to enter the same category with a simpler, cheaper device. That's not contrarian -- that's taking the most well-documented failure mode in consumer hardware and deciding the problem was that previous attempts were too ambitious. They've reduced the probability of failure by narrowing the ambition, and in doing so, they've made the consequence of success entirely inconsequential.

Let me be precise about what "success" means for Button. If everything goes right -- they ship on time, customers love it, they sell millions of units -- what have they built? A $179 Bluetooth clip-on that relays your voice to an LLM API and plays back the response. The consequence is that you don't have to reach into your pocket to talk to ChatGPT. That's a convenience improvement to an interaction that already takes ten seconds on your phone. Compare this to what I look for: Impossible Foods disrupting $1.7 trillion in animal agriculture, Commonwealth Fusion replacing fossil fuel power generation, Square making card payments accessible to 30 million small merchants who couldn't get a merchant account. Button, at its most successful, is a consumer electronics accessory. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No industry becomes structurally obsolete. I backed Juniper because TCP/IP routing would make Cisco's entire architecture irrelevant -- the technology made the incumbent approach uneconomic. Button's technology (Bluetooth mic, API call, text-to-speech) makes nothing uneconomic. It's entirely commodity. The dossier says it plainly: the core stack is "technically reproducible," the hardware is commodity, and an open-source competitor already exists on GitHub.

The strongest bull case I can construct goes something like this: voice is the natural interface for AI, smartphones are awkward for voice interaction, and the device that makes AI truly ambient in physical space becomes the next AirPods -- a $20+ billion annual category. If AI becomes as fundamental as the internet, the frictionless access point could be enormous. The founders worked on Vision Pro at Apple, so they understand spatial computing hardware. And maybe the timing is perfect -- LLM inference costs dropped enough in 2024-2025 to make always-available AI economically viable at consumer price points. I take this seriously. But even this bull case describes a consumer electronics accessory business, not a technology disruption. Apple could ship this functionality as an AirPods firmware update. Google could add it to Pixel Buds. Meta, having just acquired Limitless, is building exactly this into their hardware ecosystem. The structural problem is that Button is building a bridge into territory the platform owners can trivially annex. When I invested in Square, no bank wanted to serve micro-merchants -- the incumbents' cost structure made it impossible. Here, the incumbents are actively racing to serve the same users through devices those users already own.

The founding team raises the wrong kind of signal for my framework. Both Chris Nolet and Ryan Burgoyne are Apple insiders -- Staff and Senior Engineers on Vision Pro. That's exactly the pattern I flag: industry veterans applying their employer's playbook to a slightly different product. I prefer outsiders who don't know what the industry considers impossible, which frees them to attempt it. These founders know precisely what Apple considers possible in wearable hardware, and they've scoped their ambition accordingly. More concerning is the attention-split pattern: Nolet founded Vibe Code Go in YC S25 and Button Computer in YC W26 -- two different companies in consecutive YC batches, six months apart. The status of Vibe Code Go is unclear. When I backed Pat Brown or Peter Beck, these were people who had identified the problem they would spend a decade on. Serial-pivoting through accelerator batches suggests the founder hasn't found that problem yet. I look for obsession with a specific, massive problem -- not for founders shopping for the right product.

I pass on Button Computer. The company has done what I warn against most viscerally: it has optimized away every risk until the potential outcome no longer matters. A simpler device, a lower price point, a smaller ambition -- these are all strategies for surviving, not for transforming. Two smart people who could be working on problems that terrify them and matter are instead building a commodity Bluetooth accessory in a category that has already swallowed hundreds of millions of dollars. The technology creates no economic disruption. The timing is late, not early -- the exponential curve in LLM capability is real, but the wearable form factor is already crowded and the platform incumbents are arriving. Go find a problem too important not to work on.
