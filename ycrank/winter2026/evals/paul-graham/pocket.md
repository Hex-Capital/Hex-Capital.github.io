# Pocket -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is a tension that defines this entire company. Akshay Narisetti was building open-source AI note-taking hardware before it was a category. He was hacking microcontrollers to solve Rubik's cubes as a teenager, building autonomous drones, doing Google Summer of Code with self-driving cars. This is a genuine hardware hacker who arrived at the problem organically -- not someone who read about Plaud's $100M ARR and decided to compete. But here's the problem: by the time Pocket enters YC in Winter 2026, AI wearable note-taking isn't hiding in plain sight anymore. Meta acquired Limitless. Amazon acquired Bee. Plaud is printing money. The schlep that once made this category invisible has been thoroughly navigated by others. Narisetti was early to the insight, but the market caught up, and now he's entering a validated but crowded arena where the advantage of seeing what others don't has evaporated.

Narisetti himself is impressive in exactly the way I value. Fifty-nine GitHub repos. Rubik's cube-solving robots. Hacked Google's offline Dino game with a microcontroller and turned down multiple Google offers. Selected for the Harvard/MIT Augmentation Lab -- one of sixteen globally. He previously built "one of the world's largest open-source AI note-taking devices" and shipped hardware products used by thousands. This is the kind of builder who makes things because he genuinely cannot stop making things. If I were evaluating Narisetti alone on the "animal" test -- would I describe him as an animal at building hardware -- the answer is yes. He's twenty-three and has already shipped more physical products than most hardware founders twice his age.

What concerns me is the co-founder pairing. Narisetti studied computer science at SRM Institute in Chennai. Gabriel Dymowski studied at the University of Gdańsk and was previously CEO of DoxyChain, a blockchain document company. The dossier found no shared employer, no shared university, no obvious prior connection. I've seen this pattern too many times. In one YC batch, nine companies brought on co-founders they hadn't known long, and all nine came apart within a year. Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate -- the most important thing and the hardest to change. Dymowski has relevant startup experience (he raised €2.2M for DoxyChain, has Oracle and Accenture on his resume), but his background in blockchain document infrastructure doesn't obviously map onto consumer hardware with embedded AI. And he has no public GitHub presence, which means the technical load falls entirely on Narisetti. That's not inherently fatal -- but in hardware, where you're simultaneously debugging firmware, managing supply chain, and building AI pipelines, one technical founder stretched across all of it is a fragile configuration.

The traction picture is real but thin. Roughly 4,500 Google Play downloads with a 4.65-star rating is meaningful for pre-seed hardware -- actual humans bought a physical device and used it enough to leave reviews. But the Trustpilot data (3.5 stars, 21 reviews) tells a darker story: users reporting they received *another person's* meeting transcripts, HIPAA-sensitive data appearing translated into Korean via shared URLs, and refund disputes. For a product marketed as HIPAA-compliant -- which is supposed to be Pocket's differentiator against commodity alternatives -- data leakage is not a bug. It's an existential threat to the positioning. You cannot claim compliance with healthcare data regulations while accidentally routing transcripts between users. If I were advising these founders, I'd say fix this before anything else, because the HIPAA claim is either your moat or your liability, and right now it's trending toward liability.

The strongest bull case is this: Narisetti is a genuine hacker-builder who was in this space before it was hot, the $99 price point undercuts everyone, Meta and Amazon removing Limitless and Bee actually cleared the field of two competitors, and the hardware-software integration creates real switching costs that software-only alternatives can't match. If Pocket can nail quality and actually deliver on HIPAA compliance, there's a real wedge into healthcare and legal markets that Plaud hasn't pursued. And Narisetti's willingness to decline both Google offers and acquisition approaches shows the kind of determination I look for. The ceiling is high -- Plaud proved a bootstrapped hardware company can reach $100M ARR in this category. But the gap between "the ceiling is high" and "this team will reach it" is where most companies die. Pocket needs to compete against a $100M ARR incumbent with a team of six and $2K-$5K developer salaries, while simultaneously fixing data integrity issues that undermine their core differentiator. That's not one miracle -- it's at least two.

I keep coming back to the schlep question. The original insight -- that people need a physical device to passively capture conversations with AI processing -- was genuinely good, and Narisetti arrived at it organically. But schlep blindness only creates durable advantage when the schlep continues to repel competitors. Here, Plaud has already proven the model works and shown everyone exactly how to do it. The moat isn't the schlep anymore; it's execution against an entrenched leader while simultaneously competing with Big Tech's hardware ecosystems. Narisetti has the technical chops. The idea has organic roots. But the window where this was a hidden opportunity has closed, and what remains is a consumer hardware slugfight where capital and manufacturing scale matter enormously. I'd watch these founders -- Narisetti especially -- but this specific bet, in this specific market at this specific moment, doesn't clear my bar.
