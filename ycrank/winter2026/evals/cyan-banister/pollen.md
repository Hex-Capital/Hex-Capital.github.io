# Pollen -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me isn't the product or the market -- it's the pattern. Two YC batches, two completely different products, back to back. Daymi was a consumer AI clone for iMessage in Summer 2025. Pollen is B2B customer success AI in Winter 2026. The pivot happened, by Noah Yin's own words on LinkedIn, "the day after graduating UC Berkeley." When I see that kind of rapid domain-switching, I have to ask the question I always ask: is this founder solving a problem that's been eating at them for years, or are they searching for a market to attach their engineering skills to? I don't hear the biographical thread. Nobody on this team has ever been a customer success manager. Nobody woke up at 3am worried about churn risk at a SaaS company they were running. The pivot reads like smart young engineers doing what smart young engineers do -- iterating quickly toward product-market fit. That's not a bad thing in the abstract, but it's not how I invest.

If I could sit down with Noah, Aldrin, and Jeffrey and say "tell me your story -- not the business," I think I'd hear about Berkeley, about Amazon internships, about the student org Mobile Developers of Berkeley, about building Daymi and learning it wasn't going to work. All perfectly respectable. But I wouldn't hear the kind of survival story that tells me this person will run through walls for this specific problem when everything falls apart -- and everything always falls apart. My best investments have come from founders whose life experience made them uniquely equipped and uniquely committed to their particular problem. The Crusoe founders understood stranded gas from first principles. The Contraline founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone in venture would touch it. Here, I see three talented engineers who picked customer success because the market gap is real and the timing is good. That's necessary but not sufficient for me.

The category itself is the other concern. "AI agents for customer success" is about as consensus as it gets in 2026. Every incumbent -- Gainsight, Totango with Unison AI, ChurnZero, Vitally -- is bolting AI capabilities onto their platforms. Dozens of startups are building AI agents for every B2B workflow imaginable. This isn't the kind of opportunity that looks ridiculous to everyone else. It looks obvious. The most promising companies I've backed were ones that other investors actively dismissed -- private space was insane, ride-sharing was illegal, mining Bitcoin on gas flares was absurd. "Let's use AI to help customer success teams" is the kind of idea that every VC in San Francisco would nod along to, and that's precisely the signal that makes me cautious. When something is this popular, the differentiation has to come from extraordinary execution or a genuinely novel insight, and I don't see evidence of either yet.

The strongest case for Pollen is this: the mid-market CS segment is genuinely underserved, the incumbents are bloated and enterprise-focused, and an AI-native architecture that skips the dashboard-and-playbook approach could deliver faster time-to-value for companies still building their CS motion. The team's Amazon AWS GenAI experience is directly relevant -- Aldrin Ong introduced generative AI to an AWS search engine, which is real technical work. If these founders have the speed and taste to build something that feels magical to a VP of Customer Success at a 50-person SaaS company, they could carve out meaningful share before Vitally or ChurnZero catches up. YC taking them a second time is a genuine signal of founder quality. And the co-founder relationship -- three Berkeley CS classmates who already survived one pivot together -- is the one dimension where I see real positive signal. They know how they work together under stress, which matters.

But the bull case still doesn't activate my framework. This is an efficiency tool for existing SaaS businesses -- it doesn't create economic access for people who lack it, doesn't make an invisible power structure transparent, and doesn't operate in a space that's hard or stigmatized enough to build a real moat. The core technology stack -- LLM integration, CRM connectors, churn scoring -- is table stakes for any competent AI engineering team. Without domain expertise, without a biographical reason to persist when the market gets crowded and the incumbents start shipping faster, and without anything that feels genuinely weird or non-obvious about the approach, this sits outside what I look for with my own money.
