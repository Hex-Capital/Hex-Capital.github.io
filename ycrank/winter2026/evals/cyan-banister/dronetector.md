# DroneTector -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about DroneTector is that everybody wants to fund counter-drone right now. NATO has an accelerator for it. The UK Ministry of Defence is actively supporting it. Robin Radar just did €43 million in revenue. DroneShield posted $57.5 million. Axon acquired Dedrone. The market projections are enormous -- $10 billion by 2030 -- and every defense-focused investor I know is looking for counter-drone exposure. That's the problem, for me. I've learned over and over that the most promising companies are the ones that are not popular, that are difficult to assess, that make other investors uncomfortable. DroneTector operates in a space where the consensus has already formed. Nobody is going to tell you that detecting hostile drones is a crazy idea. Nobody is going to pass on this because it sounds insane. And in my experience, when a market is this validated, the returns get competed away and the weirdness -- the thing that creates asymmetric upside -- has already been priced in.

I do want to acknowledge what's genuinely impressive here, because the founder-technology fit is extraordinary. Dr. Matthew Moore didn't pivot to drones because the market is hot -- he spent years of his life doing PhD research on 94 GHz millimeter-wave radar specifically for detecting micro-Doppler signatures from small UAVs. His published, peer-reviewed work *is* the product. That kind of direct translation from deep research to company is rare, and it tells me the technical foundation is real. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I hear is an accomplished academic commercialization path. PhD at St Andrews, funded by EPSRC and QinetiQ, Royal Academy of Engineering fellowship, into YC. That's a well-supported institutional trajectory. I don't hear the survival story, the personal stake, the biographical thread that tells me this founder will keep going when the defense procurement cycle drags to month eighteen and there's no revenue and the board is getting nervous. I may be wrong about that -- I'd need to meet Matthew and hear his actual story. But from what I can see, the connection to this problem is intellectual mastery, not lived necessity.

The space where DroneTector genuinely excites me is regulatory and technical complexity. This reminds me of what drew me to Anduril -- defense procurement is a brutally hard market for startups. The qualification cycles, security clearances, compliance requirements, and long sales timelines create real barriers that keep most early-stage investors away. And DroneTector has already started navigating it: NATO DIANA participation, DASA support, QinetiQ connections from the PhD work. These are real credentialing signals in a space where credentialing takes years. The 94 GHz millimeter-wave approach also sits in genuinely specialized territory -- the components are different from lower-frequency radar, the antenna architectures are different, and the physics of nano-drone detection at these frequencies is not something Robin Radar or DroneShield can trivially replicate. If DroneTector can demonstrate that their approach catches the $50 nano drones that existing systems miss, that's a performance gap with real military urgency given what we're seeing in Ukraine.

Here's the bull case I genuinely wrestled with: if the drone threat continues escalating -- and every signal says it will -- defense budgets will increasingly flow to whoever can detect the smallest, cheapest drones. The existing players may have scale, but they're built around RF sensing or lower-frequency radar that wasn't designed for this threat class. DroneTector could be right that 94 GHz is the only physics that works for nano-drone detection, in which case the PhD-level IP becomes a real moat. NATO and MoD support could compress the procurement timeline. And the UK defense tech ecosystem is less crowded than the US, potentially giving them more favorable deal dynamics. If all of that comes together, this could be the company that defense ministries across the West standardize on for the hardest detection problem.

But I keep coming back to the team dynamics. Three people, all freshly out of PhD programs, and the CTO -- Dr. Doherty -- is also listed as Co-founder and CEO of Quantum Fabrix. On a three-person team building radar hardware for defense customers, I need every founder fully committed. I watched HQ Trivia collapse because of founder dynamics that were visible before I invested, and I promised myself I'd never ignore that signal again. A co-founder with a concurrent venture is exactly the kind of divided attention that becomes catastrophic when the company hits its first real crisis -- and in defense hardware, that crisis is coming. I also don't see evidence of how these three handle disagreement. They share institutional affiliations and fellowships, which is nice, but proximity isn't the same as tested resilience.

This is a well-credentialed team attacking a real problem in a growing market, and I respect the technical depth. But it doesn't activate my framework. The market is consensus, not contrarian. The founders are accomplished but not outsiders. The impact is institutional security, not economic access for people who lack it. And the team has a structural question mark I can't ignore. For a defense-focused fund, this is probably a strong bet. For me, investing my own money, I need to feel that jolt -- that sense of backing someone doing something the world thinks is crazy, solving a problem that's woven into their own story. I don't feel it here.
