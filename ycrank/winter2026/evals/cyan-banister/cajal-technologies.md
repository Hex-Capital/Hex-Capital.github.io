# Cajal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Cajal is not the product or the market — it's how popular this space has become. AI-powered formal verification and mathematical reasoning is attracting enormous capital right now: Harmonic AI at a $1.45 billion valuation, Axiom Math at $300 million, Google DeepMind building AlphaProof internally, DeepSeek releasing open-source Lean4 provers. When I see that kind of capital flooding into a category, my instinct is to walk the other direction. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. Cajal is entering a category that has already become legible and exciting to consensus investors, and that's precisely the signal that makes me cautious. The applied science angle — targeting quantum computing and finance rather than competition math — does provide some differentiation, but the underlying bet on "AI + Lean + formal proofs" is no longer weird. It's becoming a thesis you could pitch at any Sand Hill Road firm and get a knowing nod.

If I could sit down with Luke and Pedro, I'd ask them the question I always ask: tell me your story. Not the product. Not Lean 4. How did you get here? What's the biographical thread that connects you — specifically you — to formal mathematical verification? And from everything publicly available, I cannot find that thread. Luke has ML and neuroscience research from Oxford, Cambridge, and UCL — impressive institutional credentials, but those are stamps of academic excellence, not a story of someone who was broken by a problem and couldn't let it go. Pedro is a computer science student who co-founded Vertebra — a company focused on aptamers for disease detection — which is an entirely different domain. They met at Entrepreneurs First in a castle in Germany. There's nothing in the public record connecting either founder to formal methods, to the Lean ecosystem, to theorem proving, or to the specific pain of working in quantum computing or finance and discovering that informal reasoning fails you. Maybe that story exists and just isn't visible. But my entire evaluation method depends on hearing it, and I can't hear it here.

The economic access dimension is where this falls furthest outside my framework. When I backed Uber, I saw a world where drivers — regular people — could create income on their own terms. When I invested in Affirm, it was about transparent credit for people who'd been exploited by hidden fees. With Cajal, the initial customers are quantum computing research labs and quantitative finance firms — some of the most well-resourced, elite institutions on the planet. Formally verified proofs for hedge fund algorithms is not poverty alleviation. I'm not saying it has no value — correctness guarantees in safety-critical systems could eventually ripple outward to benefit everyone — but that's a long chain of inference, and at the early stage I invest based on who benefits directly from this product today. The answer here is institutions that already have abundant resources.

I want to give the bull case its due, because I've been wrong before about companies I initially passed on. Here's what would have to be true for Cajal to be a great investment: Luke and Pedro have deep, undocumented expertise in formal verification that simply doesn't show up in public sources. The Entrepreneurs First program surfaced something extraordinary about their complementary skills. The applied-domain focus is a genuinely vacant wedge — Harmonic is obsessed with IMO gold medals, Axiom is building general-purpose quant tools, and nobody is building the domain-specific formalization libraries that quantum computing and aerospace teams desperately need. If Cajal can build those libraries first, the switching costs become immense — you don't swap out your formally verified proof infrastructure the way you swap SaaS tools. And the "why now" is real: Lean 4's maturity and LLM capabilities crossing a reasoning threshold do create a genuine window. If all of this were true, and if the founders had a personal stake I simply couldn't see from the outside, I could imagine this becoming deeply important. But I'd need to hear that story directly.

The co-founder dynamic gives me pause in a specific way. They met through a structured matching program, not through years of shared work or a crisis they navigated together. My HQ Trivia experience taught me that co-founder alignment isn't something you can evaluate on paper — it reveals itself under pressure. Pedro's prior startup lasted about two years, which tells me he's been through one cycle, but I don't know what that experience forged. EF-matched co-founders can absolutely work, but I've learned to probe harder when the relationship doesn't have organic roots. The competitive landscape amplifies this concern: when Harmonic and Axiom are operating with hundreds of millions in capital, Cajal's two-person team will face sustained pressure that tests co-founder bonds in ways that a castle workshop cannot simulate.

I'm passing on this one. Not because formal verification isn't important — it is. Not because these founders aren't smart — they clearly are. But because nothing in this company activates the signals I've trained myself to trust over 130+ investments. I don't feel the biographical thread tying these founders to this problem. The space isn't weird or unpopular anymore. The people who benefit first are already privileged. And I can't evaluate co-founder resilience that hasn't been stress-tested. Sometimes the right answer is simply: this isn't my kind of bet.
