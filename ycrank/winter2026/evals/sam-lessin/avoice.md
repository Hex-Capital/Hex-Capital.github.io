# Avoice -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Avoice is the exact company my framework is designed to filter out. An AI-powered documentation workspace for architects — built entirely on LLM capabilities, sold as vertical SaaS, with no physical operations underneath it. My test is brutally simple: would this business exist if AI didn't exist? The answer is no. The AI isn't a cherry on top of a functioning business; the AI is the entire sundae. Strip away the language model and you have... a document management system? That's not a company. That's a feature Autodesk will ship inside Revit within eighteen months and bundle for free to protect their existing $11 billion AEC empire. The winner of the AI race in any vertical depends on who already owns distribution, and Autodesk owns this distribution so thoroughly that competing against them with a standalone AI tool is bringing a knife to a gunfight where the other guy also has a tank.

The founder-idea pairing fails my primary filter in both directions. Neither Chawin nor Chawit Asavasaetakul has any documented experience in architecture, construction, AEC software, building codes, or specification standards. They're clearly intelligent — Stanford MS&E, competitive chess at National Master level, prior startup experience with WeStride in EdTech. But "sane" in my framework means domain-credible for the specific idea you're pursuing. Brian Armstrong understood financial infrastructure before building Coinbase. The Teamshares founders understood small business operations before trying to buy hundreds of them. These founders built an EdTech platform and a food surplus app, then decided to tackle architectural documentation — a domain requiring intimate knowledge of CSI MasterFormat, coordination workflows, professional liability, and the deeply specific ways architects actually produce construction documents. Smart generalists applying AI to a vertical they don't come from is not "sane person, insane idea." It's "smart person, obvious idea in someone else's domain." And the idea itself is consensus — four well-funded competitors already exist in adjacent spaces, and "AI helps with document processing" surprises precisely no one.

The structural moat question is where this completely falls apart for me. The dossier's defensibility argument rests on "firm-specific knowledge accumulation" — the idea that as architecture firms use Studio Library, their practice standards and past project data create switching costs. I've heard this exact argument from every vertical SaaS company I've ever evaluated. It's the same claim Birchbox made about customer preference data compounding into lock-in. It didn't. The reality is that LLM document understanding is a commodity capability. Every architecture firm's knowledge base is a collection of PDFs, specifications, and drawing standards that any competent AI system can ingest. There's no network effect here — Firm A using Avoice doesn't make Firm B's experience better. There's no physical infrastructure creating operational complexity. There's no protocol layer that other software builds on. The moat is "we ingested your documents first," which is a switching cost, not a moat, and a weak one at that.

The bull case, which I want to engage with honestly: if Avoice could become the knowledge primitive for how architecture firms store, retrieve, and compound their institutional knowledge — something like what Airtable became for non-technical databases — then the "application vs. protocol" distinction shifts. My Airtable exception proves I'm willing to see SaaS tools that become new primitives. The Studio Library concept, if it evolved into a standard that other AEC tools integrated with, could theoretically create ecosystem lock-in. Architecture firms hemorrhage institutional knowledge when senior partners retire, and a system that genuinely preserves and operationalizes decades of practice wisdom would be extraordinarily sticky. The $25K annual productivity gain per user claim, if real, would make this a no-brainer purchase. But for this bull case to work, you'd need founders who deeply understand how architectural knowledge actually flows and compounds within firms — who have lived inside that workflow for years. Everything in the dossier suggests these founders are building from the outside looking in, and the gap between "AI can process architectural documents" and "AI can become the institutional memory of an architecture practice" is enormous and domain-specific.

The narrow vertical compounds my concerns. Architecture firms are a specialized, conservative customer segment with long procurement cycles. The narrative can stretch to broader AEC — engineering firms, construction companies — but each expansion requires rebuilding domain-specific knowledge for a different profession's documentation standards. This isn't an infinity story that naturally expands. It's a vertical tool that would need to conquer adjacent verticals one by one, each requiring deep domain expertise the team hasn't demonstrated. Compare this to Solana's narrative, which expanded from "fast blockchain" to "entire decentralized computing infrastructure" — each milestone made the next expansion more credible. Avoice's narrative narrows as you examine it rather than expanding.

I'd rather fund an architecture firm that uses AI to coordinate documentation better than its competitors — a Craftwork-style play where the moat is operational excellence in delivering architectural services, with technology as the amplifier — than a technology company selling AI features to architecture firms. The former gets stronger as AI gets cheaper. The latter gets weaker. That distinction is the entire thesis, and Avoice is on the wrong side of it.
