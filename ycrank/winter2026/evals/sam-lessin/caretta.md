# Caretta -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is the company I describe when I talk about the investments I don't make. Real-time AI for sales calls is not an insane idea -- it's the single most obvious application of large language models to a known enterprise workflow. Every VC who's spent fifteen minutes with ChatGPT has thought "this should whisper answers to salespeople during calls." When the idea is that legible, you don't have a non-consensus bet -- you have a feature request that Gong's product team has already roadmapped. And Gong has $584 million in funding, $250 million in ARR, and deep relationships with every serious revenue org on the planet. The founders here are three TU Delft CS graduates with no identifiable experience in B2B sales, revenue operations, or enterprise go-to-market. That's not "sane person, insane idea." That's a technically capable team chasing the most consensus AI application in the most competitive category with no domain-specific credibility to navigate it.

My framework has one filter that kills this immediately: would this business exist if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. Caretta is not a business that AI makes better -- AI IS the business. Their public GitHub repository is a FastAPI wrapper around NVIDIA's Parakeet transcription model. The core stack -- speech-to-text, retrieval-augmented generation, real-time LLM inference -- is available to anyone with an API key. This is the opposite of Craftwork, where you need actual painters showing up to actual houses and the software just makes the dispatch more efficient. Caretta has no physical operation, no regulatory position, no protocol layer, no proprietary data at the company level. The "compounding knowledge base" per customer is the most defensible thing they've articulated, and it's a weak version of the argument Birchbox made about customer preference data -- it sounds like lock-in until a competitor offers a migration tool and your knowledge base ports over in an afternoon.

The bull case, which I'll steelman: real-time inference during a live sales call is genuinely harder than post-call analytics. The latency constraints, the need for live audio processing plus instantaneous knowledge retrieval, the integration with actual call infrastructure -- this is a non-trivial engineering challenge. If Caretta can ship a product that genuinely works well in the live moment while Gong is still optimizing for after-the-fact coaching, there's a window. The timing argument is real -- low-latency LLMs and production-quality RAG hitting simultaneously in 2024-2025 creates technical feasibility that didn't exist two years ago. And the Slack-native post-call workflow is a smart distribution wedge for SMB sales teams who find Gong's enterprise platform too heavy. If the founders have unusual execution speed and can accumulate customers before incumbents ship competitive real-time features, there's a path. But that path requires winning a footrace against teams with hundreds of engineers and billions in resources, run by founders who've never sold to sales leaders. The timing window for a commodity-stack startup to outrun a well-funded incumbent in their own market is measured in months, not years.

The pivot from VoysAI (recruitment screening and call practice) to Caretta (live call intelligence) within six to eight months of their first product launch tells me the team iterates fast but hasn't yet found a problem they understand deeply enough to commit to. Pivoting is fine -- I'm not allergic to it. But the pivot was from one AI-for-calls application to another AI-for-calls application, not toward something structurally different. They're searching within the same consensus category rather than discovering a non-obvious angle. The team met at university, which is better than meeting at a co-founder matching event, but there's no signal that any of these founders have spent meaningful time inside the sales organizations they're building for. When your target buyer is a VP of Sales and none of your founders have ever carried a quota or managed a pipeline, you're building from the outside in -- and enterprise buyers smell that immediately.

There is nothing here that creates a new primitive. Caretta is an application built entirely on other people's infrastructure -- NVIDIA's models, commercial LLM APIs, existing telephony systems. Nothing compounds across customers. No other businesses become better because Caretta exists. The "infinity story" would need to be something like "we become the organizational knowledge layer that powers all business communication" -- but that narrative is shared by Microsoft Copilot, Salesforce Einstein, and every other AI incumbent with actual distribution. The narrative ceiling is capped by the competitive structure, not by the team's ambition. I'm passing.
