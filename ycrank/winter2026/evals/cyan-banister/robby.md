# Robby -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumped out at me before anything else: Netic has raised $43 million at a $450 million valuation with Founders Fund and Greylock behind it, growing revenue 1,700% in under a year, attacking the same home services revenue optimization problem. Housecall Pro shipped "CSR AI" and "Coach AI" features last fall. ServiceTitan just IPO'd at an $8.45 billion market cap with a war chest to build or buy whatever it wants. Arch has Coatue and Floodgate money for AI-driven outbound in home services. When I see a category this crowded with capital and attention, every instinct I've developed over 130+ investments tells me the weirdness has been arbitraged away. The most promising companies are not popular. This category is very popular right now.

When I sit down with founders, I don't want to hear the business first -- I want to hear how they got here, the thread that makes this problem theirs. With Robby, what I see is three Harvard Business School classmates who pivoted from a customs and imports AI platform after tariff policy shifted, then systematically "evaluated multiple industries before landing on home services." Joe's Bain consulting work gave them the analytical lens on the PE-backed HVAC market. That's a perfectly rational way to choose a market, and I respect the rigor, but it's not the signal I invest on. When I backed Travis at Uber, my husband and I had spent years fuming about the medallion system -- the frustration was personal and deep before it was a business thesis. When I championed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research that others ignored because the problem was his life's work. Here, the domain connection was manufactured through a deliberate process of ride-alongs and shadowing office positions over months. I give them genuine credit for that -- pursuing EPA 608 certification is not something most AI founders would ever think to do, and it shows a seriousness about the craft that's rare. But acquired domain expertise and biographical conviction are different animals. I don't feel that inseparable link between who these founders are and why this problem exists.

The strongest bull case deserves a real hearing, because there are things here I'd want to be wrong about. Nine named paying customers at pre-seed with testimonials claiming six figures in weekly revenue opportunities and $40K closed on launch day -- that's not hand-waving, that's real signal. Joe's PE consulting network could be a distribution weapon: if PE firms rolling up HVAC portfolios mandate Robby across their acquisitions, that's a scalable channel that Netic and Arch don't have. The specific wedge of in-field technician enablement -- giving the person standing in your home real-time context about your equipment, your history, your likelihood to buy -- is genuinely differentiated from Netic's autonomous calls and Arch's outbound marketing. There's a version of this where the compounding data loop from thousands of documented visits creates something defensible that looks obvious in hindsight. And the labor shortage in home services is real -- extracting more revenue per visit instead of hiring more bodies is a structural tailwind. If I were a consensus-oriented investor evaluating execution quality and market timing, this team would score well.

But I'm not a consensus-oriented investor. The economic access dimension is present but points sideways from what I look for. Robby helps HVAC business owners capture more revenue from existing customers. That's genuinely useful, and there's an indirect benefit to technicians who perform better with better tools. But this isn't creating income for people who didn't have it before, the way Uber did for drivers or Postmates did for delivery workers. It's optimizing existing revenue flows for established businesses. The invisible system being made visible here -- unrealized upsell opportunities, incomplete documentation -- is a real business pain point, but it's not the kind of opacity that locks people out of economic participation.

The platform dependency risk also triggers something in me from my IronPort days. Building a revenue-optimization layer on top of ServiceTitan's ecosystem when ServiceTitan is now a public company with the resources to absorb this exact functionality -- that's a precarious position. It's not a regulated or stigmatized space where the complexity itself becomes a moat. Nobody is afraid to build AI for HVAC. There's no FDA pathway to navigate, no defense procurement maze, no social stigma keeping competitors out. The barrier to entry is domain knowledge, which can be acquired -- these founders proved that themselves.

The co-founder dynamics are actually the brightest spot for my framework. Feroze and Joe previously built Lifelong Health together. Vineet and Feroze were Pearce Fellows together at Underscore VC. These aren't strangers who met at a co-founder matching event -- they have overlapping working relationships and weathered a pivot together. That matters to me deeply after watching HQ Trivia implode. But strong co-founder alignment can't override the absence of biographical conviction and the consensus nature of the category. This is a well-assembled team chasing a well-understood opportunity, and that's exactly the kind of bet I leave for other investors.
