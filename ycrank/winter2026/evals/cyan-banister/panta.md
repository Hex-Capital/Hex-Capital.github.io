# Panta -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately about Panta: there are at least five YC-backed companies chasing AI-powered commercial insurance brokerage right now, and one of them -- Harper, from the batch before this one -- is already reporting $2.3 million in revenue with a 25-person team. When I see a category this crowded in YC alone, it tells me the consensus has already formed. The most promising companies I've backed were not popular. They were difficult to assess. Crusoe Energy mining Bitcoin on gas flares, SpaceX building rockets in a hangar -- nobody else wanted in. "AI replaces insurance brokers" is the opposite of that. Every VC I know is salivating over AI agent companies right now, and insurance automation is near the top of the list. That's a signal I've learned to pay close attention to, and it doesn't work in Panta's favor.

The thing I can't get past is that I don't know these founders' stories. Not the business story -- I mean the actual human story. Why insurance? How does a Google ML engineer working on recommendation models at Vertex AI and an Apple full-stack engineer end up passionate about surplus lines brokerage for construction companies? Maybe there's a deeply personal answer to that question, but nothing in the record suggests one. When I backed Uber, it wasn't because I analyzed the taxi market -- it was because my husband and I had spent years talking about what a racket the medallion system was, and when I met Travis, his gravitas made it obvious he was going to tear it down. When I invested in Contraline, it was because the founder had spent years in academic research that nobody cared about, solving a problem rooted in his own intellectual obsession. With Panta, what I see are two very talented engineers who identified a large, inefficient market. That's not nothing. But it's not the biographical signal I depend on to separate the founders who will persist through years of regulatory nightmares and carrier resistance from the ones who will pivot when the going gets brutal.

Now, I want to be honest about what's genuinely compelling here, because there is real signal if I look through a different lens. The explosive materials underwriting demo caught my attention -- taking a 70-page chemistry document for oil and gas explosive materials coverage and automating what usually takes three weeks of human review down to minutes. That's not a toy demo on simple business owner's policies. That's walking into the hardest, scariest corner of specialty insurance and showing you can handle it. The 50-state surplus lines licensing is real regulatory work, not a checkbox. And the focus on heavy industry -- construction, logistics, manufacturing, agriculture -- with Spanish language support? That's serving the economic backbone of this country, the people who actually build things and move things and grow things. If I squint, I can see the Affirm pattern here: making an opaque, gatekept system accessible to people who are currently underserved by it. Small construction firms waiting weeks for coverage can't bid on jobs. Trucking companies without proper insurance can't put drivers on the road. If Panta genuinely collapses that timeline from weeks to minutes for these businesses, they're unlocking real economic activity for working-class industries. That matters to me.

The regulatory complexity dimension is where Panta actually scores well against my framework. Insurance is one of those spaces that scares away most early-stage investors and most founders. The E&O liability, the state-by-state licensing requirements, the carrier relationship management -- this is genuinely hard, and hard spaces create moats for the people who figure them out. I invested in Contraline partly because the FDA pathway was so daunting that it kept competitors away. Panta's willingness to take on direct brokerage liability rather than hiding behind a SaaS layer, and to demonstrate capability on explosive materials rather than simple BOP policies, shows real courage in their approach. But courage in a crowded field is different from courage in an empty one.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? Harper would need to stumble -- maybe their more general SMB approach turns out to be a disadvantage in complex specialty lines where Panta's heavy-industry focus gives them a real edge. The founders would need to have a depth of commitment to this problem that isn't visible in the public record. And the AI commoditization risk would need to be offset by the proprietary underwriting data they accumulate on hard-to-place specialty risks -- a data moat that compounds with every explosive materials policy and complex construction liability they process. If all that breaks right, Panta could be the specialty commercial insurance platform for the industries that actually need it most, while generalist competitors fight over easier, lower-margin SMB business. I can see the path. But I don't feel the jolt. The founders are technically excellent, the market is real, and the regulatory navigation is impressive -- but this feels like a well-executed opportunity analysis, not a mission born from lived experience. And in a category where the consensus has already formed and a direct competitor has a meaningful head start, I need that extra signal of founder obsession to believe these are the specific people who will outlast everyone else in a long, grinding fight.
