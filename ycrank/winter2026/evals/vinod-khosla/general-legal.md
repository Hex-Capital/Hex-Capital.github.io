# General Legal -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a team that built and sold one of the most important legal AI companies in history — Casetext, $650 million to Thomson Reuters — and then came back to build... a law firm that charges $500 per contract review. The CTO who engineered a $650M exit, two Harvard Law JDs from Cooley and Fenwick & West, published ML researchers with transformer-based legal retrieval papers — and the ambition they've calibrated to is making commercial contracts 75% cheaper for growth-stage startups. These are people capable of attempting something that terrifies the legal industry. Instead, they've chosen something the legal industry would yawn at.

Let me be direct about consequence magnitude. If General Legal succeeds completely — dominates commercial contract review for growth-stage startups — what changes in the world? Founders save a few thousand dollars per contract and get faster turnaround. That's a real value proposition. It's also, by my framework, entirely inconsequential. The $1.12 trillion legal services market continues operating exactly as it does today. BigLaw still handles M&A, IPOs, and litigation on hourly billing. Courts still function identically. Access to justice for billions of underserved people doesn't improve. The consequence of total success here is a profitable professional services firm — not a transformed industry. They've reduced their probability of failure by scoping narrowly, and in doing so, they've made the outcome of success a modest business in a well-served niche.

What concerns me more is the insider dynamic. Every pattern I've seen in my career says that the greatest disruptions come from outsiders who don't know what the experts consider impossible. Pat Brown didn't know the food industry's constraints. Peter Beck didn't know aerospace's rules. These founders know legal services intimately — two Harvard Law JDs, years at top VC law firms, deep inside Casetext and Thomson Reuters. They know exactly what's possible and what isn't, which is why they've scoped their ambition to fit within the existing system. They're not trying to eliminate attorneys from the loop — they ARE attorneys, running a licensed law firm. The regulatory moat they tout is simultaneously their ceiling: every contract requires attorney oversight, which means they can never achieve software-like marginal economics. They're optimizing a process, not disrupting a system.

The strongest bull case would require believing that $500 contract reviews are a wedge into something much larger — that General Legal becomes the AI-native law firm that replaces traditional firms across all practice areas, the way Square's mobile card reader was a wedge into a comprehensive financial services platform. And the team clearly has the capability to execute such an expansion. But there are two problems with this analogy. First, Square worked because payments are software — zero marginal cost at scale. General Legal requires a U.S.-barred attorney signing off on every deliverable, which creates linear scaling constraints that software companies don't face. Second, the dossier shows no evidence of this broader ambition. The positioning is explicitly "$500 commercial contracts for growth-stage startups." If the founders have a vision for transforming how the trillion-dollar legal industry operates, they haven't articulated it publicly. I'd need to hear them describe how this approach makes the entire hourly-billing model structurally obsolete across practice areas — not just cheaper in one narrow segment.

I'll credit what deserves credit: the timing is genuinely favorable. LLM capabilities for legal text understanding crossed a critical threshold in 2023-2024, the ALSP market is growing at 18% CAGR, and legal tech attracted $6 billion in 2025. The team is positioned ahead of the curve — they built the AI that became Thomson Reuters' CoCounsel, so they understand the technology trajectory better than almost anyone. And the team itself is superbly constructed for this specific venture: practicing attorneys who are also ML researchers, with years of working together and a shared $650M exit. If I were evaluating team quality and timing alone, this would score well. But I don't evaluate those in isolation. The question is always: team quality and timing *in service of what consequence?*

The AI tooling commoditization risk amplifies my concern. The underlying LLMs are broadly available. Any attorney can adopt similar workflows — and competitors like Lawhive ($100M raised, $35M revenue, expanding to the U.S.) are already building the same hybrid model with far more capital. The technical moat from Casetext is real but narrow: it's workflow design expertise, not defensible IP. When multiple YC W26 batchmates (LegalOS, Arcline) are pursuing adjacent "AI + attorneys" models in the same cohort, the approach is clearly consensus, not contrarian. And when incumbents could validate rather than dismiss your approach, you're not disrupting — you're iterating.

I pass. These founders are too talented for a problem this contained. I'd tell them what I tell every impressive team chasing an incremental improvement: you're capable of something that would make the entire legal profession rethink how it operates. A $500 contract review isn't that. Go find the version of this that experts would call impossible — maybe it's eliminating the attorney requirement entirely through a new regulatory framework, or making legal services accessible to the four billion people worldwide who have no access to any attorney at any price. Attack the system, don't optimize within it.
