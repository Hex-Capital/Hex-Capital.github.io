# Ishiki Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here are two founders who spent years inside Meta's Reality Labs building multimodal AI for smart glasses -- one of the most genuinely transformational platforms in development, a device that mediates your entire sensory experience of the world -- and they left to build a meeting bot. That mismatch between founder caliber and problem scale is the first thing I notice and the thing that concerns me most. Amit Yadav has a PhD, twenty-plus publications at CVPR and NeurIPS, and trained multimodal LLMs on the LLaMA team. Robert Xu spent four years optimizing real-time inference on Orion AR glasses at latencies that push physics. These are elite technical minds. And they're pointing all of that firepower at making Zoom calls less annoying.

Let me start where I always start: if Ishiki Labs succeeds completely -- if Fern becomes the dominant real-time meeting copilot with perfect social awareness -- what changes? Professionals get a smoother meeting experience. Sales reps get real-time coaching. Executives get instant task delegation without awkward bot interruptions. That's a good product. Maybe it captures meaningful share of a $34 billion market by 2035. But nobody's life fundamentally transforms. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. Meetings still happen the same way, on the same platforms, between the same people. The consequence of success is a successful B2B SaaS company in a crowded category where Otter.ai already runs at $100 million ARR and Fireflies just hit a billion-dollar valuation. I've seen this pattern hundreds of times -- strong team, real market, working technology, and I stop right there because if it all works, so what?

What triggers my pattern recognition even more is the founder profile. Both Amit and Robert are deep insiders -- not outsiders challenging what the industry considers impossible, but experts commercializing exactly what they built at their previous employer. My best investments have come from people who didn't know what the incumbents considered impossible: Peter Beck in Rocket Lab didn't come from aerospace, Pat Brown didn't come from the food industry. The outsider's advantage is that they attempt things the experts have ruled out. Ishiki Labs isn't attempting something experts dismissed -- they're experts applying established knowledge to an established product category. That's the opposite of the signal I look for. When I say experience creates "a set of biases that prevent you from inventing," this is what I mean: these founders know precisely what's buildable because they built it at Meta. That knowledge makes execution smoother but constrains the ambition to what's already proven feasible.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. If "social awareness" in AI turns out to be a foundational capability -- not just for meetings but for every AI assistant in every context (cars, homes, hospitals, glasses) -- then Ishiki Labs could be building the engine, not the feature. The meeting product becomes the wedge into a platform play. And the timing is legitimately interesting: foundation models just crossed the latency threshold for real-time multimodal interaction in 2024 with GPT-4o and Gemini Live, which means the enabling infrastructure arrived roughly twelve months ago. Ishiki Labs is positioned at a real inflection point in what AI can do in real time. If social awareness proves as difficult as it might be -- requiring proprietary training data from millions of real meeting interactions, nuanced cultural understanding, personality-specific calibration -- then the data flywheel could create genuine defensibility. That's a version of this company I'd find compelling. But nothing in the dossier suggests that's the ambition. The positioning is squarely "meeting copilot," not "social intelligence platform." And the dossier's own risk analysis identifies the core problem: the differentiation surface is narrow. "Knowing when to stay silent" is a single feature dimension. If Zoom or Teams ships a toggle that says "listen-only mode with contextual suggestions," the perceived gap evaporates.

The competitive dynamics here are what ultimately make this a pass for me. This isn't Juniper challenging Cisco when "no major telecom wanted TCP/IP" and Cisco's CTO said they'd never build it. This is a two-person team entering a market where four competitors have raised a combined $237 million, where Microsoft Copilot already provides real-time meeting assistance inside Teams, and where the platform owners -- Zoom, Google, Microsoft -- have every incentive and capability to add social awareness natively at zero marginal cost to their captive user bases. The technology layer Ishiki Labs differentiates on -- speech recognition, language understanding, voice synthesis, conversational timing -- is increasingly commoditized through foundation model APIs. When the moat is execution speed against competitors with hundred-million-dollar war chests and tens of millions of existing users, that's not the asymmetric bet I structure my portfolio around. My option-value framework says the money either expires or you build something transformational. This company's success case is a solid business, not a redefined industry -- and that's the outcome I find least interesting.
