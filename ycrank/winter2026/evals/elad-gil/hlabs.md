# Hlabs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment here is real but fragile -- and that distinction matters. In 2025, 145% tariffs on Chinese imports nearly tripled the landed cost of a Chinese humanoid robot in the U.S., from $16K to roughly $40K. Simultaneously, robotics startups raised over $2.26 billion in Q1 2026 alone, and the CHIPS Act is accelerating domestic electronics manufacturing. That convergence -- tariff-driven cost inflation on imports, record venture funding into robotics, and federal reshoring incentives -- creates a specific window for a U.S.-based robotics component supplier. HLabs is positioning itself squarely in that window. The question I keep returning to: is this an Anduril-style structural vacancy, or is it a tariff arbitrage that unwinds with the next trade negotiation? When I invested in Anduril, the moat was ITAR compliance and defense procurement barriers -- multi-year structural obstacles that don't reverse with an executive order. Tariffs are policy, not regulation. They can change in a single news cycle. The defense customer segment HLabs serves does benefit from ITAR-driven supply chain requirements, which are permanent. But defense appears to be one of several customer categories, not the primary wedge. If the company were organized entirely around defense supply chain provenance, I'd be significantly more bullish.

What catches my attention is that this fits the "boring but critical" infrastructure pattern I've seen generate outsized returns repeatedly. Actuator control boards at $35 per unit -- nobody gets excited about this at a demo day. It's the PagerDuty of robotics: every team building a robot needs motor control, but nobody's pitching motor control as a category-defining opportunity. Most investors systematically overlook this type of bet. The incumbents -- Parker Hannifin, Bosch Rexroth -- serve large-scale industrial automation and are structurally misaligned with early-stage robotics startups needing low-volume, developer-friendly components. That's the business model cannibalization dynamic I look for: the incumbent can't serve this customer without cannibalizing their existing sales channels and pricing structure. And the competition (ODrive, moteus, HEBI Robotics) is fragmented, underfunded, and mostly single-product. Nobody is building the integrated supply chain.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is the most compelling structural argument for HLabs. Control boards today, Nvidia Jetson main boards and camera systems in Q1 2026, wireless modules after that. If HLabs becomes the default component supplier for U.S. robotics startups, each new product line distributes through existing customer relationships -- the same motion that made Stripe's payment API a distribution channel for Atlas and Treasury. The open-source firmware is a smart developer acquisition funnel that creates switching costs through firmware familiarity and integration depth. Forty-plus robotics companies ordering within four months of first product launch suggests the distribution channel is already forming. That said, hardware distribution doesn't compound the way software distribution does. Every new product requires new manufacturing, new supply chain management, new quality assurance. The expansion economics are fundamentally different from adding an API endpoint.

The bull case I want to take seriously: even if tariffs moderate, domestic manufacturing preference is a bipartisan trend that's unlikely to fully reverse. The robotics adoption curve is genuinely inflecting -- AI capabilities are making robots useful in warehouses, homes, and defense applications in ways that weren't feasible three years ago. Component suppliers historically capture durable value during technology buildouts regardless of which end applications win. And 40+ company orders in four months, as a solo founder shipping physical hardware, is genuinely impressive execution velocity. If Hetherington can recruit a small, strong team through YC and expand the product line as planned, this could become the default domestic supply chain for an entire category.

But I can't get past three concerns. First, the tariff dependency introduces binary political risk into what should be a technology thesis. Second, Hetherington is a solo founder building hardware at scale -- PCB design, firmware, manufacturing, supply chain, QA, sales, and customer support all falling on one person, with an ambitious Q1 2026 roadmap expanding to four-plus product lines. Hardware companies are not software companies; you can't iterate your way out of a manufacturing quality problem. His prior company Mystic AI ran for six years and appears to have wound down without a clear exit, which isn't disqualifying but makes execution pattern a fair question. Third, the open-source firmware means the software layer provides community and adoption benefits but no proprietary moat -- defensibility has to come entirely from manufacturing execution and ecosystem breadth, which are capital-intensive advantages to build. The single miracle here is "build a competitive U.S. manufacturing supply chain for robotics components" -- but that's actually multiple miracles: achieve manufacturing cost parity, expand the product line, build distribution, and maintain quality at volume. Hardware companies inherently face more sequential challenges than software companies, and that compounds risk in exactly the way my single-miracle framework is designed to flag.

This is a company I'd track closely. The market archetype is right -- boring, infrastructure-layer, overlooked by most investors. The timing is directionally correct. The product-to-distribution concept is sound. But the moat needs to be structural, not political, and the execution challenge of scaling hardware as a solo founder with an open-source software layer is a high bar. I'd want to see a co-founder with manufacturing operations experience, a defense-first GTM strategy that leverages ITAR as the permanent moat rather than tariffs as the temporary one, and evidence that the product line expansion doesn't require multiple sequential miracles.
