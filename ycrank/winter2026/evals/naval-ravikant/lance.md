# Lance -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive dynamics here tell the story before anything else. Canary Technologies has $180M+ in funding, a $600M valuation, thousands of hotel relationships, and shipped AI Voice in 2025. Duve raised $85M. Lance is entering a market where the consensus has already formed -- "hotels need AI" is on every industry conference slide deck -- and where well-capitalized incumbents are executing on that consensus. This is exactly the structure I warn against: when twenty investors are already funding your competitors, the asymmetric upside has been priced out of the category. The question isn't whether AI will transform hospitality operations. Everyone agrees it will. The question is whether Lance has something that can't be replicated by Canary adding one more module to their platform.

The specific knowledge test is where this falls short for me. Caleb Chan built voice and AI agent technology at Google and Salesforce -- that's institutional experience, valuable but fundamentally teachable. Any strong ML engineer who spent two years at those companies would acquire similar capabilities. Gatik Trivedi has genuine technical depth -- Stanford speech research, agent infrastructure work, a prior exit -- but again, this is AI expertise, not hospitality expertise. None of these founders appear to have lived inside hotel operations, managed a front desk, or spent years understanding why legacy PMS systems work the way they do. They're an AI team that selected hospitality as their deployment vertical, not hospitality insiders who recognized that a new technical capability could transform their domain. When I backed Uber, Travis understood the taxi medallion system and its vulnerabilities from years of watching urban transportation fail. The knowledge asymmetry between the founder and the market was the investment. Here, the asymmetry runs the wrong direction -- these founders know AI better than hotels, but their competitors can hire AI talent. What they can't easily hire is founders who understand hospitality at a molecular level.

The Computer Use Agent approach -- navigating existing hotel software UIs rather than building API integrations -- is the most intellectually interesting element. It's a genuine technical bet that solves a real problem: legacy PMS systems from Oracle OPERA and others don't expose clean APIs, and building integrations property-by-property is a nightmare. If computer use agents become the dominant paradigm for software interoperability, Lance would be early to something fundamental. But this is where I apply the leverage test, and the answer disappoints me. This is automation, not leverage creation. Replacing a front desk worker who answers phones with an AI that answers phones is a labor substitution -- it saves cost, but it doesn't create a new category of capability that didn't exist before. Uber didn't automate taxi dispatch; it turned every car owner into an entrepreneur and every smartphone into a dispatch system. Notion didn't automate document creation; it gave individuals the organizational power of a team. Lance makes hotels slightly more efficient at doing what they already do. That's a real business, but it's not the kind of leverage multiplication that generates 1,000x outcomes.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. Fifty-plus hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt properties at pre-seed is unusual traction -- that's not a prototype, that's a product in production. The land-and-expand motion through hotel management groups (one deal = dozens of properties) is a distribution mechanism that could compound. If Lance can lock in the major hotel groups before Canary's AI Voice module matures, the switching costs of per-property workflow knowledge could create a defensible position. And the Computer Use Agent approach, while built on commoditizing infrastructure, does accumulate proprietary per-property configuration data that a competitor would need to rebuild from scratch. If I believed the founders had deep conviction about why autonomous operations specifically -- not just AI generally -- is the right wedge into hospitality, and if that conviction were grounded in non-obvious domain insight, I could see this as a focused entrant outrunning a bloated platform. The traction suggests real product-market pull.

But the structural concerns outweigh the traction signal. The Computer Use Agent technology depends on hotel software UIs remaining stable -- and PMS vendors update their interfaces regularly. Each UI change breaks Lance's agents for affected properties, creating a maintenance burden that scales with deployment count. This isn't compounding technology; it's compounding maintenance. The underlying capabilities -- LLMs, voice AI, computer use -- are being commoditized by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google at a pace that erodes any technical moat built on top of them. And the vertical SaaS economics are fundamentally linear: each new hotel requires onboarding, configuration, and ongoing support. There are no network effects where hotel #51 makes hotel #50's experience better. This is a solid business that could generate consistent returns, but it's optimized for a 3-5x outcome in an acqui-hire or vertical rollup, not for the asymmetric 100x+ bets that justify angel capital.
