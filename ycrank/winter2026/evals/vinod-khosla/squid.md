# Squid -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Squid is that it sits at a genuine chokepoint in the energy transition — and the founders have chosen to build a workflow tool rather than exploit the chokepoint itself. The electricity grid is the single largest bottleneck standing between where we are and a decarbonized economy. You can't deploy renewables, EVs, heat pumps, or data centers faster than you can plan and upgrade the grid to absorb them. That bottleneck is real, it's growing, and it's urgent. AI-driven data center demand alone is projected to triple electricity consumption. So when I look at Squid, I see a team that has correctly identified one of the most consequential infrastructure problems on the planet — and then scoped their ambition down to making the planning meetings run better. They're building a collaborative browser workspace for grid operators. If this works perfectly, utilities produce better network models in less time. That's a successful SaaS business. It is not a transformation of how energy systems operate.

This is a case I see frequently: talented founders who know a domain so well that they build the tool they wished they'd had at their last job. Both founders come from Octopus Energy. Jones also worked at National Grid and BCG. Kolokotronis was Head of Technology at Octopus Energy, did AI/ML at AWS, and founded VoltQuant — a geospatial grid intelligence startup that also had National Grid as a customer. These are consummate insiders. They understand the pain of fragmented workflows, legacy desktop tools, and conflicting model versions because they lived it. And that insider knowledge is precisely what concerns me. When you've spent your career inside the grid planning workflow, you see the workflow as the problem. You build better collaboration software. You don't ask whether the entire planning paradigm needs to be replaced — whether AI could eliminate the human planning bottleneck entirely, or whether a fundamentally different grid architecture could make today's planning process obsolete. The insiders optimize the process; the outsiders replace it.

The technology here is the Figma pattern applied to grid planning: take desktop tools (PSS/E, CYME, Synergi), rebuild them as browser-native collaborative software, add versioning and AI acceleration. That pattern has produced valuable companies in design (Figma) and engineering (various CAD tools). But it's a UX and delivery mechanism improvement, not a structural technology disruption. The incumbents — Siemens, DNV, Eaton — face a real business model conflict between perpetual licensing and SaaS, which creates a window. But a well-funded competitor like Neara, which just raised $90M at a $1.1B valuation, could expand from asset management into planning workflows with that kind of capital. Envelio, the most direct competitor, was acquired by E.ON, which limits its reach to E.ON's competitors — that's a genuine market opening. But the underlying technology moat is domain expertise and switching costs, not a proprietary breakthrough that makes alternatives uneconomic.

The strongest bull case for Squid is the timing confluence, and it deserves serious engagement. Grid planning capacity is the binding constraint on the energy transition. The U.S. DOE is launching AI challenges specifically targeting grid planning. Electricity rates rose 13% in 2025 under demand pressure. National Grid DSO — one of the largest distribution system operators — already launched a FlexPortal built on Squid, with their Head of Flexibility Markets publicly endorsing it. That's a remarkable early signal for a pre-seed company. If the energy transition continues accelerating and grid planning becomes the recognized bottleneck, the company that owns the planning workflow for major DSOs controls a critical node. The market is projected to grow from $1.78B to $5.32B by 2033. If Squid captures meaningful share and expands from planning into adjacent decisions — capacity allocation, flexibility procurement, investment prioritization — it could become the system of record for grid operations, not just grid planning. That's a real business with real value. But "real business with real value" is not what I invest for. I invest for outcomes where the world works differently.

The team construction deserves credit: CEO with strategy and operations (BCG plus two major energy companies), CTO with deep technical capability (Cambridge MPhil, AWS AI/ML, prior cleantech startup). They've already achieved SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 — compliance barriers that demonstrate execution discipline rare at pre-seed. The CTO's second-time founder status in the same sector means the learning curve on utility sales cycles and procurement is already behind them. For the specific problem they've chosen, this team is well-engineered. My concern isn't their capability — it's that their capability is precisely calibrated to build a mid-scale enterprise SaaS company in a defined vertical, not to attempt something the industry considers impossible.

I keep returning to the same test: if Squid achieves everything its founders intend, do utilities plan their grids more efficiently, or does the grid itself work fundamentally differently? The answer is the former. The grid still has the same architecture, the same physics, the same constraints. The planning process is faster and more collaborative. That's valuable. It's just not the kind of value I'm built to chase. I'm looking for the company that makes the planning process unnecessary — or that changes what the grid looks like so radically that today's planning assumptions are irrelevant. Squid is a well-positioned, well-timed, well-executed SaaS play in energy infrastructure software. For an investor who optimizes for probability of success in vertical SaaS, this is attractive. For someone who optimizes for the consequence of success at the expense of everything else, the consequence here tops out at a good business, not a changed world.
