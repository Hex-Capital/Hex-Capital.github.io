# Grade -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know before you examine the product, the team, or the traction. Lumanu has raised $20.6 million. Stir has raised $20.7 million at a hundred-million-dollar valuation from Andreessen Horowitz. MONET has raised seventeen million euros. Tipalti processes seventy-five billion dollars in annualized payment volume. And Grade is entering this space with two founders and a YC check. The question is not whether creator payments are complex -- everyone agrees they are, which is precisely the problem. When four funded companies and a $200M+ ARR incumbent are all converging on the same thesis -- "creator economy payments need specialized tooling" -- you are looking at a textbook case of mimetic convergence. These companies are imitating each other into adjacent niches of the same market, differentiating on surface features (agency-side vs. brand-side, creator-to-creator vs. company-to-creator) while competing for the same underlying payment volume. The thesis is consensus. And a consensus thesis, by definition, contains no secret.

What would the secret be here? The implicit claim is that performance-based creator compensation -- pay tied to views, clicks, conversions -- requires fundamentally different payment infrastructure than flat-fee sponsorships. But this is an operational observation, not a contrarian truth. Any product manager at Tipalti or Lumanu can see that performance-based pay is growing. The shift from fixed influencer fees to variable compensation models is discussed in every industry report, tracked by every agency, and anticipated by every platform. If I asked the founders my question -- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" -- I suspect the answer would be some variation of "creator payments are broken." That is not a secret. That is a market report.

The founders deserve credit for genuine domain immersion. Lotanna Ezeike built XPO, a creator payments fintech, and Creator Check, a creator screening tool, before arriving at Grade. James Heaney shipped Pray Screen to $40K MRR in two months and sold a cryptography startup at twenty-two. These are not dilettantes -- they have lived inside the creator economy for years and understand its operational pain. But lived experience and a secret are different things. The trajectory from Creator Check to Grade looks like iteration within a vertical -- testing adjacent products until one gains traction. This is the lean methodology applied to company formation, and it signals indefinite thinking. The founder who has a definite vision does not pivot from screening to payments; he builds payments from day one because he sees something about the payment problem that no one else sees. I do not find evidence of that singular conviction here.

The technology layer compounds my concern. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the core payment orchestration layer is commoditized through Stripe, Wise, and similar infrastructure" and that "a new entrant with payments API access could replicate the basic product within months." Grade's differentiation is workflow -- an "email-to-pay" onboarding flow and native performance-tracking logic. These are user experience improvements, not proprietary technology. They do not clear the ten-times threshold. A better dashboard for calculating variable creator payouts is a feature, not a moat. Tipalti could build it in a quarter if the segment justified the engineering investment. The fact that Tipalti has not bothered yet may say more about the current market size than about Grade's defensibility.

The strongest bull case would require believing that performance-based creator compensation will become so dominant, so quickly, that the company processing the most volume through its platform accumulates compliance data and creator payment histories that create genuine lock-in across 190 countries -- and that Grade can win this volume race against competitors with twenty to fifty times more capital. If you also believe that the horizontal players will perpetually neglect this vertical, and that no social media platform will internalize creator payments, then Grade could compound its way into a defensible niche. The $380K in monthly payouts with 120% month-over-month growth is a real signal of early demand. But even in this optimistic scenario, the outcome is a solid vertical fintech business, not a monopoly. The addressable market for creator payment automation is $3 billion growing to $8 billion -- meaningful, but not the kind of civilization-scale opportunity that produces power-law returns. The best case for Grade is that it becomes a competent, profitable vertical payments company. That is a fine business. It is not a zero-to-one company, and it does not have the structural characteristics that would make it return a fund.

I pass. The absence of a genuine secret, the mimetic competition among well-funded players pursuing identical theses, the commoditized technology stack, and the iterative founder trajectory all point away from my framework. The founders are capable operators in a real market -- but capable operators in competitive markets produce the kind of returns that make venture capital look like a bad asset class.
