# Hlabs -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice about HLabs is the structural shape of its moat — and why it makes me uneasy. A 145% tariff on Chinese robotics components is a real barrier. Forty-plus companies ordering actuator boards in four months is a real demand signal. But a moat created by executive order can be destroyed by executive order. When I invested in Bitcoin in 2014 or Uber in 2010, the structural advantages were rooted in physics and network topology — decentralized consensus, marketplace liquidity effects. Those don't reverse with a trade negotiation. HLabs is building on a policy substrate, not a technology substrate. The tariff creates urgency today. It doesn't create defensibility over a decade.

The specific knowledge question is the one I always ask first, and here the answer is genuinely mixed. Paul Hetherington has the right degree — Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from Bath, which is precisely the intersection where actuator design lives. His embedded systems research in UAV control is relevant. His Twitter shows real hands-on work: PCB layout, motor calibration, firmware tuning. This isn't a business-school founder outsourcing the hard parts. He's the technologist on the team — because he's the entire team. But specific knowledge in my framework isn't just technical competence in the relevant discipline. It's non-transferable insight that takes years to accumulate and that a smart generalist couldn't replicate. A strong embedded systems engineer at any robotics company could design a competitive FOC control board. The deeper specific knowledge would be: understanding which components robotics teams actually waste months sourcing, which integration points cause the most engineering overhead, which defense procurement requirements create the highest willingness to pay. That knowledge comes from years inside the customer's problem, not from the supplier side. Hetherington's six years were spent at Mystic AI building ML inference infrastructure — adjacent but distinctly different. The domain pivot adds useful technical breadth but doesn't give him the kind of deep supply-chain insight that would make him the only person who could build this.

The leverage architecture is where this company hits a structural ceiling. I look for businesses where one engineer's work multiplies across millions of users — Replit, Notion, AngelList. Hardware fundamentally resists that kind of leverage. Each $35 actuator board requires materials, manufacturing, assembly, shipping. Revenue scales linearly with units produced. The open-source firmware is a smart adoption funnel — it creates developer familiarity and integration dependency, similar to how Stack Overflow's community contributions built a knowledge graph no competitor could replicate through engineering alone. But open-source firmware for motor controllers isn't a network-effect protocol. It's a developer convenience. The ecosystem vision — control boards, then main boards, cameras, wireless modules — is the right instinct. If HLabs becomes the integrated component platform that robot builders standardize on, switching costs accumulate across multiple products. That's closer to real leverage. But we're still talking about physical goods with manufacturing margins, not software with zero marginal cost.

The strongest bull case deserves genuine engagement because it maps to a pattern I know well: picks-and-shovels in a gold rush. My portfolio is dominated by infrastructure plays — Alchemy for blockchain, AngelList for fundraising, Replit for coding. HLabs is trying to be the component infrastructure for the robotics wave. And the wave is real: $2.26 billion in robotics funding in Q1 2026. If every humanoid, quadruped, and defense robot startup needs domestic-sourced actuator boards, someone captures that spend. The convergence of tariffs, CHIPS Act incentives, and ITAR restrictions on defense procurement creates a genuine window. If Hetherington executes the product roadmap and builds the manufacturing relationships, HLabs could become the default domestic supplier that robotics startups order from without thinking — the way developers use Alchemy without evaluating alternatives. For this to work, the moat has to migrate from policy to ecosystem: enough integrated products, enough firmware familiarity, enough manufacturing reliability that customers stay even if tariffs drop. That's a plausible path. But it requires execution at a pace that's extremely difficult for a solo founder doing hardware.

And that's the compounding problem. Solo founder building hardware across PCB design, firmware, manufacturing, supply chain, QA, sales, documentation, and customer support — while expanding to four product lines in Q1 2026. I want to invest in technology teams, not lone wolves in a discipline that demands concurrent specialization. Hetherington's prior company, Mystic AI, ran for six years and wound down. I don't penalize failure — most startups fail, and persistence through six years shows stamina. But the pattern is worth noting: a solo-ish founder stretching across too many functions in a domain that rewards depth and teams. The returning-to-YC signal is mildly positive — it shows resilience and a willingness to start again. But hardware at scale requires a co-founder, and I don't see one.

The timing is favorable but not contrarian. Everyone in the robotics ecosystem knows Chinese components just got expensive. Every investor evaluating robotics deals is factoring in tariff-driven reshoring. When I backed Uber, most smart people thought ride-sharing was illegal and would stay that way. When I backed Bitcoin, most smart people thought it was a toy. HLabs is riding a wave that every informed participant already sees. That doesn't make it a bad business — it makes it a fairly-priced opportunity rather than an asymmetrically-priced one. The real contrarian bet here would be that the tariffs are permanent and the robotics wave is bigger than current consensus — but I don't have strong evidence for either, and betting on policy permanence is not how I get paid.

The underlying technology — FOC motor control — is well-understood engineering. ODrive, moteus, and RobStride all produce competitive products. The open-source firmware lowers the replication barrier further. What could compound is the manufacturing expertise, supplier relationships, and multi-product integration — but these are execution moats, not technology moats. They're real, but they don't get exponentially harder to replicate the way a knowledge graph or a trained model does. This is a solid execution play in a favorable market, not a compounding technology bet. I'd want to see the ecosystem strategy crystallize — and a co-founder — before writing a check.
