# Terranox AI -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Terranox is the structural tension between the model and the resources. They've chosen the KoBold Metals playbook -- vertically integrated AI exploration, own the deposits you discover rather than license software -- which is the right instinct. When KoBold finds a lithium deposit, they capture the full value rather than earning a licensing fee. I funded companies built on that logic. But KoBold has $537 million to execute that model. Terranox has two people and YC funding. Vertical integration in physical-world exploration means drilling programs, mineral rights acquisition, environmental assessments, permitting -- activities that burn capital at rates measured in millions per program. The ambition to own the full stack is correct in theory. The gap between that ambition and pre-seed resources is approximately 1,000x. This isn't a software prototype you can iterate on with two engineers and AWS credits. The earth doesn't offer a free tier.

Now let me ask my first question: if Terranox succeeds completely, does the world operate differently? The global uranium market is roughly $3 billion. Exploration expenditures run about $840 million annually. These are real numbers, but they're not the kind of magnitude I orient my portfolio around. Terranox isn't reinventing nuclear energy -- it's finding fuel more efficiently for an existing industry. If their AI is genuinely superior at identifying high-grade deposits, they become a very successful junior exploration company. That's a fine business outcome, but it's not the kind of consequence that makes me ignore failure probability. Compare: when I backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the consequence of success was replacing fossil fuel power generation entirely. When I backed Impossible Foods, it was reclaiming half the world's arable land. Finding uranium deposits 3x faster than traditional geologists is useful. It's not civilization-scale.

The bull case, and I want to engage with it honestly, is that nuclear energy sits at the convergence of two exponential curves I care about deeply: AI capability growth and clean energy demand. Every major tech company is now signing nuclear power agreements because AI data centers need baseload electricity that renewables alone cannot provide. The uranium supply deficit is structural -- 180 million pounds of reactor demand against 130 million pounds of production, and Kazatomprom just cut output guidance by 20 million pounds. Goldman projects uranium at $91-120 per pound. If Terranox's AI discovers even one major deposit in North America, the value of that asset at those prices could return the entire investment many times over. And the timing window is real: U.S. exploration expenditures hit $160 million in 2024, the highest since 2016. The founders are positioned at the right intersection -- a geophysicist who studied planetary systems and an ML engineer from RBC's AI research lab, neither of whom carries the baggage of traditional mining geology. That outsider combination is exactly what I look for. The problem is that this particular confluence of factors -- nuclear renaissance, uranium supply deficit, AI for exploration -- is no longer a contrarian thesis. When Goldman Sachs is publishing uranium price targets, you're not skating to where the puck will be. You're arriving at the arena after they've started selling tickets.

The founders have interesting profiles. Checlair's path from exoplanet habitability research through BCG nuclear strategy to uranium exploration shows a mind that connects domains in unusual ways -- that nonlinear career trajectory sometimes signals the kind of first-principles thinker I back. Lipton's eight years building AI systems at Borealis AI provides the engineering depth needed to make geological ML models actually work, not just look good in a demo. But I see no evidence of the contrarian courage that defines my highest-conviction bets. They're not attempting something the industry says is impossible -- they're applying a validated approach (KoBold proved the model) to a narrower mineral. The uranium-specific focus is interesting as a concentration strategy but it also constrains the consequence of success. If your AI works for uranium, it almost certainly works for lithium, copper, and rare earths too. Why limit yourself to the smallest market?

The technology question is real but not disruptive in the way I evaluate disruption. AI-driven prospectivity mapping improves exploration efficiency -- it doesn't make traditional geology structurally obsolete. A CIM survey found 21% of mining professionals already use AI/ML tools. This isn't a capability that didn't exist before; it's an improvement to an existing capability. At the pre-seed stage, the claim of 70 years of training data is intriguing but unverifiable -- whether they've structured genuinely proprietary negative examples (failed exploration targets, which are far more valuable than successes) or simply aggregated publicly available geological surveys determines whether there's a real moat or marketing language. The technology risk isn't whether ML can identify geological patterns -- it clearly can. The risk is whether the improvement over traditional methods is large enough to justify the capital intensity of proving it through actual drill programs.

I respect the problem -- uranium supply for nuclear energy matters, and some problems are important enough to work on even when the business case is uncertain. But the consequence of success here is a well-run exploration company in a $3 billion market, not a transformation of how the world produces energy. The founders are smart enough for this problem; I'd argue they're smart enough for a bigger one.
