# Human Archive -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Human Archive is the competitive dynamics problem. Scale AI launched its Physical AI division in September 2025, already collecting over 1,000 hours of demonstration data per day through a global contractor network — and Scale has $2B in annual revenue, established enterprise relationships with Kodiak, Skydio, and Toyota Research Institute, and the infrastructure to scale annotation at a pace a four-person team cannot match. When I invested in Harvey, the structural vacancy was the key: no credible incumbent was building legal AI workflow tools because the model fidelity threshold hadn't been crossed yet. Here, the opposite is true. The category is being validated *and* occupied simultaneously. Scale AI isn't a future threat — it's a current competitor with a 12-month head start at massive scale. Add Sensei and Cortex AI from recent YC batches, and this is a market where four startups and an incumbent are chasing the same small set of frontier lab customers. That's not a non-obvious market. That's a crowded one.

The "why now" is real — I'll give them that. Robotics foundation models hit an inflection in 2024-2025: Physical Intelligence raised $600M, NVIDIA launched GR00T, Google DeepMind shipped RT-2, and VC investment in robotics doubled from $3.1B to $7.2B. The sim-to-real gap remains a genuine bottleneck, and real-world multimodal data is structurally harder to generate than text or image training data. But a correct timing thesis shared by everyone isn't a competitive advantage — it's table stakes. When I backed PagerDuty, the market looked boring to other investors. When I backed Coinbase, the market looked scary. The robotics data market in 2026 looks neither boring nor scary — it looks like a gold rush, with Scale AI already operating the largest mine.

The software-driven versus software-aware distinction matters here. Human Archive deploys custom hardware across residential and manufacturing environments in Asia, manages videographers and operations staff, and runs QA and annotation pipelines on the resulting footage. The core of this business is physical operations — logistics, hardware deployment, workforce management. The software layers (annotation, anonymization) are processing tools, not the fundamental competitive mechanism. Remove the software and you still have a data collection services company. That pattern makes me cautious. The bull case requires the accumulated dataset itself to become the defensible asset — an "ImageNet of robotics" that every foundation model trains on. But reaching that scale requires winning an operational race against Scale AI's contractor network, which is purpose-built for exactly this kind of scaling challenge.

The strongest argument for Human Archive is that operational complexity in physical data collection could be a moat — the Samsara pattern, where industrial operations that seem "too physical" for software investors create barriers through accumulated operational know-how. If custom hardware design genuinely captures higher-quality modality alignment than Scale AI's standardized contractor equipment, and if that quality difference matters for frontier model training, then there's a real differentiation story. The team has some relevant signals: Samay Maini's robotics perception background at Contoro Robotics provides domain depth, and the Patel brothers' experience running physical operations (Mango United, Amaetheon Labs) could translate to hardware deployment logistics. But this bull case requires multiple things to work: real-world data must remain significantly more valuable than synthetic data, custom hardware must produce measurably better training data than standardized equipment, the team must scale operations faster than a $29B company's dedicated division, and the buyer set must expand beyond a handful of frontier labs. That's three or four miracles compounding, not one.

The buyer concentration issue is structural, not cyclical. The number of organizations currently willing to pay for massive real-world robotics demonstration datasets is probably under 20 globally. That's not a broken payment structure exactly, but it creates severe negotiation leverage problems and revenue concentration risk that doesn't resolve until humanoid robots are being deployed commercially at scale — which is its own miracle. The founders are young, with prior ventures at very small scale (16,000 mangoes, $15K in grants). YC acceptance is a positive signal, and Jared Friedman as the assigned partner suggests the YC team sees something in the robotics data thesis. But I don't see evidence of distribution thinking, platform expansion vision, or the kind of rapid product shipping that would override my structural concerns. The website is a minimal landing page. No public traction data. No confirmed customers or LOIs. At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of traction, but I need *something* — a working prototype, a named pilot customer, a dataset sample that's gotten a reaction from a frontier lab — to build conviction against the competitive headwinds.

I'm passing. The timing is right but the opportunity is consensus, the competitive landscape is severe, and the business model requires operational scaling that looks closer to services than software-driven infrastructure. The team hasn't yet demonstrated the execution velocity or distribution clarity that would make me comfortable betting against Scale AI's Physical AI division.
