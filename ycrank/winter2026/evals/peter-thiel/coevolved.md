# Coevolved -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing fact in this dossier is not a number -- it is a timeline. In January 2026, Coevolved archived its open-source multi-agent orchestration framework on GitHub. Weeks later, it appeared in YC Winter 2026 as "Agents for Mortgage Origination." This is not a company built on a secret about the mortgage industry. This is a team of capable engineers who built a general-purpose tool, found no traction, and went searching for a vertical to apply it to. The sequence tells you everything about the epistemic foundation: the founders did not discover something hidden about how mortgages work that the industry refuses to see. They discovered that general-purpose agent frameworks need a market, and mortgage origination has a lot of documents. That is not a secret. That is a PowerPoint slide.

What is the contrarian thesis here? That AI can automate document-heavy processes in mortgage origination? National Mortgage News is publishing headlines about 2026 being "pivotal for mortgage AI adoption." Blend has $685 million in funding and is already integrating AI. Tavant powers one in three U.S. mortgage loans. Ocrolus raised $80 million specifically for document processing in lending. Candor has patented automated underwriting. The thesis that AI will transform mortgage origination is not contrarian -- it is the most consensus view in mortgage technology today. When every incumbent, every trade publication, and every technology vendor agrees on the direction, there is no secret left to exploit. You are entering a market where the question is not "will AI transform this?" but "which of the many well-capitalized players will win?" That is the definition of competition, and I have a strong view on what competition produces.

The Girardian dynamics here deserve explicit articulation. "AI agents for [vertical industry]" is the most mimetic startup category of 2025-2026. Dozens of YC companies are pursuing the identical form: take LLM capabilities, apply them to a document-heavy regulated industry, claim 75% efficiency gains. Each imitates the others not out of malice but out of the same logic -- the same conference talks, the same VC feedback, the same market sizing decks. Coevolved's specific capabilities -- document OCR, data extraction, form auto-fill, anomaly detection -- are individually available from horizontal AI platforms. The "agentic orchestration" layer that ties them together is an architectural pattern, not proprietary technology. A well-funded competitor could assemble equivalent capabilities in months. The company's own website claims it can "cut document chasing by 75%" -- a fourfold improvement, not an order of magnitude. That is exactly the range where competition thrives and margins collapse.

To be fair to the bull case: the founders are technically impressive. Athan Zhang did NLP research under Danqi Chen at Princeton, interned at Five Rings, and previously raised $1.2 million for a medtech startup. Alex Li has distributed systems experience from The Trade Desk and voice AI work at Ultravox. These are not untalented people. The strongest argument for Coevolved would be that incumbents like Blend and Encompass were architectured in the pre-LLM era, face classic innovator's dilemma dynamics (they cannot cannibalize their manual-review revenue streams), and that a native agentic system built from scratch will outperform retrofitted AI features bolted onto legacy workflow tools. If Coevolved could deeply integrate with a specific segment of independent mortgage bankers -- the MBA IMB26 conference suggests this is the target -- and build switching costs through workflow dependency, a small monopoly could emerge. The timing thesis (LLM capabilities crossing a reliability threshold for regulated documents) is genuinely sound. But this bull case is a thesis about the market opportunity, not about this specific company's structural advantage. Any competent AI team with mortgage domain expertise could execute the same playbook, and several already are.

The domain expertise gap is the compounding problem. Neither founder has documented experience in mortgage lending, loan origination, financial services compliance, TRID rules, GSE requirements, or state licensing. Mortgage is one of the most heavily regulated consumer financial products in existence. Building AI agents that make underwriting decisions requires not just technical capability but deep understanding of fair lending laws, CFPB oversight frameworks, and the specific ways that lenders evaluate risk. When I co-founded Palantir, the key insight was not merely that good algorithms existed -- it was that we understood, through direct experience with PayPal's fraud systems, exactly how to adapt those algorithms for intelligence analysis. The domain knowledge was the secret, not the technology. Coevolved has the technology but not the domain knowledge, and in regulated industries, that asymmetry is usually fatal.

I pass. The company is entering a competitive market with a consensus thesis, wielding competent but non-proprietary technology, led by talented engineers who lack the domain-specific insight that would constitute a genuine secret about how mortgages should work. The pivot from general-purpose framework to mortgage vertical signals indefinite searching rather than definite conviction. There are too many well-funded players pursuing the same opportunity for any of them to achieve the kind of monopoly that produces power-law returns.
