# Fort -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Fort is a genuine schlep-blindness pattern. Millions of serious lifters know their wearables are bad at tracking strength training. WHOOP's own data shows strength workouts on their platform grew 122% year-over-year. The demand is screaming. And yet nobody has built a dedicated strength-first wearable. Why? Because the people who lift and hack are almost always software engineers, and software engineers unconsciously filter out problems that require manufacturing physical objects. Building a consumer wearable means dealing with supply chains, sensor calibration, injection molding, firmware, FCC certification -- the kind of tedious, unglamorous work that makes a smart programmer's eyes glaze over. Fort's founders don't have that filter because they're not software people. They're Tesla mechanical and electrical engineers who happen to lift. That's exactly the kind of founder-problem alignment that produces schlep-blindness opportunities: people whose specific background makes them immune to the unconscious avoidance that keeps everyone else away.

Miranda Nover's frustration with existing wearables appears genuine -- she's discussed it on podcasts, and the team explored EMG sensors before pivoting to heart-rate-and-motion, which tells me they've been thinking about this problem technically, not just commercially. The idea passes the organic test. But I want to be precise about what kind of organic this is. It's not Dropbox-level organic, where Drew Houston forgot his USB drive on a specific bus ride and the product crystallized from that moment. It's more like "we all lift, we all hate our wearables, and we realized we have the hardware skills to fix it." That's real, but it's a widely shared frustration, not a unique founder insight. The schlep willingness, though -- that's strong. Leaving Tesla to build a consumer hardware startup at pre-seed is not something you do casually. Consumer hardware is the schlep that kills most startups, and these founders ran toward it.

Here's what worries me. WHOOP already has IMU and PPG sensors on millions of wrists. The exact same sensor suite Fort is using. WHOOP could, in theory, ship a software update that adds exercise auto-detection and proximity-to-failure tracking without changing a single piece of hardware. They already have 122% more strength training data flowing through their platform year over year -- that's training data for exactly the algorithms Fort needs to build from scratch. Fort's multi-mount form factor (magnetic equipment attachment, body straps) is a genuine hardware differentiator that WHOOP can't replicate with firmware. But it's an open question whether users want to magnetically attach sensors to gym equipment badly enough to buy a second wearable. The competitive moat depends on whether wrist-only tracking is fundamentally insufficient for strength training, or merely suboptimal. If it's suboptimal, WHOOP wins by being good enough. If it's fundamentally insufficient, Fort wins by being the only company solving the actual physics problem.

The team composition gives me a specific concern that I think most observers would miss. All three founders are mechanical engineers. Paul Schneider's sensing systems work at Tesla is relevant, and I give him credit for that -- cabin radar involves signal processing that maps to sensor fusion. But building a wearable that auto-detects 50+ exercises and estimates proximity to failure is primarily a software and machine learning problem. The hard part isn't the hardware (commodity IMU and PPG sensors in a sub-30g package is achievable). The hard part is the algorithms that turn noisy accelerometer data into accurate rep counts across dozens of exercises, in real time, on a power-constrained device. I see no public GitHub repos for any founder. I see no ML or embedded software background. This doesn't mean they can't do it -- Tesla engineers are resourceful and the boundaries between hardware and firmware are blurry at that level -- but it's a gap I'd want to probe directly.

The strongest bull case for Fort is this: if strength training continues its trajectory as the dominant fitness modality (driven by longevity culture, GLP-1 adoption creating demand for muscle preservation, and the general cultural shift away from pure cardio), then the company that owns strength tracking will be enormously valuable. WHOOP built a $3.6 billion company around recovery. Oura built an $11 billion company around sleep. Neither will pivot to strength-first because it would dilute their brand identity and require different hardware decisions. Apple and Garmin optimize for breadth, not depth. There's a structural opening for a strength-first wearable that becomes the default for the serious lifting population -- and that population is growing fast. If Fort ships a product that genuinely works, and if the multi-mount form factor proves necessary for accurate tracking, they could own this category the way WHOOP owns recovery. The Tesla background means they might actually survive the manufacturing gauntlet that kills most hardware startups. That's a real scenario.

But today, Fort is pre-ship with a Q3 2026 target, no disclosed pre-order numbers, no evidence of organic user pull beyond press coverage, and a founding team whose software capabilities are unproven. The idea is organic and the schlep is real, but I need to see the product work before I'm convinced the team can build both the atoms and the bits. I'd watch Fort closely through their ship date, but I'm not writing a check today.
