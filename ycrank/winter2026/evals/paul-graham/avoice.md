# Avoice -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I look at with any startup is how the founders found the problem. Not the market size, not the technology, not even the team -- the origin story. And with Avoice, I can't find one. Chawin's background is Stanford management science, Southeast Asian EdTech, and food surplus delivery. Chawit ships iOS apps and plays competitive chess. Neither founder has any publicly documented experience working in architecture, using architectural documentation tools, or living inside the pain they're claiming to solve. When I see two smart siblings from Thailand building "The AI Workspace For Architects" without any visible connection to architecture, the most likely explanation is that they surveyed verticals ripe for AI disruption and picked one. That's the startup idea machine at work, not organic discovery.

The frustrating thing is that the problem itself is real. Architecture documentation is a genuine schlep -- building codes that vary by jurisdiction, CSI MasterFormat specifications that run thousands of pages, professional liability concerns that make every generated sentence legally consequential, coordination across structural engineers, MEP consultants, and contractors who all speak slightly different technical languages. This is exactly the kind of tedious, regulatory-heavy complexity that causes most founders to unconsciously look away. The schlep is there. But the whole point of schlep blindness is that the people best positioned to solve these problems are the ones who've been suffering inside them for years and finally decide they can't take it anymore. When outsiders identify the schlep through market analysis, they get the market right but underestimate the depth of domain knowledge required to actually navigate it. An architect who's spent a decade writing specifications and catching coordination errors has intuitions about what matters that you can't replicate by reading about it.

The bull case deserves a real hearing. Architecture firms genuinely do waste enormous time on documentation across fragmented tools -- that's not invented. LLMs with multimodal capabilities have made architectural document understanding newly feasible in the last two years, so the timing thesis holds. The competitive landscape is mostly adjacent rather than directly overlapping: Swapp requires BIM workflows, Monograph is project management, TestFit is pre-design feasibility. The pure documentation intelligence layer -- specs, codes, QA, institutional knowledge -- is relatively unoccupied. And the sibling co-founder dynamic is actually one of the stronger team structures I've seen; people who grew up together don't fall apart the way strangers who met at a co-founder matching event do. If these founders can recruit a senior architect as a third co-founder or key early hire, and if they're genuinely in the field doing unscalable things with real firms, this could work. WeStride's growth to 1,000+ customers in its first year shows Chawin can sell and execute.

But "could work with the right additions" isn't an investment thesis. Right now I'm looking at a team that can build software and has proven they can hustle in EdTech, applying that capability to a domain they don't appear to know. The product claims -- 13 hours saved per user per week, $25K annual productivity per user -- are marketing copy with no named customers or verifiable metrics behind them. "Trusted by top architecture and design studios" with no firm names disclosed is the kind of claim that means anything from "we have 50 paying firms" to "we gave a demo to someone once." There's no revenue data, no user counts, no growth rate, no named customer. At pre-seed I don't demand much traction, but I need some signal that real architects are pulling this product toward them, and I see none.

The competitive dynamics add another concern. Swapp has $18.5M and is already automating architectural construction documentation with firm-specific learning. Autodesk owns the entire AEC workflow and has been acquiring AI capabilities. When you're an outsider to the domain entering a space where incumbents have deep customer relationships and well-funded startups have a head start, you need either extraordinary domain insight or extraordinary founder-market fit to win. I don't see evidence of either here. This looks like a competent team that could succeed in a vertical they understand deeply, applied to a vertical they discovered from the outside. I'd want to back these founders -- just on a different problem.
