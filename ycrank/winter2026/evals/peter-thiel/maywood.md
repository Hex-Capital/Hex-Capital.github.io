# Maywood -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me everything I need to know about whether a secret exists here. Datasite acquired Grata for $200 million in June 2025. One month later, Datasite acquired Blueflame AI. CapVest committed $500 million to expand Datasite's capabilities further. OffDeal raised $17 million to build an AI-native investment bank. F2 AI raised $10 million and is expanding from private credit into broader deal workflows. When an incumbent with $158 million in revenue is acquiring AI companies at nine-figure valuations and multiple startups are raising eight-figure rounds around the same thesis, you are looking at a market where the "secret" is already front-page news. Everyone can see that investment bankers waste time on repetitive document generation. Everyone agrees that LLMs can automate CIM production and comparable analysis. This is not a secret -- it is the most consensus observation in financial technology today. The entire sector is entering a Girardian spiral: multiple players imitating each other's positioning, competing for the same bank procurement budgets, and burning capital to reach the same customers. I have seen this pattern destroy value repeatedly.

The question I would ask Drake Goodman is my standard one: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" Based on the dossier, the company's thesis is that AI can automate M&A deal execution -- a proposition that literally no informed person disputes. The differentiation claim is that Maywood is "purpose-built for M&A" versus horizontal AI tools, but this is a positioning choice, not a contrarian insight about the world. Stripe's secret was not that payments could be easier -- it was that developers, not procurement departments, would become the decision-makers for payment infrastructure. That was genuinely non-consensus in 2010. I see no equivalent structural insight here about why the M&A execution workflow will be transformed in a way that only Maywood understands. The company's own framing -- "Banks do not lose deals because of bad judgment. They lose time to repetitive work" -- is a statement that every managing director at every investment bank would nod along to. When everyone nods, there is no secret.

The founding team has the credentials that conventional VCs find reassuring -- Wharton summa cum laude, Blackstone private equity, BCG consulting, MIT EECS, an ICML publication. These are genuinely strong backgrounds. But they are precisely the profile I criticized in the cleantech disaster: polished, credentialed professionals from elite institutions executing on a consensus thesis. The CTO's ICML paper on neural methods for solving PDEs demonstrates real research capability, which I respect. But the product applies existing LLM technology to document generation -- this is an application layer, not a technological discontinuity. The customer testimonial quantifies the improvement as "doubling our capacity," which is 2x, not 10x. A twofold improvement invites competition from every direction: from Datasite bolting AI onto its existing data room platform, from Bloomberg or S&P Capital IQ extending their financial data terminals, from Microsoft integrating Copilot more deeply into the Office suite that every banker already uses. When your improvement is merely proportional rather than exponential, you are in a race you cannot structurally win.

The strongest bull case would require believing that deep integration into a bank's data ecosystem -- emails, files, meetings, internal databases, firm-specific formatting conventions -- creates switching costs that compound into a durable moat, analogous to how Palantir's government deployments become structurally impossible to rip out. If Maywood can establish itself as the connective tissue of a bank's deal execution workflow, displacing it might require rebuilding years of customized outputs and integrated data pipelines. Middle-market banks are plausibly underserved by Datasite, which focuses on large enterprise, creating a beachhead that Maywood could monopolize before expanding upmarket. The sibling co-founder dynamic and the MIT research connection suggest a team with genuine trust and technical depth. If the AI quality threshold for financial document generation is higher than incumbents appreciate, and if Maywood's head start in firm-specific training data creates a compounding advantage, this could become a meaningful vertical SaaS business. But a meaningful vertical SaaS business is not a power-law return. The exit path here is almost certainly acquisition -- Datasite already demonstrated willingness to pay $200 million for Grata and undisclosed amounts for Blueflame. This is a company built to be bought, not a company built to dominate its category for decades. And companies built to be bought are companies that never achieved monopoly.

The fundamental problem is structural: Maywood is making an existing process incrementally more efficient rather than creating something that did not previously exist. Going from a 6-month deal cycle to a 3-month deal cycle is valuable, but it is the definition of going from 1 to n rather than from 0 to 1. No new category is being created. No previously impossible capability is being enabled. The world after Maywood succeeds looks the same as the world before, except that investment bankers copy fewer numbers into PowerPoint slides. That is not a future worth designing.
