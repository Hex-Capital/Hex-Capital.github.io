# Seeing Systems -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Seeing Systems is that they describe themselves as "Anduril, but with worse weather, and better banter." This is meant as a joke, but it reveals something structurally important: the company defines itself by reference to a company I co-invested in and know intimately. When a startup positions itself as a regional variant of an existing category leader, it is telling you -- in its own words -- that it is going from one to *n*, not from zero to one. The next Anduril will not be another Anduril. Palmer Luckey did not pitch Anduril as "Palantir, but for hardware." He articulated a fundamentally different vision of how autonomous systems would restructure defense. Seeing Systems has not articulated what truth about warfare they see that Anduril, Helsing, Shield AI, and Stark have all missed.

The deeper problem is that the thesis underlying this company -- low-cost autonomous strike drones will reshape modern warfare -- is no longer a secret. It is the most widely held view in European defense circles in 2026. The Ukraine conflict demonstrated it on live television. The European Commission announced a "once-in-a-generation surge" in defense spending with drones and AI as explicit priorities. Germany awarded nearly a billion euros in kamikaze drone contracts to three companies in a single procurement round. When every defense minister, every think tank analyst, and every venture capital firm in Europe simultaneously concludes that autonomous strike drones are the future, you do not have a secret -- you have a consensus. And when the consensus forms, mimetic competition follows inevitably. Helsing has raised over a billion euros. Shield AI has raised over a billion dollars. Stark has raised $62 million. Cambridge Aerospace has raised $130 million. The Girardian dynamics are textbook: every player imitates every other player, capital floods in, margins compress, and the field begins to resemble food delivery with explosives -- a large, undifferentiated market where no single entrant achieves monopoly returns.

The claimed advantage -- "more than 2x reduction in lifecycle cost" -- is the company's own framing, and it explicitly fails the threshold. I have written that proprietary technology must be at least ten times better than its closest substitute to create genuine monopolistic advantage. Two times better invites competition; ten times better makes the old approach uneconomic. A 2x lifecycle cost improvement is the kind of incremental advantage that a well-funded competitor replicates in eighteen months, particularly when Helsing alone has roughly 2,800 times more capital to deploy toward engineering optimization. The modularity concept is potentially interesting -- the ability to swap components without redesigning entire platforms could accelerate iteration speed -- but modularity is an architecture choice, not a proprietary technology barrier. Any competent engineering team can design modular drone systems, and several already are.

The strongest argument for this company is the founders' existing relationships with military operators, combined with Alexander Le Maitre's genuine domain experience designing EOD hardware at Wildcat I.S. for NATO forces and Special Forces units across Europe. Defense procurement is trust-mediated. Clearances, operational testing, doctrinal integration -- these create switching costs that pure capital cannot buy. If Seeing Systems has already established itself as a trusted supplier to UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces at the prototype stage, that relational capital is real and potentially durable. Matthew's pedigree -- top-ranked Cambridge MEng, Jane Street -- signals the kind of raw intellectual capacity that matters in building autonomous systems. The brothers have complementary competencies that map precisely to the two sides of the problem: military hardware and autonomous software. For this investment to work, you would need to believe that relationship-mediated trust in defense procurement creates a durable enough moat to overcome thousand-to-one capital disadvantages, and that the European market specifically wants nimble domestic suppliers rather than American companies or billion-dollar incumbents. There is some evidence for both propositions. But "some evidence" for a consensus thesis in a crowded market does not create the conviction required for a power-law bet.

The capital asymmetry is the final structural concern. This is a hardware company -- atoms, not bits. Manufacturing drone platforms at military specification requires supply chains, production facilities, quality assurance processes, and significant working capital. Five hundred thousand dollars funds prototype iteration; it does not fund production scale-up for multiple NATO forces. Every hardware defense company I have backed -- Anduril, General Matter -- required hundreds of millions in capital to reach production capability. Seeing Systems will need to raise dramatically more, and they will be competing for that capital against companies with orders of magnitude more traction and validation. Stark's experience is cautionary: despite $62 million in funding and a credentialed founder, all four of their strikes failed in military trials. The distance between a working prototype and a battlefield-ready production system is measured not in iteration cycles but in engineering depth that only sustained investment can build.

I respect the founders' domain experience and their decision to build in a civilizationally important sector. Defense technology matters -- I have spent two decades and billions of dollars on that conviction. But importance and investability are different questions. The autonomous strike drone market in 2026 is important and crowded, which means it will produce many participants and few monopolists. Without a genuine secret -- a truth about autonomous warfare that contradicts the current consensus -- this company is competing, not monopolizing. And competition, as I have said more times than I can count, is for losers.
