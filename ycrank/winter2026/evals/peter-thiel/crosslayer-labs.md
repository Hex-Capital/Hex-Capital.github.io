# Crosslayer Labs -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

There is something genuinely rare here that demands attention before anything else: this team authored a globally mandated internet standard. CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC-067, unanimously approved, now governs the issuance of roughly eight million HTTPS certificates every day. Henry Birge-Lee coded the first implementation in 2016, published the seminal USENIX paper in 2018, and co-wrote the ballot that made it law. When I co-founded Palantir, we took PayPal's fraud algorithms and adapted them for intelligence -- we brought a capability from one domain into another where it created structural value. Crosslayer Labs is attempting the same maneuver: take the deep understanding of cross-layer internet infrastructure attacks that produced MPIC and commercialize it as an enterprise monitoring platform. The parallel is instructive -- but the differences are more important than the similarities.

The question I always ask first: what is the secret? The implicit claim is that the internet's trust infrastructure is vulnerable across interacting layers -- BGP, DNS, TLS, JavaScript dependencies -- and that existing security tools are architecturally blind to this class of attack because they were built to scan for known vulnerabilities, not to correlate signals across protocol layers. Is this actually contrarian? The MPIC mandate itself undermines the claim to contrarianism. When the CA/Browser Forum unanimously approves your standard, the industry has agreed with you. The threat model is no longer a secret -- it is consensus. What remains potentially contrarian is the belief that continuous cross-layer monitoring is commercially necessary beyond the certificate issuance point. But even that thesis has to contend with a market where Censys has raised $131 million, CyCognito sits at an $800 million valuation, and CrowdStrike acquired Reposify to add EASM directly into Falcon. This is not a blue ocean. The attack surface management market has multiple well-funded players pursuing adjacent capabilities, and the cross-layer correlation that Crosslayer offers -- while technically differentiated -- reads more as a feature that incumbents could absorb than a category that creates monopoly.

The founders made a strategically generous decision that weighs heavily in my analysis: they open-sourced the MPIC implementation. The Open MPIC Project is now used in production by leading certificate authorities. This is admirable from a civilizational perspective -- they made the internet more secure for everyone. But from a monopoly perspective, they gave away the moat. Palantir never open-sourced Gotham. SpaceX never published its landing algorithms. When you create proprietary technology that the world depends on, you charge for access -- you do not publish it on GitHub with sixteen stars. The decade of accumulated knowledge about how BGP, DNS, TLS, and JavaScript supply chains interact remains valuable, but it is a depreciating asset once the research is public. Any sufficiently motivated team at Cloudflare or CrowdStrike can read the papers, study the standard, and build correlation engines.

The strongest bull case requires me to consider a Palantir-like trajectory: a team with unparalleled domain expertise building an enterprise product that becomes deeply embedded in critical infrastructure monitoring workflows over years. Prateek Mittal's ACM Grace Hopper Award, his influence on the Tor network and Let's Encrypt, the team's relationships with certificate authorities at Google, Apple, and Amazon -- these are genuine assets. If Crosslayer Labs can build a product that becomes the standard monitoring layer for enterprises worried about infrastructure-level impersonation, switching costs compound over time. The crypto vertical is particularly interesting -- the KlaySwap incident ($2 million lost from a single compromised JavaScript file) demonstrates that this attack class has immediate, quantifiable consequences in financial infrastructure. A razor-sharp focus on protecting crypto exchanges and DeFi protocols could create a beachhead where Crosslayer's specific capability is genuinely ten times more valuable than anything Censys or CyCognito offers. But I see no evidence that the team has identified this narrow wedge or articulated a concentric expansion strategy from it.

What concerns me most is the absence of commercial conviction. Three Princeton academics -- two PhD students and a tenured professor -- with no documented startup experience, no prior exits, and a chief scientist whose tenure and active research lab suggest part-time commitment. Deep technical capability is necessary but not sufficient. Alex Karp had a philosophy doctorate and no business background when we started Palantir, but he had the ferocity of a founder who burned every alternative path. I see no evidence here that these founders have made the irreversible commitment that distinguishes builders from researchers. The website is generic enterprise SaaS language -- "protect, monitor and defend your Internet presence" -- rather than the kind of specific, architecturally ambitious vision that signals definite optimism. Y Combinator will teach them how to sell, but it cannot manufacture the commercial instinct that separates a transformative company from a well-cited research project. The power-law math is also challenging: even aggressive capture of the $5 billion projected ASM market produces outcomes that are good -- not extraordinary. This does not have the structural characteristics of a company that returns the entire fund.
