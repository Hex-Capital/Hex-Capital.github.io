# Cardboard -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me be direct about what I see here: a talented two-person team that has scoped their ambition to fit comfortably inside a market. They're targeting "growth and marketing teams that use video as a distribution channel" with a browser-based editor that generates first-cut edits. The pricing tiers are sensible. The named customers are real. The traction is respectable for pre-seed. And I stop right there -- because the question that governs everything I do is: if Cardboard succeeds completely, does the world operate differently? The answer is that marketing teams produce video faster. That's a productivity gain, not a structural transformation. The AI in video editing market is projected at $4.4 billion by 2033. Even the bullish estimate tops out at $9.3 billion. Compare that to the systems I fund companies to displace -- trillion-dollar industries where success means the incumbent approach becomes obsolete. Cardboard's maximum success scenario is a well-run SaaS business in a competitive vertical. They've narrowed the aperture to ensure viability, and in doing so, they've made the consequence of full success a rounding error on the scale where I operate.

The underlying technology trajectory is the one piece that activates my rate-of-change framework. Multimodal LLMs reasoning over video -- understanding speech, visual content, narrative structure simultaneously -- crossed a capability threshold in 2024-2025. WebGPU and WebCodecs matured enough to run a real NLE in the browser. That convergence is genuine, and the innovator's dilemma facing Adobe is real: rebuilding Premiere Pro's decades-old desktop rendering stack for browser-native, agentic-first editing would cannibalize their professional user base. This is the same structural trap Cisco faced when TCP/IP routing threatened their legacy architecture -- the incumbent can't adopt the new approach without destroying the old business. But here's where the analogy breaks: when I backed Juniper against Cisco, TCP/IP routing was going to restructure the entire telecommunications infrastructure of the planet. When Cardboard challenges Adobe, the consequence is a better editing tool. The technology window is real; the magnitude of what walks through it is not.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Square started as "a slightly better way to accept payments" -- a dongle on an iPhone -- and became the infrastructure layer for small business commerce, eventually a $45 billion company. Could Cardboard be the browser-native editor that gradually replaces desktop NLEs for everyone, not just marketing teams? If the agentic layer becomes reliable enough that uploading raw footage and specifying "30-second product launch video" produces broadcast-quality output, you've eliminated the need for human editors in a huge swath of video production. That's a labor displacement story, and labor displacement at scale does produce real economic impact. The 15-year co-founder relationship and complementary skill set -- Ishan's browser performance engineering from HackerRank mapping directly to the WebGPU core, Saksham's AI research and growth expertise mapping to the agentic layer and distribution -- suggest a team assembled with purpose, not accident. PostHog as a named customer signals credibility within the YC developer ecosystem. If I squint hard enough, I can construct a path where this team rides the AI capability curve into a position that makes desktop video editing software structurally irrelevant.

But I don't invest on constructed paths -- I invest on consequence magnitude. And several things pull this firmly away from my thesis. First, the core AI capability is rented, not owned. They're running Claude Sonnet through an API. The differentiation is in orchestration -- how reliably the system translates a high-level goal into a timeline of editing operations. That's an execution advantage, not a technology moat, and it's vulnerable to any team with browser engineering talent and the same API access. Descript has $101 million and is backed by OpenAI. Runway has $860 million. These aren't sleeping incumbents -- they're well-capitalized, technically sophisticated competitors adding agentic capabilities to existing products with existing user bases. Second, the founders are not outsiders attacking a problem the consensus considers impossible. They're skilled engineers building a video editor in a market where a dozen well-funded companies are building video editors. Nobody looked at them funny. Nobody told them it was crazy. The experts aren't dismissing it -- they're doing the same thing with more resources. That absence of contrarian signal is telling.

What concerns me most is the pattern I see repeatedly: founders who are clearly capable choosing a problem calibrated to their comfort rather than to the scale of impact they could achieve. These two have genuine technical chops -- a kid who built a utility with 5.7 million downloads at age fourteen, a researcher published at ACL, engineers who understand browser rendering at a deep level. They could be working on something where success reshapes how an industry functions. Instead they're optimizing video production workflows for growth teams. The technology underneath -- AI that comprehends and edits video autonomously -- is a capability that could be pointed at far larger problems: democratizing filmmaking in developing economies, transforming how scientific research is communicated, restructuring how news organizations operate. But the founders chose the safe, addressable market. They reduced their probability of failure to the point where the upside, even fully realized, doesn't move me.

This is a pass. Not because the company is bad -- the team is complementary, the timing is reasonable, the early signals are healthy. It's a pass because the problem they've chosen isn't large enough to justify the talent they're deploying against it, and the technology differentiation is too thin to sustain against competitors with fifty to a hundred times their capital.
