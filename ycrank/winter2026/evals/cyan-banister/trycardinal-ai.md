# Cardinal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that jumps out at me immediately with Cardinal is that this is one of the most crowded, consensus-popular categories in tech right now. AI for sales outbound. Clay just hit $3.1 billion in valuation with over $100 million in ARR. Apollo.io is at $150 million ARR. Andreessen Horowitz led a $50 million round into 11x.ai. Every fund in San Francisco has an AI SDR company in their portfolio or on their wishlist. When I look at a market and see that level of investor enthusiasm, my instinct is to walk the other direction. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX when private space was considered a billionaire's fantasy, Uber when ride-sharing was flatly illegal -- were companies that other investors actively dismissed. Cardinal is building in a space where other investors are tripping over themselves to write checks. That's not my signal. That's the absence of my signal.

When I sit down with founders, the first thing I want to hear is their story. Not the product, not the TAM -- I want to understand how they arrived at this specific problem and why they're the ones who need to solve it. Devi and Jianna have genuinely impressive credentials -- Harvard and MIT computer science, experience at Meta, DoorDash, Nvidia, a successful exit of Leafpress to Johnson Controls. That exit is real. Processing $30 million in energy retrofits for clients like Lindt and Honeywell and getting acquired by a Fortune 500 company is no small thing. But here's what I notice: their actual biographical passion is sustainability. Devi co-founded a nonprofit advising P&G and Unilever on sustainability, did carbon accounting at Sephora and Spotify, mentored at Techstars on ESG. Jianna made Forbes 30 Under 30 in the Social Impact category. These are founders whose life stories were pointing them toward environmental and social impact work -- and now they're building AI outbound tooling for B2B sales teams. Their connection to outbound sales is that they had to do cold outreach to sell Leafpress. That's a valid observation about a real pain point, but it's an experience they had, not a calling they can't escape. When I backed the Contraline founders, those researchers had spent years in the lab on male contraception before anyone would fund them. That's biographical commitment. Here, the pivot from sustainability to document intelligence to outbound sales reads more like talented founders searching for the right hot market than founders who are biographically tethered to this problem.

The bull case is real, and I want to be honest about it. Repeat founders with a prior exit, 40+ YC companies already using the product, and positioning in the gap between Clay's manual workflows and 11x's fully autonomous SDR -- that's a defensible wedge if they can execute. Their co-founder relationship is genuinely strong through my lens. After HQ Trivia taught me that co-founder conflict can destroy even a perfectly timed product, I now look explicitly at whether co-founders have been stress-tested. Devi and Jianna went through YC together, built a company, navigated an acquisition, and chose each other again for round two. That's the kind of partnership durability I wish I'd seen more of in my portfolio. If I were evaluating them purely on team resilience and execution capability, I'd be much more interested.

But I keep coming back to what's missing through my lens. Cardinal doesn't make an invisible system visible the way Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities or Carta replaced opaque cap table spreadsheets. It doesn't create economic access for underserved populations the way Uber created income for drivers or Affirm provided transparent credit. It makes already-funded B2B startups better at selling to other businesses. That's a legitimate business, potentially a very good one -- but it doesn't carry the deeper positive-sum impact I gravitate toward. And the space has no regulatory moat, no stigma to navigate, no structural complexity that would deter well-capitalized competitors. Clay, Apollo, and 11x can all build similar signal-driven workflows with their existing data assets and engineering teams. The barrier to entry is low, and the incumbents have data advantages Cardinal will struggle to match at pre-seed scale.

These are strong founders building in a space that doesn't activate my framework. I'd bet on Devi and Jianna to build something meaningful -- they've already proven they can -- but I'd want to see them tackling a problem where their sustainability background and social impact instincts are an advantage rather than something they've left behind. For Cardinal specifically, the consensus enthusiasm in the market, the thin biographical connection to sales tooling, and the absence of economic access or regulatory complexity all point me toward passing, despite real respect for the team.
