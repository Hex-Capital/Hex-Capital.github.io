# FullSeam -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Look, I wrote the pass example for this company before I'd ever heard of it. An AI agent that logs into your existing accounting tools and automates AR/AP workflows? This is the platonic ideal of what I mean when I say the AI startup opportunity is mostly a mirage. Remove the LLM capability and FullSeam ceases to exist -- it's not a finance operations business enhanced by AI, it's an AI product dressed in accounting clothes. My "cherry on top" test exists precisely for this moment: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. And that tells me everything about the structural position.

The founders are the complicated part of this evaluation, and I want to be honest about that. Tom Dowling is a Rhodes Scholar who co-founded TaxProper, grew it to processing over a billion dollars per year in property tax payments across 115,000+ properties, and sold it to Opendoor. All three co-founders went through that entire journey together -- built together at UIUC, survived the grind of financial operations software together, navigated an acquisition together, and now they're back for round two through YC. That's exactly the kind of co-founder relationship I trust. These are sane people by any measure. The problem isn't the founders. The problem is that "AI agent for accounting" is the sanest idea in the YC W26 batch. Every VC with a pulse is excited about this category. Bill.com has already shipped AI Agents. Tipalti raised $200 million specifically earmarked for AI capabilities. When I say I look for a sane person with an insane idea, the "insane" part is doing the heavy lifting -- it's the non-consensus element that creates the return premium. FullSeam is a sane person with an extremely sane idea, and that combination produces market-rate returns at best.

The structural moat analysis is where this really falls apart through my lens. FullSeam's defensibility is entirely software-based: integrations across nine platforms, AI agent reliability, configured workflow embeddings. This is precisely the category of moat I've been arguing is dissolving in real time. Bill.com has 500,000 SMBs and 9,000 accounting firms already on its platform. When Bill.com's AI agents get 80% as good as FullSeam's -- and they will, because the underlying LLM capabilities are commoditized -- distribution wins. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the underlying LLM capabilities powering AI agents are widely available" and that integration complexity "is replicable by well-resourced competitors." Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is operational -- actual painting crews showing up at houses. No amount of AI improvement lets a competitor replicate that without building the same physical operations. FullSeam has no physical-world component, no protocol position, no lock-in that survives cheaper software.

The dossier makes an interesting structural argument -- that an AI agent operating across multiple platforms including Bill.com itself is structurally difficult for Bill.com to replicate because it would cannibalize their own platform lock-in. I've heard this incumbents-can't-cannibalize argument many times, and it's occasionally right, but it's far more often wrong. It was the core thesis behind dozens of failed startups that assumed banks couldn't do mobile payments, that Microsoft couldn't do cloud, that Google couldn't do AI. The incumbents cannibalize when the threat is real enough, and a cross-platform agent threatening their customer relationships is exactly the kind of threat that triggers defensive innovation. Besides, the real competitive dynamic isn't just Bill.com -- it's the twenty other AI-agent-for-finance startups that are emerging simultaneously, all with access to the same LLMs and the same APIs.

The strongest bull case here is that integration complexity across financial systems is genuinely harder than it looks -- that handling partial payment matching, multi-currency GL coding, and vendor-specific invoice formats creates compounding edge-case knowledge that's difficult to replicate even with better models. If the team's domain expertise from TaxProper translates into meaningfully faster iteration on these financial edge cases, and if switching costs from configured workflows prove stickier than I expect, FullSeam could carve a defensible position in mid-market finance before incumbents close the gap. The team has proven they can build financial operations software at scale, and they've proven they can exit. For an investor who believes AI-native tools will replace incumbent SaaS rather than being absorbed by it, this is a strong bet. But that's not my thesis -- my thesis is that the incumbents with distribution win the AI race, and everything in this dossier confirms rather than challenges that view.

FullSeam occupies no protocol position, creates no new primitive, and builds no infrastructure that other businesses depend on. It's an application sitting on top of QuickBooks, Stripe, Xero, and Salesforce -- entirely dependent on their APIs, their data formats, their rate limits. If any of those platforms restricts API access or builds their own agent layer, FullSeam's value proposition narrows overnight. This is the opposite of protocol-layer investing. The narrative can expand -- "AI employee for all back-office functions" -- but that narrative belongs to the category, not to FullSeam specifically, and a dozen companies are telling the same story.
