# Ruma Care -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company built by a founder who worked as a Medical Assistant in a rheumatology infusion clinic, experienced the hell of prior authorization paperwork firsthand, and went back to build software to fix it. That's real founder-market fit -- the kind of person who knows exactly where the pain is because they've had their hands in it. And yet, when I ask my first question -- if this succeeds completely, does the world operate differently? -- the answer gives me pause. If Ruma Care wins, infusion clinics process insurance paperwork faster. Denial rates drop. Clinics recover revenue they were losing to unreimbursed drug costs. That's a real business. It might even be a good business. But nobody's world changes. The biologics still cost $80-150K per year. The insurance system still gatekeeps patient access through prior authorization. The buy-and-bill model persists. Ruma Care makes a broken system work slightly less badly -- it doesn't replace the system.

The competitive landscape tells the same story. CoverMyMeds was acquired for $1.1 billion by McKesson, proving there's real value in PA automation. But that acquisition happened in 2017 -- this category has been ventured, built, acquired, and absorbed by an incumbent. Cohere Health has raised $200 million for payer-side PA automation. Infinitus has raised $103 million for AI-powered PA phone calls. Waystar is a public company with over a billion in revenue that announced PA automation expansion in 2025. Ruma Care's argument is that none of these players are "biologics-first" -- and that's true. But specializing in a narrower niche of an already-established category is exactly how you reduce the probability of failure while making the consequences of success smaller. A "biologics-first PA platform" is a feature inside CoverMyMeds' roadmap, not an industry transformation.

The strongest bull case requires me to take seriously two things. First, the patient access dimension: 37% of biologics are denied by insurers annually, and these are not optional medications -- they're treating rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, cancer. A 50% reduction in denial rates means patients getting life-changing treatment they were being denied. That matters. Second, the data flywheel: if Ruma Care accumulates enough payer-specific denial pattern data across enough medication-diagnosis-insurance combinations, they build a proprietary mapping of what actually gets approved -- and that knowledge compounds. Combined with the CMS-0057-F regulatory tailwind forcing faster PA decisions starting January 2026, and LLM capabilities that now enable extraction of unstructured payer criteria at costs that weren't possible three years ago, the timing is genuinely favorable. If this team executed flawlessly, expanded from rheumatology into oncology infusion and other specialty clinics, and built the definitive denial-pattern dataset, you could see a $500M-$1B outcome. That's real money, and for an angel check, the returns would be meaningful.

But here's what I notice that a generic healthcare investor might not: the technology itself -- LLM-based form extraction, criteria matching, automated form-filling -- has no structural defensibility. Every major healthcare IT company has access to the same models. Epic could integrate PA automation into their EHR workflows tomorrow. The denial-pattern data flywheel sounds compelling in theory, but in practice, CoverMyMeds processes orders of magnitude more PA volume and could build the same dataset faster. The moat here is thin, and in healthcare IT, thin moats get absorbed by platform incumbents. When I invested in Square, mobile payments didn't just make cash registers faster -- they made the entire traditional POS infrastructure economically irrelevant. That's disruption. Making insurance forms auto-fill is optimization.

The founding team is well-assembled for the problem they've chosen. Meng Fei Shen brings the clinical workflow knowledge and has shipped at scale (Uber One to 13M+ members). Christina Huang brings ML engineering depth from Apple and direct healthcare integration experience from Medallion's United Healthcare work. They're Yale classmates who've known each other since freshman CS50 -- that's a durable co-founder relationship. But they're insiders to this problem, not outsiders reimagining it. They know what's painful about prior authorization. What I look for is someone who asks why prior authorization exists at all, or whether biologics should cost $150K per year, or whether the insurance model for specialty drugs is fundamentally broken. Those are the questions that lead to transformational companies. Automating the forms leads to a solid SaaS business.

I pass on this investment. Not because the founders aren't capable -- they clearly are. Not because the problem isn't real -- it clearly is. But because the ambition is calibrated to the administrative machinery of healthcare rather than to the system itself. These founders are too talented to spend their careers making insurance paperwork more efficient. The problem that actually demands a solution is why 37% of patients prescribed life-saving biologics are denied access in the first place -- and that requires attacking the incentive structure of insurance, not automating the forms it generates.
