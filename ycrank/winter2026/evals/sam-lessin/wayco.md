# Wayco -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The structurally interesting move here is Wayco's stated intention to become a law firm itself rather than just sell software to law firms. That's the one element that made me sit up. If you told me a company was building AI-powered intake for law firms, I'd close the tab -- that's a feature, not a company, and every legal CRM with an engineering team will ship it this quarter. But saying "we're going to actually become a licensed legal practice so we can participate directly in referral fee economics" is a fundamentally different proposition. That's a company saying it wants to be Craftwork for legal -- a law firm with a tech layer, not a tech company with a legal paint layer. And in a world where referral fees in personal injury run 25-33% of the attorney's fee against a $61B market, the direct-participation economics are dramatically better than charging law firms a SaaS subscription for intake software.

The problem is the founder-idea pairing. Iqbol Temirkhojaev is clearly a talented builder -- 3x Olympiad gold medalist, exits at 14 and later, software patent at 15. These signal raw capability that I take seriously. But my framework asks whether the specific founder is credibly competent for *this specific* idea. Becoming a licensed law firm across multiple U.S. states requires navigating bar admissions, state-by-state ethical rules on referral fees (Florida caps at 25%, other states have different structures), unauthorized-practice-of-law exposure, and multi-jurisdictional compliance. A 19-year-old solo founder from Tajikistan with a background in competitive coding and AR education apps does not carry specific credibility for executing that regulatory gauntlet. Jared Friedman's endorsement is meaningful, and the $1.5M pre-seed from Sequoia Scout Fund and ElevenLabs/Groq investors says smart people believe in this kid's ability to learn fast. But the "sane" in my equation requires domain-specific sanity, not just general brilliance. The pairing feels inverted: the AI-intake product is the sane, consensus idea, and the founder's ambition to navigate legal regulation without legal expertise is the insane part -- but not in the productive way I look for.

Run my AI kill test on the core product and the result is unambiguous: voice AI intake built on VAPI, Twilio, and commodity LLMs is precisely the kind of thing that gets absorbed. Smith.ai already offers AI receptionist services for law firms. Filevine has $400M in funding and serves 100,000 legal professionals. The moment any of these incumbents decides to build a cross-firm referral feature -- and the voice AI to power it -- Wayco's technology advantage evaporates. Strip away the AI components and ask what's left: there is no business without the AI layer. That's the exact opposite of what I want to fund. The law-firm-licensing strategy is the potential escape from this trap, because a regulatory position can't be commoditized by cheaper software. But it's stated intent with zero demonstrated progress, and the regulatory complexity could consume years of a solo founder's bandwidth.

Let me steelman the bull case, because the structural vision deserves it. If Wayco actually executes on becoming a licensed referral law firm with AI-driven intake and achieves network density in personal injury -- the highest-volume, most referral-dependent practice area -- it could become genuinely new infrastructure. A referral network where Wayco IS a party to the referral (not just a software facilitator) and captures a percentage of every case routed through the network starts to look like a new primitive in legal services. The $5-6.5B implied referral fee economy in PI alone is a real market with real money flowing through it. And the cold-start marketplace problem, while real, has a known playbook -- the market-by-market rollout mirrors how Uber, DoorDash, and others built density city by city. If the founder hires a general counsel who actually knows legal practice, brings on a co-founder with legal domain depth, and executes the licensing strategy in two or three states before trying to scale nationally, this could compound into something structurally defensible. The Teamshares analogy works: an operationally ugly, regulated-industry play that most investors dismiss as too complex. But Teamshares had founders who had lived inside the problem of small business ownership. Iqbol hasn't lived inside legal practice, and that gap between ambition and domain credibility is what keeps me on the sideline.

The narrative can theoretically expand -- PI referrals to all legal referrals to legal network infrastructure -- and the trillion-dollar legal services market provides ceiling. But the expansion path is linear and regulatory-gated, not exponential. Each new state requires separate compliance work. Each new practice area requires learning different referral dynamics. This is a grind business masquerading as a tech business, which I actually like in principle, but the solo founder with no legal background makes the grind feel more like a liability than a moat-building exercise. At pre-seed with no revenue, no customers, and a pre-launch product, there's no downside cushion -- this is a pure narrative bet, and the narrative depends on regulatory execution that the founder hasn't demonstrated capacity for.
