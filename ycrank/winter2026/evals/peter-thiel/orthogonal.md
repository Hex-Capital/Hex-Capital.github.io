# Orthogonal -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first and most damning signal. Skyfire has raised $9.5 million. Nevermined has $7 million. Coinbase and Cloudflare launched x402. Stripe and OpenAI built ACP. Google shipped AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. Prava closed a seed round. Masumi is building MCP monetization. And Orthogonal enters this arena with two founders, 14 API integrations, and a pay-per-call marketplace. When I count the players in a market and run out of fingers, I know there is no secret -- there is only a consensus wearing different logos. Every one of these companies shares the same thesis: AI agents need payment infrastructure. When McKinsey is projecting your TAM at $3-5 trillion by 2030, you are not exploiting a hidden truth about the world. You are riding a wave that every sophisticated actor in fintech and AI has already identified. The mimetic convergence is overwhelming. These companies are not competing to create a new category; they are imitating each other into a zero-sum war over a market that doesn't yet generate meaningful revenue for anyone.

What is the secret here? I keep looking for it and I cannot find one. "AI agents will consume APIs and need unified access" is not a contrarian insight -- it is the consensus view of every infrastructure investor, every payment network, and every AI lab in Silicon Valley in 2025. A genuine secret would be something like: "Most APIs will become free because agent traffic will be so valuable as a distribution channel that providers will pay to be consumed" -- that would be contrarian, non-obvious, and would structure an entirely different business model. Or: "Agent-to-agent payment settlement will happen entirely on-chain, making traditional billing infrastructure obsolete" -- that would be a specific bet against the incumbent payment stack. Instead, Orthogonal occupies the most crowded intersection imaginable: API aggregation meets agent payments meets MCP integration. The technology is competent integration work -- wrapping third-party APIs with unified authentication and per-call billing -- but it is not a zero-to-one discontinuity. RapidAPI has aggregated APIs for years. What Orthogonal adds is an agent-native interface, which is a genuine improvement but not an order-of-magnitude one. Changing from 30 API keys to one is a convenience, not a technological revolution.

The structural vulnerability is severe. Orthogonal sits as middleware between two layers that have every incentive to vertically integrate. Below: Stripe, Coinbase, and Visa are building payment protocols for agents -- and Stripe already has a massive API provider network through its existing payment relationships. Any of these could add discovery and aggregation features to their protocol. Above: Anthropic, which created MCP, could build API marketplace features directly into Claude. Cursor or Codex could integrate preferred API providers natively. The middleware layer between protocol infrastructure and agent frameworks is precisely the layer that gets compressed when the players above and below it have both the incentive and the resources to expand. Palantir succeeded as a software layer between raw intelligence data and government analysts because neither the data sources nor the analysts could build what Palantir built -- the integration required genuine algorithmic sophistication. I do not see analogous technical depth in API aggregation that would prevent either layer from replicating it.

The strongest bull case requires believing that marketplace network effects will compound faster than incumbents can respond. If Orthogonal reaches 500+ high-quality API integrations with meaningful developer adoption before Stripe adds discovery to ACP or Anthropic builds an API marketplace into Claude, the supply-side density and developer switching costs could create a defensible position. The Stripe analogy is instructive -- Stripe won developer payments not through superior technology but through superior developer experience, and the compounding effect of documentation, integrations, and community made it structurally difficult to displace. If Orthogonal achieves that same developer-love dynamic for agent API consumption, the marketplace could become self-reinforcing. The founders have the right backgrounds for this specific problem -- Pickett built payments at Coinbase and billing at Vercel, Sogut built APIs at Google and is a two-time ICPC World Finalist, which signals serious engineering capability. But the Stripe comparison breaks down on a critical dimension: when Stripe launched, there was no well-funded competitor building the same thing. The payment processing incumbents were asleep. Here, every major player is awake, funded, and building.

I see competent founders with relevant domain experience building a reasonable product in a market with no secret and no path to monopoly. The founders met at McGill and combine payments expertise with API engineering -- that is a sensible pairing, not a visionary one. I do not see the kind of definite conviction that characterizes the founders I back: there is no evidence of a specific, detailed vision for how the world looks when Orthogonal wins, no refusal of an easier path, no intellectual framework beyond "agents need unified API access." The business reads as a well-executed response to a market trend, not as a founder-driven reimagination of how APIs should work. Pay-per-call with a margin is a reasonable business model, but it is not a monopoly architecture. This is a pass.
