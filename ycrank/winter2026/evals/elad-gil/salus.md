# Salus -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Salus is who they're competing against: not just well-funded startups (Galileo at $68M, Fiddler at $100M, Patronus at $40M), but the platforms themselves. OpenAI's Agents SDK already includes a guardrails section in its documentation. Anthropic could add this. LangChain could add this. The integration surface Salus depends on -- decorators wrapping tool calls within specific frameworks -- is precisely the surface those frameworks control. This is the "market-ending move" dynamic I've written about, except here the move could come before the market has even formed. When I invested in PagerDuty, the alerting workflow wasn't something monitoring platforms could easily absorb -- PagerDuty owned the on-call schedules, escalation policies, and team configurations that created real switching costs. A `@session.protect()` decorator is not that. It's thin integration, and thin integration means thin switching costs.

The structural moment driving this market is real -- I want to be clear about that. The shift from LLMs generating text to agents executing consequential actions (refunds, database mutations, API calls) is happening right now, and it genuinely creates a new failure mode. When an agent's output was a paragraph of text, a bad output was embarrassing. When an agent's output is a $10,000 refund processed against the wrong order, that's a different category of risk entirely. The "why now" is legitimate. But a legitimate "why now" that everyone can see is not the same as a non-obvious market at a structural inflection. Gartner has already named this the "guardian agent" category and projected it will capture 15% of the AI market within four years. When Gartner has named your category before you've shipped, you're not in a non-obvious market -- you're in a consensus one. My best investments have been in markets that triggered dismissive reactions from other investors. This market triggers the opposite: immediate head-nodding agreement that agents need guardrails. That's a warning sign.

The product-to-distribution trajectory concerns me most. Stripe started with a payments API, but the API became a developer relationship that distributed Atlas, Billing, Radar, and Treasury. What does Salus distribute through its guardrails API? The expansion path from "validate this tool call" to a multi-product platform isn't articulated and isn't obvious to me. Policy templates, PII detection, budget controls, human-in-the-loop -- these are features of a single product, not the seeds of a platform. The core concept is architecturally straightforward: intercept a tool call, check it against a policy, block or pass. The dossier itself acknowledges that "any observability or agent framework vendor with SDK-level access to tool calls could build similar functionality." That's the definition of a feature, not a company. I need to see that the product is software-driven in a way that compounds, and I don't see the compounding mechanism here.

The strongest bull case is this: every observability vendor and platform company will build "good enough" guardrails, but "good enough" won't actually be good enough for production-critical agent actions. Financial services, healthcare, legal -- these verticals will demand specialized, battle-tested validation that generic platform guardrails can't provide. If Salus accumulates enough production data on agent failure modes across diverse deployments, they could build proprietary validation logic that generic solutions can't match. The 58% blocked-action recovery rate and the self-correction feedback loop are architecturally interesting -- they suggest the product isn't just blocking bad actions but teaching agents to fix themselves, which is harder to replicate than simple policy checks. And if agent deployment scales as projected (40% of enterprise apps by end of 2026), the demand for specialized guardrail infrastructure could be enormous enough that multiple companies win. In this scenario, Salus is the focused, developer-native option in a market big enough for specialization. What would need to be true: the platforms build inadequate native guardrails, enterprise buyers demand dedicated validation infrastructure, and Salus ships fast enough to build a data moat before the well-funded competitors lock up the market.

But I don't think that's the most likely path. The founders are current Stanford undergraduates competing in enterprise infrastructure against teams with $68M+ in funding and Fortune 50 customer relationships. Vedant Singh's research credentials are genuinely impressive -- multi-lab LLM research, the CryptoAgents multi-agent system, the Linguistics Olympiad work -- and the academic foundation is strong. But enterprise infrastructure sales require production reliability guarantees, SLAs, security certifications, and support infrastructure. That's a different skill set than building research prototypes, and the competitive landscape doesn't give them time to learn it gradually. This is a market where the timing is right but the positioning is wrong for this team at this stage. I'd want to see evidence of enterprise design partners, production deployments with real latency benchmarks, and a clear articulation of why this is a company rather than a feature before I'd get comfortable.
