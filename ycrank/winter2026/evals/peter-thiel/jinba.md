# Jinba -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know before you examine anything else. Zapier generates $310 million in annual revenue. Workato has raised $421 million. n8n raised $253 million and grew users sixfold in 2025. Tray.io has $164 million in funding. And every single one of them is building AI-powered workflow generation right now -- Workato launched "Genies" in August 2025, n8n is integrating LLM-assisted building. Jinba is entering this arena as a four-person team with YC's standard check. This is not a market with a hidden secret waiting to be exploited. This is a market where the thesis -- "LLMs will replace drag-and-drop workflow builders" -- is so consensus that every incumbent is already executing on it. When every player in a $15 billion market converges on the same AI-powered future simultaneously, that is the clearest possible signal that no one possesses a secret worth investing in.

The question I always ask is: what important truth does this company see that others do not? Jinba's implicit claim is that conversational workflow creation -- "vibe-coding" -- will displace traditional builders, and that a startup can execute this shift faster than the incumbents. But this is not a contrarian belief. It is a description of what is already happening across the industry. A secret must be something most intelligent people actively reject. No serious person in enterprise software rejects the premise that AI will transform workflow automation. They are all building it. The mimetic dynamics are precisely what Girard would predict: every company imitating every other company's AI strategy, converging on the same features, the same positioning, the same customer pitch. Jinba is not escaping this mimetic field -- it is entering it as the smallest, least-resourced participant.

The strongest bull case rests on the claimed 40,000 enterprise users in Japanese financial institutions and the on-premises deployment capability with compliance features. If this traction is real, it represents something genuinely harder to replicate than the AI interface layer: trust relationships with regulated enterprises who have already integrated Jinba into compliance-sensitive workflows. Japanese financial institutions are notoriously conservative about vendor selection, and dislodging an embedded workflow tool from a bank's internal processes creates real switching costs. The path would be: dominate Japanese financial services as the trusted on-prem AI workflow platform, build deep vertical expertise that no horizontal player can match, then expand concentrically to other regulated verticals and geographies. This is actually a legitimate small-market-first strategy. But the dossier notes that no third-party source confirms the 40,000 figure, and the simultaneous geographic pivot -- rebranding from Carnot to Jinba, relocating to San Francisco, joining YC -- suggests the founders may be abandoning the beachhead before fully monopolizing it. A company that truly dominated Japanese financial services workflow automation would not need to pivot to the US market at the pre-seed stage; it would deepen that monopoly until it became unassailable.

The founding team is technically competent -- Matsumori's PhD and Preferred Networks background provide genuine ML credentials, and Norisugi's McKinsey experience is relevant to enterprise sales. But competence is not what I invest in. I invest in founders whose vision of the future is so specific and so at odds with conventional wisdom that most people think they are wrong. I see no evidence of that here. The McKinsey pedigree is precisely the "men in suits" pattern I have learned to avoid in technology companies -- it signals someone who can analyze a market opportunity, not someone who has an obsessive, singular insight about how the world must change. The company's strategy reads as market-responsive rather than vision-driven: LLMs became capable, workflow automation is a large market, conversational interfaces are trendy, therefore build a conversational workflow tool. This is indefinite optimism -- the belief that the AI wave will be good and that riding it will work out -- without a definite plan for why Jinba specifically wins against opponents with hundred-fold resource advantages.

The technology itself compounds the problem. Jinba's core capability -- translating natural language into workflow logic -- runs on third-party LLMs from AWS, Azure, and Meta. This is an application layer, not proprietary technology. There is no 10x advantage here; there is a different interface paradigm for capabilities that Zapier's 8,000 integrations deliver through an established, battle-tested platform. When your product's differentiation can be replicated by any competitor with an API key to the same foundation models, you do not have a technological moat. You have a head start measured in months, not years. And months do not compound into monopoly.

I pass. The workflow automation market is a Girardian arena of mimetic convergence where every player is building toward the same AI-powered future. Jinba possesses no visible secret -- no truth about the world that the consensus rejects. The technology is an application of commodity LLMs, not a discontinuity. The founding team is capable but shows no sign of the extreme, idiosyncratic conviction that produces category-defining companies. And the competitive structure -- four well-funded incumbents, all adding AI capabilities, all targeting the same enterprise buyers -- is precisely the configuration that destroys value for every participant. Even the most promising signal, the Japanese financial services traction, is unverified and potentially being abandoned mid-execution. This is a company that will compete, and I do not invest in competition.
