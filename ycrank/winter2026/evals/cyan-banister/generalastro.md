# General Astronautics -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The thing that immediately catches my attention about General Astronautics is the capital intensity paradox. Two founders, roughly $500K from YC, building space-rated robotic hardware in a sector where their nearest competitor GITAI has raised over $60 million and Varda has pulled in $329 million. My first angel check ever was SpaceX -- private space when the entire world thought it was lunacy -- so I'm not someone who flinches at ambitious space bets. But SpaceX had Elon's track record, his personal fortune as a backstop, and a biographical obsession with making humanity multiplanetary that you could feel radiating off him in every conversation. What I need to know about Bram Schork and Shibo Zhou is: why robots in microgravity? What happened in their lives that made this the problem they'd crawl through glass to solve? And the dossier gives me almost nothing. Caltech mechanical engineering, a SpaceX Starlink Lasers internship, Carnegie Mellon robotics. These are solid credentials -- genuinely relevant ones -- but credentials are the résumé, not the story. I start every evaluation by asking founders to tell me how they got here, not the business, and right now I'm staring at a blank page where that narrative should be.

The niche itself has a quality I recognize -- it's specific, it's hard to assess, and it's not popular. Nobody is writing breathless TechCrunch pieces about the robotic labor layer for microgravity manufacturing. That's usually where I lean in. The timing convergence is genuinely interesting: the ISS deorbiting around 2030, Axiom and Vast and Orbital Reef all building commercial stations that will need robotic infrastructure, launch costs dropping with Starship, and AI autonomy advancing enough that you can plausibly imagine robots operating without real-time human control in orbit. Someone has to build the hands that do the work up there, and the incumbents -- Northrop Grumman, Maxar -- have cost structures and sales cycles optimized for massive government contracts, not iterative commercial hardware. There's a structural opening here that a fast-moving startup could exploit. I've seen this pattern before -- it's how Anduril found its gap in defense tech. But Anduril had Palmer Luckey, a founder whose entire biography screamed that he was going to drag defense technology into the modern era whether the Pentagon liked it or not. The biographical conviction has to match the difficulty of the space.

Let me steelman the case, because I want to be honest about what could make this extraordinary. If General Astronautics establishes flight heritage first -- gets a robotic system qualified and demonstrated in orbit -- the moat becomes enormous. You can't replicate microgravity manipulation data on Earth. Commercial space station operators would standardize on a single robotic platform rather than qualifying multiple vendors. The 29.7% CAGR projected for in-space manufacturing suggests this market is about to expand dramatically, and the picks-and-shovels player who provides the robotic labor could capture an outsized share. The SpaceX hardware reliability experience Bram brings is genuinely valuable -- understanding how to design systems that survive thermal cycling, radiation, and vacuum is hard-won knowledge. And the CMU robotics credential for autonomy isn't just a nice pedigree; Carnegie Mellon's robotics program is where serious manipulation and perception research happens. If these two founders have the resilience to survive what will be a grueling, multi-year qualification journey with multiple fundraising gauntlets, this could become something remarkable.

But I keep coming back to two gaps that are central to how I evaluate companies. First, the co-founder dynamic is completely opaque. They attended different universities on opposite coasts -- Caltech in Pasadena, Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh -- with no visible shared employer or project history. How did they find each other? How do they fight? The lesson I carry from HQ Trivia is seared into my decision-making: that company failed entirely because of founder conflicts, and the product and timing were perfect. Space hardware development will test a co-founder relationship through years of qualification delays, funding crunches, and technical setbacks. I need to understand the bond before I write a check.

Second, the economic access dimension -- which matters deeply to me -- is thin here. The immediate customers are pharmaceutical companies and space station operators, not underserved communities. You could construct a downstream argument that microgravity-manufactured drugs could eventually reach patients at lower cost, but that's several leaps removed from the kind of direct impact I saw with Uber creating income for drivers or Affirm providing transparent credit to people locked out of traditional finance. This is infrastructure for an emerging industry, and infrastructure can be transformative, but it's hard for me to feel the human stakes in the same visceral way.

General Astronautics sits in a genuinely compelling market window with technically relevant founders, but I can't evaluate what I can't see. The biographical narrative, the personal stakes, and the co-founder relationship are all invisible to me, and those happen to be the exact dimensions I weight most heavily. I'd want a conversation with Bram and Shibo before forming real conviction -- to hear their stories, to understand what brought them together and why they'd endure the long journey this particular company will demand. Without that, I'm left with credentials and market timing, which are necessary but never sufficient for the kind of bet I make.
