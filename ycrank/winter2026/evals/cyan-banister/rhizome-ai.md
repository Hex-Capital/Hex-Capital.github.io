# Rhizome AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Rhizome: this is one of the most competent pre-seed execution stories I've seen -- a solo founder who took an enterprise product into pharma regulatory affairs and hit six figures in revenue in under a year, with 20+ customers. That's genuinely hard to do. Selling anything to pharma companies is a slog even with a full sales team, let alone as a one-person operation. So the execution earns real respect. But when I sit with it, I keep asking myself the question I always ask: *why this person, why this problem?* And what I find is a smart career arc -- document processing at Instabase, biology AI at EvolutionaryScale, then noticing that nobody was building tools for bringing drugs to market versus discovering them. That's sharp pattern recognition. It's the kind of insight a talented engineer surfaces at exactly the right time. But it's not the kind of biographical fusion I look for, where the founder and the problem are inseparable. Chetan Mishra identified a gap in the market. He didn't live through it.

The product itself is something I'd describe as well-built and well-positioned, but not strange. AI-powered question-answering over domain-specific document corpuses -- that's the most popular application category in enterprise AI right now. Every vertical has three or four companies doing this. Legal, construction, healthcare compliance, insurance. The fact that Rhizome does it for regulatory affairs with a 2.5TB corpus and claims zero hallucinations is impressive on the quality dimension, but the architecture is familiar. Nobody is looking at this company and saying "that's insane, why would anyone build that?" -- which is usually the signal I'm drawn to. When I backed Crusoe Energy, people thought flaring gas into computation was a joke. When I wrote my SpaceX check, people thought private rockets were a fantasy. This company feels like it's solving a real problem in a way that makes intuitive sense to most investors. That's fine -- it just means the consensus has already formed around the opportunity, and my edge isn't in consensus bets.

Where Rhizome genuinely activates something in my framework is the regulatory complexity dimension. Pharma regulatory is one of those spaces that scares off most early-stage investors because the sales cycles are long, the accuracy requirements are extreme, and the stakes of being wrong are enormous. The zero-hallucinations claim across 2,800+ questions in 2025 -- if that holds up under scrutiny -- represents a quality bar that matters deeply in regulated industries. I've been comfortable in regulated and stigmatized spaces since my IronPort days, and I understand that the complexity itself becomes a moat when others won't enter. But I want to distinguish between *stigmatized* complexity (where my portfolio tends to cluster -- defense tech, male contraception, psychedelic therapy) and *boring* complexity (enterprise compliance tooling). Rhizome sits in the latter category. It's hard, but it's not the kind of hard that makes other investors emotionally uncomfortable.

The bull case I have to be honest about: if Clarivate's bolt-on AI assistant is mediocre -- and incumbents bolting AI onto legacy platforms usually produce mediocre results -- then Rhizome has a genuine window. The Clarivate business model is oriented around dashboards and change-tracking subscriptions, not generative Q&A with document-level citations. Rearchitecting that product risks cannibalizing their existing revenue stream, which creates exactly the kind of innovator's dilemma opening that startups exploit. And the founder's specific background -- building document extraction systems at Instabase for banks, then shipping a developer platform at EvolutionaryScale that scaled to billions of API calls -- is precisely the technical skillset needed here. If he hires a regulatory domain expert as a co-founder or early employee who brings the lived experience piece, and if he can maintain the quality bar while scaling, this could become the default tool for regulatory affairs teams the way Carta became the default for cap tables. That's a real outcome. But it requires several things going right simultaneously, and it doesn't give me that visceral jolt I felt with Niantic or the quiet conviction I had with Flock Safety.

What I notice through my own lens is a subtle version of the transparency pattern -- making invisible regulatory expectations visible and accessible. FDA thinking is buried in terabytes of documents that currently require expensive consultants or weeks of manual research to decode. There's something there. But when I trace who benefits from that transparency, it's pharma regulatory affairs teams at companies that already have resources. This isn't creating economic access for people who lack it. It's making an already well-funded function more efficient. I can't tell myself the story I told about Uber creating income for drivers, or Affirm providing transparent credit to underserved borrowers. The indirect argument -- faster regulatory navigation means faster drug approvals means patients benefit -- is real but attenuated. This is a company I'd expect to do well, maybe very well, but it's not the kind of bet that reflects why I invest.
