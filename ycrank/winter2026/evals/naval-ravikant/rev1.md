# REV1 -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive structure here tells you everything you need to know about the contrarian thesis — or rather, the absence of one. DraftAid raised through YC two years ago solving the identical problem. SolidWorks shipped Auto-Generate Drawings as a native beta feature in 2025. Siemens NX includes automated 2D drawing creation. When the incumbent platform owner, a direct YC-backed competitor, and your startup are all converging on the same feature at the same time, you're not betting against a gloomy crowd on the upside. You're joining the parade. The consensus says "CAD drawing automation should exist." Everybody agrees. That means the pricing — in terms of market position, not dollars — already reflects the opportunity.

The specific knowledge question is where I wanted to find something that would override the competitive concern. Alex Rivero designed parts at Tesla's Motor Design team and Apple's iPhone 17 lineup. He personally sat in SolidWorks placing section views and GD&T callouts for production parts. That's real. He felt the pain in his hands. But here's the distinction I keep coming back to: every mechanical engineer at every hardware company in the world has felt this exact pain. This isn't knowledge that exists outside the standard professional pipeline — it IS the standard professional pipeline. The DraftAid founders identified the same gap. The SolidWorks product team identified it. When I backed Evan Williams at Twitter, his insight about public self-expression wasn't something every journalist already understood — it was something he'd been circling for years that surprised people who thought they knew communication. Rivero's insight — "2D drawings are tedious and should be automated" — would surprise exactly no one who's ever used SolidWorks. Louis Liu brings credible ML engineering (solo-built Tesla's Supercharger planning platform, published ML researcher), and the combination of a domain expert with a production-grade ML engineer is the right team composition. But the knowledge isn't non-transferable. It's the kind of problem identification that emerges from professional experience, not from obsessive curiosity that produces contrarian positions.

The leverage architecture is what concerns me most through my framework. Automating 2D drawing generation from 3D CAD files makes existing mechanical engineers faster at an existing task. That's efficiency. It's not leverage. Compare to Replit, which lets someone who's never written code build software — that's creating a new form of capability for a new category of person. REV1 doesn't enable a new type of work or a new type of worker. It shaves hours off a documentation step for people who already have the core skill. Valuable? Absolutely. The kind of leverage that produces nonlinear output from minimal marginal input? No. This is a workflow automation tool, and workflow automation tools scale linearly with customer count, require per-platform integration work (each CAD format is separate development), and compete on feature depth within someone else's ecosystem.

The bull case I'd want to believe: GD&T accuracy is safety-critical in aerospace and medical devices, and the incumbents' native features will stay permanently "good enough but not great" because drawing automation is too narrow to justify dedicated R&D investment within a broad platform. A focused startup achieves dramatically higher accuracy against ASME Y14.5 standards, builds a data flywheel from every processed drawing, and becomes the de facto standard that engineers insist on regardless of what their CAD vendor ships — the way Grammarly became essential despite every word processor having spell check. If REV1's GD&T accuracy compounds with every drawing processed, and if the manufacturing tolerance for errors is so tight that "pretty good" native features never cross the adoption threshold, there's a real compounding business here. But DraftAid is executing on exactly this thesis with a two-year head start and reported $150K in pilot contracts. And the structural problem remains: you're building a feature inside someone else's platform, and the platform owner has every incentive and capability to absorb it.

I respect the founders' decision to leave Tesla and Apple — that signals genuine conviction, not the identity of "being a founder." The team composition is right. But the bet itself is a feature, not a platform. It creates efficiency, not leverage. It arrives at consensus timing, not contrarian timing. And it faces both a funded direct competitor and incumbents who are already shipping. These are the marks of a company where the founders are smart and the problem is real but the investment doesn't produce the asymmetric upside I need. My best investments have all been in companies that created something that didn't exist before — not companies that automated something that already existed slightly faster.
