# DAIVIN! -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that hits me about DAIVIN! is the sheer audacity of the idea: splitting seawater molecules into breathable oxygen in real-time, at depth, strapped to a diver's body. Nobody has done this in a hundred years of diving technology. Every other company in the space -- BLU3, AirBuddy, Brownie's -- is still pumping compressed air through a hose from the surface. They're iterating on the same fundamental paradigm that existed when Jacques Cousteau was alive. Leo Kankkunen looked at that and said the entire framing is wrong -- oxygen supply isn't a gas logistics problem, it's an energy problem. That kind of reframing is what I live for. It's the same quality I saw in Crusoe, where they looked at wasted gas flares and saw stranded computation. The companies I've made the most money on are the ones that sounded insane when I first heard about them, and this one genuinely sounds insane.

But here's where I get stuck: I don't know Leo's story. Not the business -- his story. How does a Finnish electrical engineer end up in San Francisco trying to reinvent how humans breathe underwater? What happened to him? The dossier tells me he's the youngest person in Finland to earn the highest national electrical certification, that he's a military veteran and certified diver, a two-time founder. Those are credentials, and they're impressive ones -- especially the prodigy signal on the certification. He clearly has the technical chops for what is fundamentally an electrical engineering problem. But credentials aren't what I invest on. I invest on the biographical thread that connects this person to this specific problem so deeply that they won't quit when the inevitable crises hit. I backed Travis Kalanick because I could feel his gravitas about the taxi medallion racket. I backed Contraline because its founder had spent years in the academic wilderness on male contraception when everyone told him it was a dead end. With Leo, I see relevant expertise but I can't yet see the personal stake -- the "why this, why now, why you" that goes beyond capability into obsession.

The technical risk here is also different from what I usually take on. I've said before that I look for "technology risk, but not insurmountable technology risk." The question I'd ask Leo directly: has anyone independently validated that portable electrolysis can generate sufficient oxygen flow for a human breathing at 200 meters depth? That's not just an engineering challenge -- it's a physics and materials question about membrane performance under extreme pressure, about managing hydrogen gas (which is explosive) inches from an oxygen-breathing diver, about battery energy density supporting sustained electrolysis. The triple-redundant electrolyzer and quadruple-redundant circuitry design tells me he's thinking seriously about failure modes, which is the right instinct for life-critical hardware. But I'd want to see test data. In a working prototype at any depth. Because if the electrolysis rate can't keep up with human oxygen consumption at depth, the whole premise fails -- and the diver dies. This isn't a software bug you can patch.

The bull case is genuinely compelling and I want to name it clearly. If this technology works, DAIVIN! isn't a dive gear company -- it's a portable life-support platform. The tagline says "sea, land, and space," and that's not hyperbole. Defense applications for special operations divers, submarine rescue, firefighter breathing apparatus, space exploration life support -- the TAM explodes beyond the $1-2 billion recreational diving market into something much larger. The defense categorization on YC makes sense: military divers carrying heavy tanks on covert operations would pay almost anything for a lightweight vest that generates oxygen from surrounding water. And this is exactly the kind of regulated, hard space I'm drawn to -- the regulatory moat of certifying a novel life-support system would take any competitor years to replicate. If Leo can demonstrate a working prototype at meaningful depth and navigate the certification pathway, he could own a category that doesn't exist yet. That's the kind of bet I wrote the SpaceX check on -- a category-defining infrastructure play where the technology risk is real but the reward is generational.

What holds me back is the solo founder dimension. I'm not worried about co-founder conflict here -- my HQ Trivia lesson doesn't apply when there's no co-founder to conflict with. But building hardware that spans electrochemistry, mechanical engineering, materials science, embedded systems, and life-safety certification as a team of one? That's not a red flag about interpersonal dynamics; it's a question about whether one person has enough hours in the day and enough diverse expertise to push through the engineering challenges that will surface. The best hardware founders I've backed have had complementary partners who could divide the problem space. Leo might be exceptional enough to pull this off alone -- the youngest-certified-in-Finland signal suggests he's not an ordinary engineer -- but I'd want to see him building a team before I'd write a check.

This sits in a space I find genuinely exciting but where I lack enough signal to move to conviction. The weirdness factor is off the charts -- this is exactly the kind of idea that most investors would dismiss as science fiction, which is usually my strongest buy signal. The founder has relevant credentials in the right technical domain. The regulatory complexity would create a real moat. But I can't find the biographical thread that tells me Leo will persist through years of engineering failures and regulatory battles, and I can't find any technical validation that the core physics actually works at the claimed specifications. I'd want to have a long conversation with Leo -- not about the technology, about his life -- and I'd want to see even a crude prototype working at depth before moving forward. The potential here is real, but so is the gap between potential and proof.
