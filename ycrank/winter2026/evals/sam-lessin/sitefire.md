# sitefire -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that jumped out at me before I even got to the founders: Peec AI has already raised $29 million, has $4M+ ARR, and 1,300 brands onboarded. Otterly.AI has 20,000 users. There are at least five named competitors building essentially the same category. When a YC W26 company enters a space where a competitor closed a $21 million Series A two months ago, I'm not looking at a non-consensus bet — I'm looking at a market that's already been priced by the venture ecosystem. The "insane idea" premium has been fully arbitraged away. GEO is the opposite of contrarian; it's the most obvious next thing in martech. Every marketing team in the world is asking "how do we show up in ChatGPT?" and every VC with a pulse is funding companies to answer that question. This is a sane idea pursued by sane people, which in my framework is the configuration with the worst expected returns.

The founders are clearly sharp — Jochen's TUM PhD with Stanford reinforcement learning research and Vincent's serial entrepreneurship starting at 18 with experience across robotics and healthcare show real technical horsepower. Their prior co-founding relationship through pulse Energy is a genuine positive; these aren't accelerator speed-daters. But here's what nags me: neither founder has documented experience in marketing, SEO, or content strategy. They're ML researchers building a marketing tool. The technical chops transfer to understanding how LLMs select citations, sure, but the go-to-market motion in enterprise marketing requires understanding buyer personas, agency dynamics, and content workflows at a level that academic optimization research doesn't provide. Contrast this with Teamshares, where the founders had deep operational experience in the exact domain they were disrupting. Domain expertise isn't everything, but when you're entering a crowded market against competitors who already have it, the gap matters more.

Now let me run the AI kill test, and this is where sitefire really struggles against my framework. My core thesis is that software moats are dissolving because AI commoditizes development. Sitefire doesn't just have a software moat — software built on AI platforms IS the entire business. Strip away the AI component and ask: would this business exist if large language models didn't? The answer is obviously no. This is the polar opposite of my "cherry on top" sweet spot. There's no physical-world operation, no installed hardware, no regulatory position, no protocol-layer lock-in. The dossier itself states "No strong moat signals found in public sources." The content generation differentiator — synthesizing AI-optimized blog posts and delivering them to CMS — is a feature that any competitor with API access to the same models can replicate in a sprint cycle. Worse, the entire analytical surface is unstable: when OpenAI ships a new model version or Google restructures AI Overviews, the optimization patterns Sitefire has learned may become worthless overnight. Building on someone else's continuously shifting platform isn't just risky — it's structurally indefensible.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. BMW, Xtrackers, and DWS are real enterprise logos at pre-seed, and that's not nothing — serious German enterprises don't typically pilot tools from two-person startups without seeing real value. If the GEO market genuinely follows the trajectory of SEO (an industry that generated tens of billions annually), the winner in this space builds an enormous business. Sitefire's "closing the loop" from analytics to content creation is a real workflow advantage over pure-monitoring competitors, and first-mover advantage in enterprise relationships can compound. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe: (1) the founders can learn the marketing domain faster than marketing-native competitors can build technical depth, (2) the analytics-to-content-creation integration creates enough switching cost to defend against Peec AI's $29M war chest, and (3) AI citation patterns stabilize enough to build durable optimization intelligence. I find each of these assumptions individually plausible but collectively unlikely in a market moving this fast with this many well-capitalized players.

What I keep coming back to is the protocol-versus-application hierarchy. Sitefire is an application layer on top of other companies' platforms. It cannot become a primitive that others build on. There are no network effects — one customer's usage doesn't make the product better for another customer in any structural way (the inferred "proprietary data" moat is speculative and would require enormous scale to matter). This caps the infinity story. "Marketing suite for the agentic web" is a reasonable narrative, but it's a tool narrative, not a platform narrative. Tools get acquired or outcompeted; platforms compound. And when I look at the market structure — incumbents like Semrush and Ahrefs with massive existing customer bases, new entrants like Peec AI with 15x the funding — I see a company entering a footrace where the starting gun fired a year ago and several runners are already around the first turn.
