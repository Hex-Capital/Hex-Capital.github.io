# Return Signals -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Return Signals is the trajectory of its technical founder. Ilya Valmianski built SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente -- a genuinely impressive patient-facing ML deployment trained on 25 million primary care encounters. He then founded MDandMe, a conversational symptom checker, raising $2 million in mid-2023. By 2025, he surfaces at a company called Material Model doing business as Return Signals -- an AI concierge for e-commerce returns. This is a founder who built a powerful capability (conversational AI for troubleshooting) and went looking for a market to attach it to. The MDandMe timeline -- founded February 2023, funded June 2023, apparently abandoned by 2025 -- suggests a company that didn't work, followed by a lateral search for a better application domain. My highest-conviction investments go to founders who are drawn into a market by a deep secret they've discovered about how that market works, not founders who possess a hammer and are surveying the landscape for nails. Zuckerberg understood social identity because he lived inside it. Karp understood intelligence analysis because he studied the epistemological problems of large-data synthesis. Valmianski understands conversational AI, which is a real skill, but he does not appear to possess any proprietary insight about e-commerce, returns, or the DTC ecosystem.

What is the secret here? Return Signals claims that proactive SMS outreach before a customer initiates a return -- checking in after delivery and steering toward exchanges -- is fundamentally superior to the reactive return portals offered by Loop, Narvar, and AfterShip. But "it's better to prevent returns than to process them" is not a truth that most smart people actively reject. It is obvious. Every merchant in the world knows that returns destroy margins. The question has always been execution: can you actually intercept return intent at scale and redirect it? The answer Return Signals offers -- an LLM-powered SMS agent -- became technically feasible in 2023-2024 because of foundation model improvements, not because of any proprietary breakthrough from this team. The underlying components are commercially available: Twilio for SMS, OpenAI or Anthropic for the language model, Shopify's API for integration. The 70% exchange conversion rate is interesting if verified, but it is a tuning achievement within a standard technology stack, not a 10x discontinuity that creates structural barriers. Any competent ML team could replicate this product in a quarter.

The competitive landscape is where this falls apart completely. Loop Returns has raised $176 million and serves 5,000+ brands. Narvar processes 74 billion consumer interactions annually through its AI layer. AfterShip generates $85 million in revenue. These are not sleepy incumbents waiting to be disrupted -- they are well-capitalized platforms that are actively adding AI capabilities. Return Signals' differentiation is proactive outbound SMS versus reactive self-serve portals. That is a feature, not a category. Loop could add an SMS outreach module by next quarter. Narvar, with its existing IRIS AI infrastructure and enterprise relationships, could test proactive post-delivery messaging as a line item on its product roadmap. When the differentiation between your company and an incumbent can be expressed as a single product feature, you are not building a monopoly -- you are building a feature that will be absorbed. The returns management market has four funded players and no secret separating them. This is a Girardian landscape of mimetic convergence, where companies will increasingly imitate each other's tactics, including this one.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the conversational AI layer creates a compounding data advantage -- that each exchange interaction trains the model to handle the next one better, creating a flywheel that incumbents cannot replicate. If the 95% positive sentiment and the "personal relationships with the bot" claims are real at scale, and if this translates into measurable merchant retention, then Return Signals might develop switching costs that resemble what Palantir built with government clients -- deep integration that compounds over years. The apparel niche is a smart beachhead; sizing and fit drive disproportionate return rates, making the proactive troubleshooting mechanism most valuable exactly where the pain is sharpest. If Valmianski can demonstrate a verifiable 5-10% margin uplift for DTC apparel brands, the product would sell itself through case studies alone. But for this to be a power-law outcome -- a company that returns the fund -- it would need to evolve from a returns intervention tool into a broader post-purchase relationship platform that captures an entirely new category. I see no evidence that the founders have articulated that definite vision. They describe themselves as a luxury concierge for returns, which is a product description, not a theory of the future.

The small-market entry through apparel DTC brands makes tactical sense, and the SOC 2 certification shows operational seriousness for a pre-seed company. But these are execution signals, not monopoly signals. Return Signals is a competent application of generally available AI technology to a real but well-understood problem, entering a market with multiple well-funded competitors, built by a technically strong founder who does not appear to possess domain-specific conviction about e-commerce. There is no secret here that I can identify -- no contrarian truth that would make the incumbents' approaches structurally obsolete. This is a 1-to-n business dressed in AI language: a better version of something that already exists, not something that did not exist before. I pass.
