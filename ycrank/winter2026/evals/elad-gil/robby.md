# Robby -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Robby is that this "boring" market has already been found. Home services AI fits my archetype perfectly -- HVAC technician enablement is exactly the kind of unsexy, dismissed-by-VCs market where I've historically found asymmetric returns. PagerDuty was "too boring," Gusto was "too boring," Samsara was "too physical." But the defining feature of those investments was that the market looked boring *to other investors at the time I wrote the check*. Here, Netic has already raised $43M at a $450M valuation with 1,700% revenue growth backed by Founders Fund and Greylock. Housecall Pro shipped "CSR AI" and "Coach AI" features in fall 2025. Arch has Coatue backing for AI-driven outbound in the same vertical. ServiceTitan IPO'd at $8.45B in December 2024 with a war chest to build or acquire anything in this space. When I count five-plus funded competitors pursuing AI for home services revenue optimization, I'm no longer looking at a non-obvious market -- I'm looking at a market that was non-obvious eighteen months ago and is now consensus.

The structural moment is real but undifferentiated. LLM capabilities crossing the threshold for real-time technician coaching and automated lead scoring from unstructured job data -- that's a genuine capability inflection that didn't exist cost-effectively two to three years ago. But unlike Harvey, where legal AI had no incumbent platform competitor and the capability gap was being closed by foundation model labs on Harvey's behalf, here the same LLM capability is simultaneously available to ServiceTitan's engineering team, to Housecall Pro (which has already shipped), and to Netic (which is much better capitalized). When the structural moment empowers everyone at once, the advantage accrues to whoever already owns the customer relationship and data -- which is the incumbent FSM platform, not the overlay.

The product-to-distribution trajectory concerns me structurally. Robby appears to integrate with existing FSM platforms -- the website references syncing to "office systems." This means Robby is building a revenue-optimization layer on top of ServiceTitan's infrastructure rather than replacing it. Compare this to Gusto, which built a full-stack payroll product that *replaced* ADP and Paychex for small businesses, owning the entire customer relationship. Gusto's distribution expanded naturally into HR, benefits, and compliance because it owned the system of record. Robby shares the customer relationship with the FSM platform it sits on top of. That creates both platform dependency risk (ServiceTitan can restrict API access) and a distribution ceiling -- it's harder to become a multi-product platform when someone else owns the workflow backbone. The "command center" for GMs is a second surface, but I don't see evidence the founders have articulated how the initial product becomes a channel for adjacent offerings.

The bull case deserves a full accounting. Nine named paying customers at pre-seed is genuinely impressive execution. The "$40k in new business within an hour" testimonial and "$135k additional revenue per technician per year" claim -- if those numbers hold at scale -- represent a product with unambiguous, quantifiable ROI. Products that clearly pay for themselves in week one are rare. The team's domain immersion is also notable: riding along with dozens of technicians, shadowing every office role, and pursuing EPA 608 certification goes well beyond what I typically see from MBA founders entering an unfamiliar industry. If the data loop from technician visits genuinely compounds -- each visit generating equipment and customer data that improves recommendations -- then Robby could build a proprietary data asset that differentiates against both incumbents and competitors over time. And the specific wedge of "in-field technician enablement" is genuinely differentiated from Netic (pre-visit calls and marketing) and Arch (outbound campaigns). If Robby can own the technician's in-field experience, that could become infrastructure. But that's a big "if" when Housecall Pro's Coach AI is targeting the same interaction point.

What holds me back is the single-miracle test. The product spans lead generation, pre-job context, real-time technical assistance, job documentation, and follow-up coaching -- five distinct capabilities. When I look for the one sentence that describes Robby's critical obstacle, I can't find it. Is the miracle getting technicians to adopt AI tools during service calls? Is it building a data moat from visit documentation? Is it winning distribution against a competitor with twenty times their capital? Broadness at this stage usually means the team hasn't yet identified the one thing that has to work. The pivot from customs/imports AI (Importrix) also signals recent arrival -- they "evaluated multiple industries" before landing on home services, which is honest but means their structural insight into this market is months old, not years deep. Joe Schwarzmann's Bain consulting background in home services PE gives them a faster path to domain understanding than most pivoting teams, and the traction suggests they've learned quickly. But against Netic's velocity and ServiceTitan's resources, I need more conviction that Robby has identified a specific structural wedge that only they can occupy.
