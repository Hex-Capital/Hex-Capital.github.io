# Ressl AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Ressl AI is that this space is getting crowded -- and fast. Netic has $43M from Founders Fund and Greylock at a $450M valuation with 1,700% revenue growth. Avoca is YC-backed with real revenue. ServiceTitan, now public, is shipping AI voice agents and SMS booking features into its existing install base. When I see a category where multiple well-capitalized players are already racing, the contrarian signal I depend on isn't just weak -- it's inverted. The most promising companies are not popular. AI agents for trades businesses is rapidly becoming very popular. This is the kind of market where consensus has already formed, and by the time consensus forms, the opportunity for an outsider angel check has usually passed. I want to be early, before the world agrees, and the world is already agreeing here.

If I could sit down with Arushi, my first question would be the one I always ask: tell me your story, not the business. What I can piece together from public sources shows a technically impressive young founder -- Manipal IT, Microsoft intern, Google Scholar, 15+ hackathons with a 33% win rate, four early-stage startup internships, a CRM company she built for VCs and PEs during college. That's real execution energy. But I'm listening for the biographical thread that ties this person to this specific problem, and I can't find it. She didn't grow up around collision shops. She doesn't have family running an HVAC business. The connection to trades came through consulting -- "an AI consulting firm talking to businesses across every industry" before landing on trades as the segment with the most glue work. That's smart market analysis, but it's not the kind of lived-experience conviction that sustains a founder through years of selling to skeptical shop owners in strip malls. When I backed the Crusoe team, their story of independently discovering that stranded gas could power computation was inseparable from who they were. I need that fusion of person and problem, and I don't see it here.

There is a genuine bull case I want to take seriously. The "glue worker" insight is real -- I've walked into enough small businesses to know that the person answering phones, copying estimates into QuickBooks, and chasing parts vendors is the operational backbone that software has failed to replace. The PE roll-up distribution channel is genuinely clever, and Arushi's prior experience building CRMs for VCs and PEs gives her credibility with those buyers in a way that connects to her actual biography. One PE relationship could unlock dozens of locations, and PE firms have the financial discipline to measure headcount reduction against software cost with precision. If the team can nail one sub-vertical -- say collision repair with CCCOne integration -- and prove that a single Ressl agent replaces a $45K/year glue worker, the pull-through across a PE portfolio could be fast. And they demonstrated real execution by generating $440K in revenue on their prior Salesforce product. Walking away from revenue to pursue something bigger takes a certain kind of courage.

But the pivot itself gives me pause. $440K isn't trivial -- it's meaningful early-stage revenue, and they left it behind. Either they saw something so compelling in trades that the Salesforce business felt small, or they followed the heat toward a trending category. The dossier describes them as starting with consulting before landing on trades, which sounds more like market discovery than biographical inevitability. Meanwhile, Netic has a 12-month head start, Founders Fund backing (my former colleagues know this space), and 1,700% revenue growth. ServiceTitan has the distribution and the customer relationships. The underlying technology -- LLM agents calling APIs -- isn't structurally defensible. Each sub-vertical uses different core systems, so horizontal expansion requires significant integration engineering per vertical. This is a race where capital matters, and $500-750K against $43M is a difficult position.

I keep coming back to Thumbtack, which is in my portfolio and created real economic access for skilled tradespeople. There's a version of Ressl that does something similar -- making small, independently-owned shops competitive with PE-consolidated giants by giving them the same operational efficiency. That's the impact story that would excite me. But the primary GTM here runs through PE roll-ups seeking margin improvement, which is about cutting headcount at acquired businesses, not empowering the independent operator. The economic access narrative runs in both directions, and the direction they're pointing isn't the one that gives me that jolt of intuitive energy. This is competent founders in a real market building something that works, but it doesn't carry the signal I invest on -- no biographical inevitability, no non-consensus weirdness, no regulatory moat that keeps well-funded competitors at bay. I'd want to meet Arushi and hear her story directly, because the public record may be missing something essential. But on what I can see, this isn't my kind of bet.
