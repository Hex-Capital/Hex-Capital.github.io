# Arzule -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumped out at me isn't the product or the market -- it's the pivot. There's a PyPI package called `arzule-ingest` with fifty releases, and it's a multi-agent trace capture SDK for CrewAI, LangChain, and AutoGen. That's an entirely different product from B2B partnership intelligence. The GitHub repo returns a 404. When I see a company that's shipped fifty versions of one thing and then shows up at YC with something completely different, my first instinct isn't judgment -- it's curiosity. What happened? What did you learn? What made you walk away from all that work? But without hearing that story directly, what I'm left with is a signal that concerns me: founders who may be searching for a problem rather than solving one that lives inside them.

And that's really where this falls apart for me. When I sit down with founders, I want to hear the story before the business. I want to understand how you got here -- not the pitch, but the biography. Jeffrey and Nikhil are clearly sharp. NYU Math and CS, UChicago Math, Econ, and CS -- quantitative minds, strong technical foundations. Jeffrey built a multi-agent sports betting arbitrage system. Nikhil bypassed Google OAuth to automate data annotation. These are the kinds of technical feats that tell me they can build things. But when I ask the question I always ask -- why this specific problem, why B2B partnerships -- I don't find an answer anywhere in their story. Neither founder has worked in partnerships, channel sales, or SaaS ecosystem management. There's no biographical thread connecting them to the pain they're describing. That absence is the loudest signal in this dossier for me. The founders I back are people who couldn't not build their company because the problem was forged into who they are.

The product itself is sensible. I'll give it that. Partnership discovery is genuinely manual and broken, and the incumbents -- Crossbeam, PartnerStack -- are focused downstream on managing relationships that already exist. There's a real gap in the workflow. The bull case here is that Arzule becomes the intelligence layer that sits upstream of the entire partner ecosystem, the way ZoomInfo sits upstream of sales. If these founders can nail the AI-driven signal detection and build enough proprietary data through their karma system and network effects, they could define a category. The timing is plausible too -- LLMs just crossed the quality threshold for parsing unstructured ecosystem signals at scale. If I squint, I can see a version of this that works. But "if I squint" has never been how I invest. I'm looking for the jolt, the visceral feeling that something extraordinary is happening. I didn't feel it here.

What I notice that a more analytically-minded investor might miss is this: Arzule doesn't make anything invisible visible in a way that matters to real people. When I backed Affirm, the insight was that credit card companies were hiding fees from consumers who couldn't afford to be surprised. When I backed Flock Safety, it was about communities having access to safety data that had been hoarded by institutions. Those companies created transparency where opacity was causing harm. Arzule creates efficiency for SaaS partnership teams -- people who already have salaries, tools, and resources. It's a productivity optimization for a narrow, well-served buyer persona. That's not a moral failing, but it's not my kind of bet. I invest in things that expand who gets to participate in the economy, and I don't see that here.

The broader concern is that "AI agents scanning public data to surface insights" is probably the single most consensus approach in the current market. Every B2B SaaS pitch I see right now involves autonomous agents monitoring signals. This is the opposite of unpopular and difficult to assess -- it's popular and easy to understand, which in my experience means the alpha has already been arbitraged away. The commoditization risk the dossier identifies is real: ZoomInfo, 6sense, even Crossbeam itself could add this capability as a feature. There's no regulatory moat, no stigma keeping competitors away, no capital intensity creating a barrier. The defensibility story rests on data compounding over time, but at pre-seed with no traction, that's a hope, not a moat.

I'm passing. These are capable builders who may find something that resonates, but this particular configuration -- domain-outsider founders, a recent pivot, a consensus AI approach, a narrow B2B workflow optimization without broader impact -- doesn't activate anything in my framework. I wish them well, and if one of them comes back in two years with something born from a personal obsession, I'd take the meeting in a heartbeat.
