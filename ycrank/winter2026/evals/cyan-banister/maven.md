# Maven -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Maven is what's missing from the story. When I look at two UC Berkeley engineers who both came through Amazon, I see technically capable people — but I don't see a biographical thread that connects them to payments, to voice infrastructure, to the frustration of watching an AI phone call fail because it can't take a credit card number. I would want to sit across from Wasi and Brandon and ask them: how did you get *here*? What happened in your life that made you wake up one morning and decide that payment routing for AI voice agents was your problem to solve? The dossier gives me hackathon organizing and a course scheduling tool — both impressive for their age — but nothing that tells me these founders have been living inside the problem they're building for. That absence is the loudest signal in this entire evaluation. The founders who persist through the inevitable crises are the ones whose commitment was forged by something personal, and I can't see that here.

The second thing that gives me pause is the consensus factor. AI infrastructure is the most popular investment category in Silicon Valley right now. Every fund, every angel, every accelerator is looking for picks-and-shovels plays in the AI stack. Maven is a sensible, logical product — "payments for AI voice agents" is a real gap at a real inflection point. But sensible and logical aren't the signals I've trained myself to follow. The companies that have returned the most for me — SpaceX when everyone said private rockets were delusional, Uber when ride-sharing was literally illegal — those were the ones that made people uncomfortable. Maven doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. It makes people nod and say "that makes sense." When every investor nods, the price is usually wrong and the upside has already been competed away.

I do want to engage genuinely with the bull case, because there's a version of this that works. PCI-DSS compliance is a real operational barrier — it's expensive, it's tedious, and maintaining certification is an ongoing burden. If the voice AI agent market really does explode from $2.4 billion to $47.5 billion over the next decade, and if these platforms remain architecturally open, then Maven could become the default payment rail for AI-initiated transactions. That's a Stripe-for-voice-AI analogy, and it's not crazy. The platform-agnostic positioning across VAPI, Retell, LiveKit, and Twilio is smart — it mirrors Stripe's early strategy of being everywhere developers already were. And the founders clearly can ship: Berkeleytime is a real production application, the hackathon scaling to 2,900 participants shows operational chops. If I squint, I can see the path. But here's what breaks it for me: the voice AI platforms themselves are venture-backed, feature-hungry, and incentivized to own the payment layer. Twilio already has `<Pay>`. VAPI or Retell adding native payments is a product sprint, not a moonshot. Maven is filling a gap that might close as these platforms mature — and that's a timing arbitrage, not a defensible company.

There's also a dimension I always look for that's entirely absent here: does this company create economic access for people who need it? Uber put money in drivers' pockets. Postmates gave delivery workers a new income stream. Affirm made credit transparent for people getting gouged by hidden fees. Maven helps businesses collect payments from customers during automated phone calls — in verticals like collections and healthcare billing, that's actually on the other side of the equation from economic empowerment. It's efficiency infrastructure for the collecting entity, not a tool that opens doors for underserved people. That doesn't make it a bad business, but it means this particular company doesn't light up the part of my framework that connects capitalism to real-world impact.

The co-founder dynamic reads as neutral — shared Berkeley and Amazon background suggests they know each other, which is better than strangers meeting at a co-founder matching event. But I don't see evidence of stress-testing, and for a company that will need to navigate PCI compliance, payment gateway politics, and platform dependency risk without prior fintech experience, the team's resilience matters enormously. Neither founder has publicly documented experience in payments or compliance, and that's the kind of domain gap that can quietly become an existential problem when you're handling real card data at scale.

I'm passing on Maven. These are smart, capable founders building a reasonable product at a genuine inflection point — and none of that activates the part of me that writes checks. I need the biographical conviction, the weirdness that makes other investors look away, and the sense that this company exists because these specific humans couldn't *not* build it. What I see instead is a well-identified market opportunity pursued by talented engineers. That's a fine company. It's just not my kind of bet.
