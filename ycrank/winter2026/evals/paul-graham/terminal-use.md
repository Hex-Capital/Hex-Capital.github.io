# Terminal Use -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Terminal Use is the competitive landscape, and it's alarming. They've positioned themselves as "Vercel for background agents" at the exact moment Vercel itself has launched agent hosting with Fluid compute, agent SDKs, and an open ecosystem called Skills.sh. E2B has $21M and claims 88% of the Fortune 100 signed up. Daytona hit $1M ARR in under three months on $31M in funding. Modal Labs is raising at a $2.5B valuation. When I look at the AI infrastructure space in early 2026, I see a category where every VC is writing checks and every platform company is expanding. I wrote last year that the most impressive YC companies I'd seen were not working on AI. That observation applies here with particular force. This isn't schlep blindness territory -- it's consensus territory. The problem of deploying agents to production is visible to everyone. Nobody is unconsciously filtering it out. They're all racing toward it with open checkbooks.

The founders do have a genuine connection to this problem, which is the one thing that keeps me from an immediate pass. All three worked at Palantir. Vivek Raja led the technical delivery of one of the largest agent use cases across US hospitals. That's not someone who read a TechCrunch article about agentic AI and brainstormed for two weeks. He was in the room deploying agents at enterprise scale, hitting the walls, dealing with the filesystem state management problems, the crash recovery, the memory issues. Stavros built infrastructure for developer tooling at Palantir. Filip worked on Foundry's ontology layer. There's an authentic thread from their work experience to the product they're building now. But there's an important gap between "I deployed agents at Palantir's scale" and "I'm building the platform every developer needs to deploy their agents." Palantir's agent deployment challenges are specific to Palantir's heavily managed, enterprise context. The translation to a general-purpose developer tool is a real leap, and it's the kind of leap that can introduce subtle misunderstandings about what the broader market actually needs.

Where I get stuck is the schlep test. Container orchestration, filesystem isolation, Docker automation, CLI tooling -- these are well-understood infrastructure patterns. The dossier says so explicitly. When Stripe tackled payments, the schlep was regulatory hell: dealing with banks, compliance, fraud detection across jurisdictions, PCI requirements. That kind of pain creates a moat because it's genuinely miserable work that takes years to get right, and nobody wants to replicate it. The schlep in agent orchestration is engineering work, and it's the kind of engineering work that a team of good infrastructure engineers at any of these well-funded competitors can build in months. The core technical components are commodity. The differentiation is in the opinionated combination -- build, eval, deploy, A/B test -- but opinionated combinations are replicable by anyone with capital and taste.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: the agentic AI market is genuinely enormous and moving fast. Filesystem-heavy background agents are a specific architectural pattern that general platforms serve poorly -- Vercel's serverless model wasn't built for persistent processes, E2B's ephemeral sandboxes don't handle lifecycle, Modal is raw compute without opinions. There's a real gap for an opinionated, purpose-built platform. These three Palantir engineers understand the problem from the inside, they've shipped a working product, and their co-founder relationships are the real kind -- university plus years working together, not a co-founder dating site. If the agent ecosystem evolves toward long-running filesystem-bound processes as the dominant pattern, Terminal Use could be the natural home for that workload. For this to work, though, two things would need to be true: the filesystem-heavy agent pattern would need to become dominant rather than a niche, and Terminal Use would need to build distribution fast enough that switching costs accumulate before the well-funded competitors notice. Both are possible. Neither is probable enough for me to write a check.

The absence of any traction signal compounds my concern. Zero stars on GitHub. No community. No public users. No revenue. No waitlist. At pre-seed, I don't demand revenue, but I do look for any organic pull -- developers finding the tool and using it because they need it. The fact that competitors like Daytona reached $1M ARR in under three months tells me demand exists in this space. The fact that Terminal Use shows zero evidence of capturing any of that demand, even informally, is not a timing issue -- it's an adoption signal worth noting. Their self-dogfooding claim -- that they use Terminal Use to build Terminal Use -- is the minimum, not a credential.

The team is technically solid. They can build. Three Palantir engineers with CS degrees from Edinburgh and Thessaloniki, with real infrastructure experience. I'd score them well on the "can they write the code" test. But technical ability is table stakes in infrastructure. The question for an infrastructure startup is whether you can build something that developers discover organically, get addicted to, and build their workflows around before the incumbents ship their version. I don't see evidence of that dynamic forming here.
