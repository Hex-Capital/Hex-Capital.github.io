# o11 -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with o11: AI tools for investment bankers is possibly the most consensus category in venture capital right now. Hebbia has raised $161 million. Rogo has $165 million and J.P. Morgan on the cap table. AlphaSense has raised over a billion dollars. Every firm I talk to has a "finance AI" deal they're excited about. And that's the problem -- when every investor in town wants a piece of a category, the weirdness has been completely arbitraged out. The best investments I've made were the ones other people thought were insane. SpaceX when everyone said private space was a vanity project. Crusoe when people laughed at the idea of mining Bitcoin on gas flares. Uber when regulators were actively trying to shut it down. I look for that pocket of dreamers that everyone else is dismissing, and AI-for-capital-markets in 2026 is the opposite of dismissed -- it's the belle of the ball.

When I sit down with founders, the first thing I want to hear is their story -- not the pitch, not the TAM slide, but the path that brought them to this exact problem. Why does this person need to solve this particular thing? And with Aryah and Ajay, what I see is two very smart young people -- 19, 20 years old -- from UNC who are building for investment bankers and PE professionals. But neither of them has ever been an investment banker or worked at a PE shop. There's no documented moment of personal frustration with pitch decks at 2 AM, no biographical thread connecting them to the specific agony of building LBO models in Excel. Aryah is a Morehead-Cain Scholar from San Mateo with a string of prior startup attempts, none with traction that I can see. That profile reads less like someone who has to solve this problem and more like someone who spotted a hot market and moved fast. I've learned through painful experience -- GameCrush, and others -- that the founders who are chasing what's popular rather than what's personal tend not to have the reserves to push through when things get ugly.

I want to give credit where it's genuinely earned. Ajay's experience leading AI at Cal AI -- a product that scaled to 10 million users and $40 million in ARR -- is not nothing. That's real engineering at real scale, and it tells me he can build products people use. The M365-embedded strategy is also a legitimately interesting distribution insight. Hebbia and Rogo built standalone platforms, but bankers actually live in Excel and PowerPoint, and meeting them there reduces the friction that kills enterprise adoption. If this insight compounds -- if o11 becomes the default AI layer inside M365 for finance the way Salesforce extensions became default for CRM -- there's a version of this company that works. The 150 reviews at 4.8 stars and logos from Wells Fargo and Bank of America suggest real humans at serious institutions are finding enough value to keep using the product. For the bull case to play out, though, you'd need Microsoft to stay horizontal with Copilot for years (unlikely given they've identified financial services as their highest-concentration AI vertical), and you'd need Rogo and Hebbia to never build M365 plugins, which is a feature sprint for well-funded engineering teams.

The dimension of my framework where this company scores lowest is economic access and real-world impact. The people who build pitch decks at Goldman Sachs are some of the most well-compensated professionals on the planet. Making their workflow 30% faster doesn't create economic opportunity for anyone who currently lacks it, doesn't make an invisible system visible, doesn't open a door that was closed. When I backed Uber, the story wasn't just about riders getting places faster -- it was about Roger, my driver, and millions of people like him suddenly having a way to earn a living on their own terms. When I backed Affirm, it was about transparent credit for people who'd been trapped by hidden fees. I need to feel that a company is doing something that matters for people who don't already have everything, and I don't feel that here.

The platform dependency also concerns me in a way that goes beyond standard risk assessment. Building your entire product as add-ins inside another company's ecosystem -- especially Microsoft's -- means your survival is a policy decision away from extinction. Microsoft announced Copilot pricing changes effective July 2026. One API deprecation, one change to the add-in marketplace terms, and o11's distribution channel evaporates. That's not a technology risk I find compelling; it's a dependency risk where the downside isn't under the founders' control. The founders I back tend to be building on ground they own, not renting someone else's platform.

I respect the ambition, and I think Ajay in particular has the technical chops to build interesting things. But this company sits at the intersection of too many patterns I avoid: a consensus-hot category that every fund is chasing, founders without a biographical connection to the specific problem, a product for the already-privileged, and platform dependency on a giant that could build or acquire the vertical functionality tomorrow. If I were sitting across from Aryah and Ajay, I'd tell them honestly -- you're talented, and the M365-embedded angle has merit, but I need to feel something weird and personal in the founding story, and I don't feel it here.
