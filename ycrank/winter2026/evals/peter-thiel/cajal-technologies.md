# Cajal -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know about the absence of a secret. Harmonic AI has raised $295 million and is valued at $1.45 billion. Axiom Math has raised $164 million at a $300 million valuation. Google DeepMind built AlphaProof. DeepSeek has released open-source Lean4 prover models. LeanDojo provides free academic toolkits. Another YC company, Theorem, raised $6 million from Khosla for an adjacent application. When I look at a market where this many well-funded, intelligent players are converging on the same technological thesis -- AI plus formal verification in Lean -- I see a Girardian convergence, not a secret. The entire space is a case study in mimetic desire: everyone watched DeepMind's AlphaProof achieve IMO silver-medal performance, everyone read about Lean 4's maturation, and everyone simultaneously decided that AI-powered theorem proving was the next frontier. The number of entrants is itself the refutation of the contrarian thesis. If every smart person in AI research agrees that formal verification is ready for its moment, then the thesis is consensus, and consensus theses do not produce monopolies.

Cajal's claimed differentiation -- targeting applied scientific domains like quantum computing and finance rather than competition mathematics -- is at best a positioning choice, not a secret. The assertion that applied formal verification will be more valuable than solving IMO problems is something any reasonable person would agree with. Axiom Math is already targeting quantitative finance. The moment Harmonic or any well-resourced player decides to pivot from competition math benchmarks to applied domains, Cajal's positioning advantage evaporates. A genuine secret would be a non-obvious truth about the world that, if correct, makes the existing approaches structurally obsolete. "Applied math matters more than competition math" is not that truth -- it is a truism that every player in this space would affirm if asked.

The founder profile deepens my concern rather than alleviating it. Both founders came through Entrepreneurs First, a co-founder matching program -- they were not two people who spent years in the formal methods community and finally saw an opening. Pedro Nobre was previously building Aptia, an AI platform for designing aptamers for cancer biomarker detection. The distance from aptamer design to formal mathematical verification is vast, and the pivot suggests a search for market opportunity rather than a burning conviction rooted in domain expertise. Neither founder has publicly documented work in theorem proving, the Lean ecosystem, or formal verification of any kind -- no publications, no open-source contributions, no prior projects. When I backed the founding of Palantir, the core insight came directly from technology we had already built at PayPal. The founders of General Matter came from SpaceX, Tesla, Anduril, and national labs -- they had lived inside the problem. Here, the connection between the founders' backgrounds (neuroscience, computer vision) and the company's domain (formal mathematical verification) is not merely undocumented -- it appears not to exist.

The strongest bull case for Cajal is the Palantir analogy: a small, focused company that builds deep integrations with specific high-stakes customers -- quantum computing labs, cryptography teams, aerospace programs -- creating switching costs through domain-specific formalization libraries that larger, more general competitors cannot replicate. If Cajal could become the trusted formal verification partner for a concentrated set of institutions where correctness is existentially important, the narrow focus could compound into an unassailable position over time. Quantum computing in particular demands mathematical rigor at a level where informal testing is genuinely insufficient, and a company that builds the verified foundation for quantum algorithms could become structurally embedded. This would require the founders to rapidly develop or acquire deep formal methods expertise, establish relationships with the small number of serious quantum computing organizations, and build proprietary formalization libraries faster than open-source alternatives. It is conceivable -- but nothing in the current evidence suggests it is underway. The product page lists datasets, evaluations, and RL environments, but no public benchmarks, demonstrations, or customer relationships are visible. The technology called "Tau" has no documented performance against any baseline.

The durability question is decisive. The Lean ecosystem is open-source. DeepSeek has released open-source Lean4 provers. LeanDojo provides free toolkits for exactly the kind of LLM-based theorem proving that Cajal claims to productize. The $10 million in new Lean ecosystem funding from Alex Gerko accelerates open-source development further. In a world where the core infrastructure is freely available and improving rapidly, Cajal's defensibility must come entirely from proprietary domain-specific formalization and customer relationships -- neither of which exists yet. A company that depends on a moat it has not begun to build, in a market where competitors have raised four hundred times more capital, is not a company with a path to monopoly. It is a company that will compete, and the outcome of that competition is predictable.
