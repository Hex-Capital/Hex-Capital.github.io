# Corelayer -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about Corelayer is how much capital has already flooded the exact space they're entering. Resolve AI closed $125M at a billion-dollar valuation two months ago. incident.io raised at $400M. BigPanda has absorbed $431M. "AI agent for on-call engineering" is not a contrarian bet in February 2026 -- it is the consensus bet. Every investor I talk to is looking at this category. When the crowd is already optimistic, your upside is capped and your downside is competing against companies with 50-100x your capital. The narrow wedge -- data-content debugging rather than infrastructure monitoring, deployed on-prem in regulated industries -- is a real differentiator. But a wedge within a consensus category is not the same as a contrarian position. It's a niche within a gold rush.

The specific knowledge question is where I spend the most time. Both founders built data infrastructure at Goldman Sachs, processing hundreds of billions of rows daily. Shipra Jha has a CMU computer science degree plus Oracle cloud infrastructure experience. That's directly relevant -- they've lived inside the failure modes of data pipelines at the exact scale and regulatory intensity they're targeting. The question is whether this knowledge is non-transferable or merely domain experience. Thousands of engineers at Goldman, JPMorgan, Citadel, and Two Sigma have debugged data pipelines at similar scale. The insight that "bad data" is structurally different from "bad infrastructure" is genuine but not deeply hidden -- it's a well-understood pain point among data engineers at any large financial firm. I don't see evidence of the kind of obsessive, years-long intellectual commitment to a specific problem that marks the founders I've backed at the earliest stage. What I see is competent engineers who recognized a real pain from their day jobs and are building a product to solve it. That's a perfectly valid founding story, but it doesn't clear the bar for knowledge that couldn't be assembled by any strong engineering team spending six months embedded at a bank.

The leverage architecture concerns me most. On-prem deployment in regulated industries means customization per customer, security reviews, compliance audits, and integration with each client's specific tool stack across 20+ platforms. The cost savings calculator on their website frames value as reducing engineer time from 20% to 6% -- that's labor replacement math, not leverage creation. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where one engineer's question and answer served millions of developers, or Replit, where one platform feature multiplied the capability of every user simultaneously. Corelayer's model scales with each enterprise contract, not exponentially across all users. In regulated industries with long sales cycles, a two-person team faces a structural mismatch between the pace of enterprise procurement and the capital efficiency that pre-seed demands. Fortune 100 financial institutions don't move in YC batch cycles.

The strongest bull case: if incumbents structurally cannot touch production data inside regulated environments -- if PagerDuty's cloud-SaaS architecture truly prevents them from building data-content inspection, and if Datadog's margin structure makes on-prem deployment economically irrational -- then Corelayer occupies a gap that won't be closed by competitive spending alone. The confidential compute angle is genuinely interesting engineering, and the founders' Goldman network provides a warm introduction path to exactly the buyers who need this capability. There's a world where Corelayer becomes indispensable to every data-heavy financial institution, with accumulated debugging context creating real switching costs over time. If two or three Fortune 100 contracts land in the next twelve months, the compounding story starts to become credible. But this requires believing that the wedge stays defensible long enough for a two-person team to build enterprise relationships that typically take years and dedicated sales infrastructure.

What I keep returning to is the absence of new leverage. The best companies I've backed didn't just solve a problem more efficiently -- they created a new category of capability that enabled people to do something they couldn't do before. Corelayer makes existing on-call engineers faster at an existing task. That's valuable, but it's optimization, not transformation. The technology itself -- LLM-powered log analysis, anomaly detection, root-cause suggestion -- is composed of individually reproducible components. When Datadog or Splunk ships similar features as a product update, and they will, the differentiation becomes purely about regulated-industry deployment posture. That's a real moat, but it's a compliance moat, not a technology moat. Compliance moats protect revenue; they don't compound it.
