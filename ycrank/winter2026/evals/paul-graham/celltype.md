# CellType -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that strikes me most about CellType is a paradox I don't see often: the founders' greatest asset is simultaneously their greatest vulnerability. David van Dijk co-developed the core technology with Google DeepMind, got it amplified by Sundar Pichai to 7 million people, and published it at ICML. That's extraordinary for a pre-seed company. But the Cell2Sentence methodology is published, the code has 809 stars on GitHub, and the trained 27B-parameter models are on Hugging Face for anyone to download. Meanwhile, Google's own drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, has $600 million and partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis. CellType built their credibility by giving away the store, and their most powerful collaborator owns a direct competitor. That's not a standard pre-seed risk profile. It's a structural tension that determines whether this company can exist independently at all.

On the organic test, CellType passes clearly. Van Dijk didn't read a TechCrunch article about AI drug discovery and decide to start a company. He's been living inside computational single-cell biology for his entire career -- he created MAGIC (Cell, 2018) and PHATE (Nature Biotechnology, 2019), two foundational tools in the field. Cell2Sentence grew out of his Yale lab. The insight that gene expression data could be serialized into language sequences that LLMs can reason about -- that's the kind of idea that takes years of domain immersion to even formulate. He turned down Google to build this. When a tenured Yale professor with an NSF CAREER Award walks away from both academia and a Google offer, the conviction is real. This is not a manufactured startup idea. But organic origin and schlep willingness are not the same thing. Drug discovery is a genuine schlep -- regulatory complexity, biological uncertainty, decade-long timelines. The problem is that this particular schlep is not hidden. It's one of the hottest categories in venture capital. Isomorphic has $600M. Recursion has $461M. Insilico has $525M and just IPO'd. Valo has $400M and multi-billion-dollar Novo Nordisk and Merck partnerships. When I said the most impressive YC companies I've seen recently are not working on AI, this is exactly the dynamic I meant. AI drug discovery is consensus. Everyone agrees it's a big opportunity, which means the upside has already been partially priced by the flood of capital.

Where I struggle is the evidence of user pull. The YC page says they're "working with Top 10 pharma" with "100% inbound" deal generation. But no pharma company is named. No revenue is mentioned. No LOIs, no contract values, no pilot outcomes. In my experience, "working with" large enterprises often means "having meetings with people who are paid to evaluate vendors." The inbound interest is almost certainly driven by the Google DeepMind halo and the Pichai amplification, not by independent product-market pull. The claim of screening 4,000+ drugs and discovering a novel cancer treatment signal is interesting as research output, but it's pre-clinical and not peer-reviewed as a full discovery pipeline. That's a very long distance from the kind of demand signal I look for -- users who would be genuinely harmed if the product disappeared tomorrow.

The strongest bull case is that van Dijk's technical credibility is nearly impossible to replicate. 8,895 citations, foundational methods in the field, a Google DeepMind collaboration, and now a working 27B-parameter biological foundation model. If the "virtual human" approach actually works -- if LLMs reasoning about cellular biology can predict drug responses with sufficient accuracy -- this is foundational infrastructure that every pharmaceutical company needs. The pharma partnerships would come not from sales effort but from scientific gravity. And the agentic orchestration layer, pharma-specific fine-tuning, and proprietary validation datasets could provide the defensibility that the open-source base models lack. Van Dijk may be uniquely positioned to build this because he understands both the biology and the computation at a level that pure ML engineers or pure biologists cannot match. If I'm wrong about the crowded category concern -- if CellType's cellular-level approach is genuinely differentiated from Isomorphic's protein-folding approach and Recursion's phenomic screening -- then this could be the Stripe of drug discovery: obvious problem, painful execution, and everyone else working at the wrong layer of abstraction.

Both founders are genuinely technical, and that matters to me. Van Dijk wrote the research code. Vrkic built software for CERN's Large Hadron Collider and was a founding engineer training foundation models at a biotech company. They co-built Cell2Sentence together at Yale. These are hackers who made the thing, not managers who hired people to make it. On the "animal test" -- would I describe them as animals at their craft -- van Dijk's publication record says yes. But I see no evidence of the adaptive, scrappy, against-the-odds resourcefulness that separates startup founders from brilliant researchers. No signal that they've faced a serious obstacle and invented a creative workaround. No commercial hire. No pricing page. The company is "not currently hiring." The academic-to-commercial transition is one of the hardest pivots a founder can make, and nothing in the dossier suggests it's underway. Turning down Google is conviction, but conviction without commercial execution is just a research lab with a YC badge.

This is a case where I respect the founders and the science but can't get past the market structure. The idea is organic but the category is consensus. The technology is real but the moat is theoretical. The credibility is exceptional but it was built by giving away the core IP. I'd want to see named pharma customers, specific contract terms, and evidence that the agentic layer -- not just the published foundation model -- creates value that competitors can't replicate. Right now, CellType is a world-class research capability searching for a commercial form. That search might succeed, but it requires a different kind of founder skill than what's currently visible.
