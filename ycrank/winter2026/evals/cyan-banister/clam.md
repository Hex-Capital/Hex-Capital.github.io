# Clam -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Clam: every major cybersecurity platform company went on an acquisition spree for AI security startups in 2025. Palo Alto Networks paid over $500 million for Protect AI. Check Point scooped up Lakera. F5 bought CalypsoAI for $180 million. Noma Security raised a $100 million Series B. And now two Berkeley graduates are entering this space at pre-seed with a network-level firewall for AI agents. This is the definition of a market where consensus has already formed — not just among investors, but among Fortune 500 acquirers. When I backed SpaceX, or Uber, or Crusoe Energy, nobody else was writing checks because the ideas seemed insane. AI security is the opposite of that. Every large cybersecurity company on Earth is telling their board this is a priority. When I see that kind of consensus, I know the pricing is going to be wrong and the differentiation is going to be thin, because the weirdness — the thing that creates real asymmetric returns — has already been competed away.

If I were sitting across from Anshul and Vaibhav, I'd ask them what I always ask: tell me your story, not the business. And what I can see from the dossier is two technically accomplished Berkeley graduates who worked at impressive companies — Anshul was founding engineer at HappyRobot, which went on to raise $44 million, and Vaibhav built agent orchestration at Augment Code, a near-unicorn. That's strong professional pedigree. But it's not the kind of biographical thread I look for. There's no story of hardship that forged an unbreakable bond between this specific founder and this specific problem. They saw the security gap from inside AI agent companies, which is useful professional observation — but it's the kind of insight that a hundred other engineers at a hundred other AI companies also had simultaneously. When I invested in Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception that everyone else thought was a dead end. That biographical commitment is what tells me someone won't quit when things get brutal. Professional pattern recognition at a well-funded startup doesn't carry the same signal.

The product itself — a semantic firewall that intercepts agent traffic at the network layer — is logical, well-architected, and completely unsurprising. Any security-minded engineer watching the agentic AI space would arrive at exactly this idea. PII detection, prompt injection scanning, credential injection at the network level — these are all well-understood security patterns being applied to a new surface area. The dossier itself notes that the individual scanning capabilities are available as open-source libraries. That's a commoditization problem that concerns me deeply. When I think about defensibility and moats, which are among the first things I look for in early-stage companies, I need to see something that can't be replicated by a well-resourced team in a few months. A network-level wrapper around existing scanning tools, deployed on managed VMs, is architecturally straightforward. The data advantage from seeing agent traffic could compound over time, but you'd need massive adoption before that becomes a real moat, and every incumbent in the space has more existing customer data than you do.

The strongest bull case I can construct: the acquirers removed three independent competitors from the market simultaneously, and those acquirers are building broad AI governance platforms, not narrow agentic deployment security. If agentic AI adoption truly explodes in the next twelve to eighteen months, and if OpenClaw or similar frameworks become the standard, there's a window where a purpose-built solution with tight framework integration wins against bloated enterprise platforms. The founders genuinely understand the agent runtime environment from building inside it. And enterprise compliance teams will need something specific and auditable, not a collection of open-source libraries stitched together. That's a real argument. But it requires believing that the narrow niche stays narrow long enough to build a position before Palo Alto Networks or Check Point extends their newly acquired AI security platforms to cover it — and historically, that's a bet I've watched founders lose more often than win.

This company doesn't activate any of the signals I trust most. It doesn't create economic access for underserved populations — it's enterprise security tooling for other tech companies. It doesn't make an invisible system visible to regular people the way Flock Safety or Affirm did. It's not operating in a stigmatized or weird category that deters other investors — it's in one of the most actively pursued categories in enterprise software. The founders are credentialed insiders, not outsider misfits. I respect the technical execution and the timing awareness, but this is the kind of company that a dozen other investors would fund eagerly, and that's precisely why it's not my kind of bet. I'm looking for the deals that make people uncomfortable, and nothing about Clam makes anyone uncomfortable at all.
