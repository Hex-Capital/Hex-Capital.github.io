# Grade -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company that has done something I see constantly: two smart, capable founders with genuine domain expertise have surveyed the creator economy, identified a real operational pain point, and built a clean solution to it. And I stop right there. If Grade succeeds — dominates creator payment automation globally — the world gets slightly more efficient invoicing for influencer campaigns. Finance teams at DTC brands save hours per month. That's it. Nobody's food system changes. No trillion-dollar infrastructure gets replaced. No incumbent becomes structurally obsolete. The consequence of success is a nice vertical fintech company in a $3 billion market growing to maybe $8 billion. I don't invest my own money in nice vertical fintech companies.

The dossier makes the competitive problem explicit, and I appreciate the honesty: "the core payment orchestration layer is commoditized through Stripe, Wise, and similar infrastructure." Grade's differentiation is a workflow layer — performance tracking connected to payment calculation. That's a feature sitting on top of someone else's rails. When the dossier itself acknowledges "a new entrant with payments API access could replicate the basic product within months," I'm hearing that the technology creates no structural barrier. Compare this to what Square did: Square didn't optimize existing payment workflows — it created an entirely new class of merchant by putting a card reader in every pocket. The payment rails themselves were the innovation. Grade is routing payments through existing rails more conveniently for a specific use case. That's the difference between building infrastructure and building on top of it.

The founders are competent executors — I won't dispute that. James Heaney shipping Pray Screen to $40K MRR in two months demonstrates genuine speed. Lotanna has built and exited multiple companies in this exact domain. The 120% month-over-month growth in payout volume with $380K+ processed in the last 30 days is real early traction. But here's what I notice that a generic investor might miss: these founders are classic insiders. They've spent years in the creator economy. They know exactly what brands need. And that domain knowledge has led them to build precisely what the market asks for — which is exactly the trap I warn about. Industry experience creates "a set of biases that prevent you from making mistakes but also prevents you from inventing." Lotanna and James aren't inventing a new category. They're optimizing a workflow they've watched from the inside. Nobody is laughing at this idea. Nobody considers it impossible. The experts aren't dismissing it — the competitors (Lumanu at $20.6M raised, Stir at $20.7M, MONET at €17M) are already building adjacent solutions. When established players validate your approach rather than mock it, that tells me the innovation is incremental enough to be non-threatening.

Let me engage the bull case genuinely. If the shift from flat-fee sponsorships to performance-based creator compensation is as structural as the shift from hourly wages to commission-based sales, then the complexity explosion could be enormous. Every brand running creator campaigns across 190 countries needs automated performance tracking, variable compensation calculation, and multi-jurisdiction tax compliance — simultaneously. In that scenario, Grade becomes the "ADP for the creator economy," and the $250 billion creator economy TAM starts to matter. The timing is favorable: creator economy ad spend is growing 4x faster than total media, and the payment automation segment shows 20% CAGR. If Grade establishes the compliance and data moat across enough jurisdictions before the well-funded competitors pivot, switching costs could compound. The founders' prior relationship at Creator Check gives them working chemistry and shared context that most pre-seed teams lack. This is a plausible path to a several-hundred-million-dollar outcome.

But a several-hundred-million-dollar outcome is exactly what I mean when I say the consequences of success are insufficient. I structure my portfolio so that either the money expires or you build something that changes an industry. Grade, even in its most optimistic trajectory, doesn't change how the creator economy works — it just makes the back-office accounting smoother. The problem they're solving is real, but it's not a problem too important not to work on. These founders are too capable to spend their careers making invoicing 80% faster. They should be attacking something that terrifies them.
