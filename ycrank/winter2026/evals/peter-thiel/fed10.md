# Fed10 -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is: what is the secret? What important truth does this team believe that most intelligent people actively disagree with? I have read Fed10's entire dossier looking for that secret, and I cannot find one. "AI agents can replace expensive policy consultants" is not a secret -- it is the single most obvious application of large language models that anyone who has used ChatGPT for five minutes would identify. Reading dense text and producing summaries is literally what these models do. When I look at the competitive landscape and see USLege raising $2.7 million on an identical thesis months before Fed10 existed, FiscalNote and Quorum both shipping AI modules into their existing platforms, and Plural Policy getting acquired by SAI360 for the same capability -- I see a Girardian convergence. Multiple players imitating each other's vision, competing for the same customers with the same technology stack and the same commodity foundation models. This is not a market waiting for a monopolist. This is a market where the absence of any proprietary advantage guarantees that margins will be competed to zero.

The technology question is equally damning. The dossier states plainly that Fed10's core capability -- LLMs analyzing legislative text -- is "reproducible by any team with access to foundation models and legislative data feeds." Legislative text is public data. The models are available to everyone. The analysis task is well-defined and narrow enough that any competent team can build it. There is no 10x technological discontinuity here; there is a thin application layer over commodity infrastructure. When I backed Palantir, the secret was that PayPal's fraud algorithms could be adapted for intelligence analysis -- and the technology required years of engineering to build data fusion capabilities that genuinely did not exist elsewhere. Fed10 is not building technology that did not exist before. It is applying generally available models to a specific vertical, which is the definition of going from 1 to n rather than from 0 to 1.

The strongest bull case is worth taking seriously. These founders have genuine domain expertise -- Armand Iorgulescu drafted legislation signed into law as a teenager and was the youngest Governor appointee in Nevada. That hands-on experience in the legislative process is uncommon among AI startup founders and could theoretically translate into superior output quality, since they know what a real policy brief should look like and can evaluate AI output against that standard. The incumbents face an innovator's dilemma: FiscalNote and Quorum sell human analyst overlays as premium upsells, and building autonomous AI analysis that replaces those overlays would cannibalize their own revenue. If Fed10 moves with sufficient speed, it could capture the "AI-native" positioning in this niche before incumbents resolve their internal contradictions. There is also a workflow-embedding argument -- once a government affairs team builds its processes around Fed10's CRM, switching costs emerge. If I were constructing the optimistic scenario, it would require Fed10 to dominate a specific beachhead (say, mid-market trade associations in a single policy domain) so thoroughly that its product becomes 10x better for that segment through accumulated domain-specific training data, and then expand concentrically before incumbents can respond.

But that optimistic scenario has three fatal structural problems. First, USLege is pursuing the identical strategy with more capital and a time advantage -- this is not a monopoly race, it is a competitive footrace with no structural reason to expect one player to pull away. Second, the founders' domain experience, while genuine, is junior-level. Passing bills as a teenager in Nevada is impressive biography, but it is not the same as running a $50 million government affairs practice and understanding how Fortune 500 companies make procurement decisions about policy intelligence tools. Third, and most fundamentally, there is no mechanism through which early market entry compounds into an unassailable position. The data is public, the models are commodity, network effects are absent, and the incumbents have overwhelming distribution advantages -- Quorum alone has 2,000 customers including more than half the Fortune 100. A well-funded competitor could replicate every element of Fed10's product within a year.

The "lobbyist CRM" framing reveals something about how the founders think. A CRM is a tool -- it organizes existing workflows rather than creating new ones. When Stripe was founded, the Collison brothers did not build a "payments CRM." They built infrastructure that made a previously difficult thing trivially easy -- a genuine discontinuity in developer experience. Fed10's self-description oscillates between "autonomous consulting firm staffed by AI agents" (ambitious) and "lobbyist CRM for legislative intelligence" (incremental), and I find that oscillation telling. The company has not yet decided whether it is replacing the consultant or organizing the consultant's desk. Companies that cannot articulate a singular, definite vision of what they are building tend to iterate toward whatever the market will pay for -- which is lean methodology by another name.

I pass. The absence of a genuine secret, the competitive market structure, the commodity technology, and the lack of any visible path to monopoly make this a bet on execution in a crowded space rather than a bet on a contrarian truth about the world. The founders have energy and relevant experience, but energy and experience in a market with no structural advantage produce a business, not a monopoly. And businesses that compete earn returns that approach zero.
