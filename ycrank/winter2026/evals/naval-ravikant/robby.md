# Robby -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything about timing. Netic has raised $43M at a $450M valuation with 1,700% revenue growth. Housecall Pro shipped "CSR AI" and "Coach AI" in fall 2025. ServiceTitan went public at $8.45B and has a war chest. Arch has Coatue behind it. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal and people thought the idea was insane. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, it was dismissed as internet play money. This is the opposite situation -- "AI for home services revenue" is a consensus category where multiple well-capitalized players are already racing. You don't get paid for being right when everyone else is also right and got there first.

The specific knowledge question exposes a structural concern. These are three HBS grads who started with a customs brokerage AI platform, watched it crumble when tariff policy shifted, then "evaluated multiple industries before landing on home services." That's a market-search process, not a founder-problem inevitability. Joe's Bain work consulting PE firms on home services acquisitions gives him adjacency, not depth -- he advised on deals, he didn't run an HVAC company through a Texas summer. Vineet and Feroze are capable engineers from strong companies (Uber, Cloud Health Systems, Ironclad), but their technical backgrounds are in entirely different domains. The ride-alongs and EPA 608 certification pursuit show commendable effort and intellectual humility, but that's teachable knowledge being taught to them on a compressed timeline. Any smart three-person team could spend months shadowing technicians. The question I ask is: what does this team know after twelve months that a well-funded competitor couldn't learn in six? I don't see the answer.

The leverage architecture concerns me more than the traction encourages me. Robby delivers value at the unit of a technician visit -- contextual intelligence for a human physically present at a home. That's useful, but it's additive intelligence on top of a fundamentally linear process. Each visit still requires one technician, one truck, one home. Compare this to the leverage I look for: Stack Overflow where one answer serves a million developers, or Replit where one feature deployment reaches every coder on the platform. Robby's data loop has some compounding potential -- each documented visit feeds back into the recommendation engine -- but the delivery mechanism remains one-to-one. This is a sales enablement layer, not a new category of leverage. And it sits on top of ServiceTitan's infrastructure rather than being infrastructure itself. My portfolio leans heavily toward picks-and-shovels plays, and this is the application being used by the person holding the shovel.

The bull case I have to honestly consider: 9+ named paying customers at pre-seed is a real signal. "$40k in new business within an hour" on launch day is a concrete claim attached to a specific customer experience. "$135k additional revenue per technician per year" -- if defensible -- makes the ROI calculation trivial for any HVAC operator. Joe's PE consulting connections could open distribution through PE-owned roll-ups that control hundreds of locations. If Robby can embed deeply into technician workflows before Netic or Housecall Pro's AI features mature, the switching costs could be meaningful. The home services industry is enormous, genuinely underdigitized, and the labor shortage creates real pressure to maximize revenue per visit. If I believed the founders had a two-year knowledge advantage in technician workflow design that couldn't be replicated, this would be a different evaluation. But the evidence points to months of immersion, not years of compounding insight.

The team cohesion is solid -- Feroze and Joe previously co-founded Lifelong Health together, Vineet and Feroze were Pearce Fellows together, they all came through HBS. No integrity flags. Strong educational credentials. Competent engineers. But competence in a consensus market against well-funded competitors is a race I don't want to bet on. The technology -- combining CRM data with third-party sources to generate talking points and lead scores -- is technically reproducible by any team with LLM access and HVAC data. There's no deep-science moat, no protocol-level lock-in, no network effect that gets dramatically stronger with scale. This is a feature that ServiceTitan could build with a quarter's worth of engineering, or that Netic could extend from their adjacent position with a fraction of their $43M.

I'd pass. Smart founders, real traction for the stage, legitimate market -- but the combination of consensus timing, application-layer positioning, acquired rather than innate domain knowledge, and a well-funded competitor already at $450M valuation makes the asymmetry unfavorable. I want to invest where nine out of ten people think I'm wrong. Here, nine out of ten people agree this is a good idea, and several of them have tens of millions of dollars already deployed to prove it.
