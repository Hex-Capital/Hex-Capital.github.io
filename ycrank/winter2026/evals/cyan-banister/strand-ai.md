# Strand AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumped out at me immediately: the CEO Yue Dai used to work at Pathos, and now Tempus AI has announced a $200 million collaboration *with Pathos and AstraZeneca* to build a large multimodal oncology foundation model -- which is functionally the same capability Strand AI is building. So the founder's former employer is now partnering with a billion-dollar public company to do the thing he left to do as a startup. That's not just a competitive threat. It raises a very specific question I'd want answered in person: did you leave Pathos because you saw an opportunity they were missing, or did you leave and then they went and built it with Tempus's data and AstraZeneca's money? The answer matters enormously, and I can't find it anywhere in public sources.

And that leads to my deeper concern, which is that I can't hear these founders' stories at all. My entire process starts with "tell me how you got here -- not the business." Yue Dai went to McGill, worked as a software engineer at Pathos. Oded Falik got a BS from UT Dallas, worked at a stealth startup. That's a resume, not a story. I don't know what drove them to this problem. I don't know if Yue watched clinical trial data get thrown away at Pathos and felt something break inside him. I don't know if Oded has a family member with a rare disease. There's no public narrative, no Twitter presence to speak of, no talks, no blog posts explaining their conviction. For founders building something in a space this competitive, where Recursion has 65 petabytes of proprietary data and Tempus is doing nearly a billion in annual revenue, I need to understand what makes *these two people* the ones who will persist through the long, brutal slog of selling synthetic biological data to risk-averse pharma companies. Without that story, I'm flying blind on my most important criterion.

The honest bull case here is real, and I want to name it clearly. If Strand AI's imputation models genuinely work -- if they can predict proteomic profiles from standard pathology slides with validated accuracy -- that's transformative infrastructure. Every rare disease cohort is too small. Every clinical trial loses patients. The ability to fill those gaps computationally could unlock treatments that currently die in the data-insufficiency gap. That's the kind of invisible system made visible that I've been drawn to throughout my career -- Carta made cap tables transparent, Affirm made interest rates transparent, and Strand could make missing biological data reconstructable. The positioning as infrastructure rather than end-to-end drug discovery is smart; it's a pick-and-shovel play. And Yue's time inside Pathos presumably gave him a direct view of exactly where the data breaks. If I could sit across from these founders and hear a story that convinced me they'd persist through the inevitable regulatory skepticism and enterprise sales cycles, this could move from a pass to something interesting.

But I keep coming back to consensus. AI for drug discovery is not unpopular. It is not difficult to assess. It does not make people uncomfortable. It is arguably the single hottest category in venture capital right now. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, Crusoe Energy when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a fever dream -- those made smart people laugh or recoil. Nobody is laughing at "foundation models for biological data." Every major biotech investor is writing checks into this space. That's the exact market dynamic I've learned to avoid. When every VC in town wants in, the price is wrong and the differentiation has been arbitraged away. Strand AI is competing with companies that have hundreds of millions in funding, proprietary wet labs, existing pharma relationships, and their own data generation pipelines. Being a two-person YC company in this landscape without published benchmarks or validation studies isn't scrappy and weird -- it's just early and unproven in a space where incumbents are already moving fast.

The co-founder dynamic is another gap. No shared employer, no shared university, no visible history of working together through difficulty. I learned the hard way with HQ Trivia that even perfect product-market timing can't survive founder misalignment. I don't see red flags here -- I just don't see anything at all. Two engineers with no overlapping background building in one of the most demanding intersections of science and business, where the sales cycles are long, the regulatory environment is hostile to synthetic data, and the technical bar for credibility is extraordinarily high. I'd need to understand how they found each other and how they fight before I could get comfortable.
