# 10x Science -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the fundamental problem with 10x Science from where I sit: these are extraordinarily credible people building the most obvious possible thing. A postdoc from Carolyn Bertozzi's Nobel Prize-winning lab at Stanford, with 50+ publications and deep mass spectrometry expertise, decides to build AI-powered protein characterization software. Of course he does. That's what everyone would expect him to build. The idea doesn't provoke skepticism or confusion -- it provokes nodding. And nodding is the enemy of alpha. When I backed Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, people thought he was out of his mind. When I backed the Helium team, people asked me what decentralized IoT wireless even meant. Nobody is going to scratch their head at "AI for mass spectrometry analysis." This is a sane person with a sane idea, and that's my weakest configuration.

Let me apply the test I wish I'd applied more rigorously at Birchbox: does this business survive my structural moat analysis? The company's tags literally read "SaaS, B2B, Biotech, Enterprise Software, AI." That's five words and four of them trigger my skepticism reflex. The entire value proposition is that AI makes characterization faster and more accurate than legacy tools. Strip the AI away and there is no product -- just the existing software from Thermo Fisher and Protein Metrics that already works, if slowly. AI isn't the cherry on top here. AI is the sundae, the bowl, and the spoon. My test is simple: would this business be compelling without the AI component? The answer is clearly no, which means we're betting that this team's AI capability stays ahead of every incumbent and every other startup indefinitely. Thermo Fisher has a $180 billion market cap and already ships an "MS2 prediction algorithm" in BioPharma Finder. Waters has UNIFI embedded in validated biopharma workflows globally. When I say software moats are dissolving, this is the category I'm pointing at.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement because the domain complexity here is real. The instrument-agnostic positioning creates a structural conflict I find analytically interesting -- Thermo Fisher and Waters are incentivized to maintain hardware lock-in, not to build software that works across competitors' instruments. That's a real wedge. If 10x Science becomes the standard analysis layer that sits across all mass spectrometry platforms, it starts to look more like infrastructure than application -- closer to what Airtable did for non-technical databases, which was my one major exception to the anti-SaaS thesis. The regulatory embedding angle also matters: once a biopharma company validates its analytical methods using your software and references those methods in FDA filings, the switching costs become enormous. And the talent moat is genuine -- people who deeply understand both proteomics fragmentation patterns and transformer architectures are vanishingly rare. If you squint, there's a version of this that becomes the analytical infrastructure primitive for the entire AI-designed therapeutics wave, compounding its data flywheel with every drug candidate characterized.

But I don't think that version is the likely one. Protein Metrics, now backed by Insight Partners through Dotmatics, already has 200+ biopharma customers and 300+ academic institutions. They have the regulatory validation, the customer relationships, and the workflow integration. Adding AI features to an installed base is categorically easier than building an installed base from scratch with AI features. The competitive moat question isn't "can 10x Science build better AI?" -- it's "can 10x Science build better AI fast enough and distribute it broadly enough before Dotmatics bolts AI onto Byonic and Thermo Fisher upgrades BioPharma Finder?" That's a race against well-capitalized incumbents with distribution advantages, and history suggests the incumbents absorb the innovation rather than losing the market. The brand confusion with 10x Genomics -- a public company in an adjacent space -- compounds the distribution challenge in a way that's more than cosmetic.

What I keep returning to is the protocol position question. Venmo succeeded because peer-to-peer payments became a primitive other financial products built on. Helium worked because decentralized wireless became infrastructure. Is protein characterization software a primitive? Not really. It's a tool in a workflow, not a layer that enables an ecosystem. Other companies don't build on top of your mass spec analysis -- they consume its output and move on. That caps the compounding dynamics and limits the infinity story. The narrative can expand from peptide mapping to broader biologics QC, but it doesn't expand to "everything" the way protocol-layer bets do. The founders have the credentials and the timing tailwind from AI-designed therapeutics flooding the pipeline, but the structural positioning doesn't produce the kind of returns I need to see to write a check from my own capital.
