# Kyten Technologies -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The regulatory setup here is the kind of structural catalyst I can't ignore. NDAA Section 842 and the FCC Covered List are doing something unusual — the US government is literally legislating demand for domestic aerospace battery manufacturing into existence with a hard deadline. That's not a market trend you can debate. It's a forcing function with a ticking clock, and every drone maker, satellite builder, and defense prime with Chinese-sourced battery packs is staring at January 2028 knowing they need a new supplier. When I see a company positioned at the exact intersection of a regulatory mandate and a physical capability gap, my first instinct is to check whether the founders actually have the operational credibility to capture it. Cooper McBride and Lucas Maddox unambiguously do — six-plus years at SpaceX Starlink, 5,000-6,000 battery packs deployed to orbit, EE degrees with power specializations, and McBride built Shield AI's hardware test organization from zero to twenty people in under a year. These are not people cosplaying as hardware engineers. They lived inside the exact production environment they're now proposing to build independently.

Here's where my framework gets complicated. The founder calibration is strong on the "sane" axis — probably as strong as I've seen for a pre-seed hardware company. But the "insane" axis is weaker than I'd like. In the current defense-tech climate, "build domestic aerospace battery packs to satisfy NDAA compliance" is not a crazy idea. It's arguably the obvious idea. Every defense-tech investor in the country is looking for exactly this category right now. When the regulatory tailwind is this visible, the non-consensus premium evaporates. Compare this to Helium at seed — decentralized IoT wireless hotspots sounded genuinely deranged in 2014, and it took seven years before anyone agreed it made sense. Kyten's timing is excellent, but excellent timing and obvious market opportunity are often the same thing, which means the bet is less about founder vision and more about execution speed in a land grab. That's a fine business proposition but it's not my highest-conviction pattern.

What I do love here is the structural moat analysis. This is precisely the kind of company I mean when I say I'd rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company with a paint layer. Kyten's moat lives in physical manufacturing capability, aerospace qualification credentials, and regulatory compliance — none of which an LLM can replicate. AI makes this business strictly better: automated test systems, manufacturing optimization, quality control — all "cherry on top" applications where AI improves unit economics without enabling a software-only competitor to eat the market. The switching costs are real too — once a defense OEM has qualified a specific battery pack design for their platform under MIL-STD or DO-160, they're not switching vendors on a whim. This has the same structural logic as Craftwork: ugly, operationally intensive, impossible to replicate with code. The NDAA and FCC barriers add a regulatory layer on top that excludes the most obvious competitors (foreign manufacturers) entirely.

The dimension where Kyten falls short for me is the primitive-versus-application test. This is a contract manufacturing business, not a new protocol or layer that others build on. There are no network effects. Kyten doesn't become more valuable to Customer B because Customer A uses it. Compare this to Venmo, which created a peer-to-peer payment primitive that entire ecosystems built around, or Helium, which established decentralized wireless infrastructure that other applications plug into. Kyten makes custom battery packs. It's a good business — potentially a very good business — but it's not creating a new compounding layer in the economy. That caps the "infinity story" ceiling. The narrative can expand across verticals (drones to satellites to launch vehicles to marine), but each expansion requires incremental manufacturing capacity and sales effort. Growth is linear with capital deployed, not exponential with adoption.

The bull case that would change my mind: if Kyten's "automated software-defined test and manufacturing systems" are genuinely novel process IP — not just SpaceX methods transplanted into a new company, but a fundamentally new approach to battery pack manufacturing that compresses development cycles by an order of magnitude — then the speed advantage becomes a platform, not just a feature. If "design in one week, qualify in one week, produce in one week" is real and defensible, Kyten becomes the standard interface through which aerospace companies access custom battery capability, and that starts to look more like infrastructure than contract manufacturing. The SpaceX-derived automation could be exactly that kind of process innovation. But I have no evidence yet — no completed qualifications under Kyten's name, no paying customers, no demonstrated production runs. At pre-seed with $500K, the gap between "we know how to do this from SpaceX" and "we've built a factory that proves it" is enormous, and hardware companies die in that gap all the time. If they can show even one fully qualified pack delivered on a one-week timeline to a real defense customer in the next six months, I'd revisit aggressively.

For now, this sits in the zone where I respect the founders, believe in the market structure, and appreciate the AI-resistant moat — but the consensus nature of the opportunity and the absence of protocol-layer dynamics keep me from reaching for my checkbook. It's a hard, capital-intensive manufacturing land grab where execution matters more than vision, and the best outcome is a strong defense contractor, not an infrastructure primitive that reshapes how an industry works.
