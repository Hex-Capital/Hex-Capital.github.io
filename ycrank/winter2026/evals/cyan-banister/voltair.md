# Voltair -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

A drone that lands on a live high-voltage power line and drinks electricity from it. When I first read that, I felt something -- that little catch in my chest, the same kind of reaction I had when someone first described mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota. It sounds dangerous. It sounds impractical. It sounds like something a regulator would shut down before breakfast. And that's exactly why it interests me. The most promising companies are not popular and they are difficult to assess, and a self-charging drone perched on a transmission line is both of those things simultaneously. Nobody in the well-funded drone inspection space -- not Skydio with $715 million, not Percepto with $120 million -- has attempted this approach. Either it's impossible, or it's the kind of insight that only arrives when someone combines the right domain knowledge with the audacity to try something everyone else considers too risky. The patent-pending clamp mechanism, the proprietary micro-inverters, the insulating materials -- this is real physics solving a real problem in a way that makes incumbents structurally disadvantaged because they'd need a fundamental hardware redesign to compete. That's not a software moat. That's a physics moat.

But here's where I need to be honest about my own process. My first question to any founder is always "tell me your story," and what I'm listening for is the biographical thread that makes this founder inseparable from this problem. Ronan Nopp designing RC airplanes as a kid, building eVTOL controls in school, turning down SpaceX -- that's impressive. It shows conviction and talent. Hayden Gosch spending two years at Seattle City Light doing system protection engineering, then moving to Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories -- that's genuine domain knowledge from inside the utility world. These two have been friends since middle school, which gives me real comfort on the co-founder axis. But I'm not hearing a survival story. I'm not hearing the hardship that forged an unbreakable commitment to this specific problem. They're talented young engineers who built something remarkable in school. That's different from a founder who's been beaten up by this problem for years and simply cannot stop working on it. I'd want to sit across from Ronan and Hayden and hear what I'm missing -- maybe there's a story about growing up watching wildfires threaten their community, or something personal about why power infrastructure became an obsession. The dossier doesn't give me that, and it's the signal I weight most heavily.

What I do notice -- and this is something a more analytically-minded investor might miss -- is that Voltair fits squarely into my pattern of companies that make invisible systems visible. Rural power lines are the definition of invisible infrastructure. They're out there decaying in the weather, and nobody sees them until they start a fire that destroys a town. PG&E went bankrupt because of invisible degradation on invisible lines. Voltair is proposing to make every mile of rural grid visible every 60 days instead of every 5 to 11 years. That's the same structural shift as Flock Safety bringing public safety data to neighborhoods, or Carta replacing opaque spreadsheets with transparent cap tables. When you compress the inspection cycle from years to weeks, you're not just preventing wildfires -- you're making a massive invisible system legible for the first time.

The team composition is smarter than it first appears. For a group of recent graduates, they've assembled surprisingly relevant domain coverage: a CTO who actually worked inside a utility doing the exact kind of system protection work their customers care about, a Chief Growth Officer who's done government affairs consulting at Virgin Galactic and Amazon Kuiper (FAA navigation is everything here), and a COO with SBIR grant experience and Boeing engineering background. This is a regulated, capital-intensive, hard space -- FAA BVLOS approvals, utility safety certifications, hardware deployment at scale -- and the team isn't naive about what they're walking into. My comfort with regulated sectors goes back to my IronPort days, and I've learned that regulatory complexity deters competitors just as effectively as it deters the founders. The ones who can navigate it build durable advantages. The question is whether this specific team, at this stage, can actually close a utility procurement deal that typically takes 12 to 24 months.

Let me steelman the case for this being a great investment. If the self-charging mechanism works reliably at scale -- and they've already validated the core technology and inspected 2,000 poles -- then Voltair has something no competitor can replicate without years of R&D. The market timing is extraordinary: the 2025 Palisades fires and PG&E's bankruptcy have made wildfire liability an existential issue for utilities, creating the kind of urgency that compresses sales cycles. FAA BVLOS frameworks are progressively opening up. And "fewer than 1,000 pads for national coverage" suggests the infrastructure deployment may be more capital-efficient than it appears. If I'm wrong about the biographical grit dimension -- if these founders have a deeper personal connection to this problem than what's visible in the public record -- then this could be a SpaceX-shaped bet: a capital-intensive infrastructure play at a major technological inflection point, backed by founders with genuine technical audacity. I backed SpaceX as my first angel check when private space seemed insane, and the core parallel here is a hardware company solving a physics problem that everyone else considers too hard or too weird to attempt.

But I'm not at that level of conviction today. The weirdness factor is real and the regulated-space navigation looks promising, but without the founder survival narrative that drives my highest-conviction bets, and with the broader drone inspection category becoming increasingly consensus even if this specific mechanism is non-obvious, I land in a position of genuine interest tempered by my process. I'd want to meet Ronan and Hayden in person, hear how they argue, understand what drives them beyond intellectual fascination. The middle-school friendship is a good foundation, but four co-founders from three different universities raises questions about team dynamics that only a conversation can answer. This is a company I'd watch closely and want to talk to -- not one I'd write a check for today based on what's in front of me.
