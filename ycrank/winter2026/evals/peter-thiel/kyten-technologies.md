# Kyten Technologies -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking thing about Kyten is what it reveals about the current state of American industrial policy: the United States Congress has effectively legislated a market into existence. NDAA Section 842 and the FCC Covered List don't just create a tailwind -- they mandate domestic sourcing for aerospace batteries beginning 2028. This is the closest thing to a government-guaranteed customer base short of a direct contract. And yet this is precisely what troubles me. When a market opportunity is written into federal statute and visible to every defense-tech investor in the country, it is not a secret. It is a consensus. The question I always ask -- "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" -- has no satisfying answer here. "America needs domestic battery manufacturing" is a policy position shared by both parties in Congress, the Department of Defense, and every VC fund with a defense-tech thesis. When the insight is unanimous, the returns converge toward zero.

The competitive structure confirms this diagnosis. EaglePicher has powered 600 satellites. CRG Defense already markets itself as NDAA-compliant. Custom Power has been building aerospace battery packs since 1965. Amprius manufactures proprietary silicon anode cells with $53 million in backlog. Electric Power Systems has Boeing and Safran behind it. Kyten enters a market with established incumbents and well-funded startups -- the very condition I describe as a Girardian nightmare. Multiple players pursuing the same thesis in the same market, differentiated primarily by execution speed and sales relationships. This is not a zero-to-one situation. It is a one-to-n situation where the "n" is a faster version of what already exists.

Kyten's claimed differentiation -- compressing each development phase from months to one week -- deserves scrutiny. If the 25-50x speed improvement is real and verifiable across full customer-accepted aerospace qualification (MIL-STD-810, DO-160), that would approach the 10x threshold I consider necessary for proprietary technology advantage. But there is a significant gap between internal screening and flight-qualified, customer-accepted qualification. SpaceX could move fast because it was qualifying hardware for its own vehicles -- internal qualification is a different beast than satisfying a defense prime's supply chain team at Lockheed or Northrop. The dossier notes no completed qualifications under Kyten's own name, no LOIs, no revenue. The speed claim remains an assertion, not a demonstrated capability in the commercial context they're entering.

The founders merit serious attention. McBride and Maddox spent six to seven years at SpaceX building and testing the exact product they now want to commercialize -- over 5,000 battery packs deployed to orbit. McBride then built Shield AI's hardware test team from zero to twenty people, demonstrating he can operate outside the SpaceX ecosystem. This is genuine founder-market fit. They have touched the atoms, understood the failure modes, and built the automated systems. I am reminded, loosely, of Palantir's origin -- taking capabilities developed inside one organization and commercializing them externally. But the analogy breaks down at the critical point: Palantir's software created deepening integration moats with every deployment, making it progressively harder to displace. Battery packs are physical products that ship and are consumed. There are no network effects. Each contract must be won independently. The switching costs from aerospace qualification are real but finite -- a competitor with equivalent credentials can win the next contract.

The strongest bull case requires me to consider whether the regulatory-plus-speed combination creates a temporary monopoly window. If Kyten can be the first domestic supplier with one-week turnaround while incumbents still operate on six-month cycles, and if the NDAA deadline creates urgent demand that overwhelms incumbent capacity, Kyten could capture a disproportionate share of the reshoring wave. The SpaceX network provides warm introductions to exactly the satellite, drone, and launch vehicle companies that need compliant packs immediately. In this scenario, early contracts create qualification lock-in, and volume production generates learning-curve advantages that widen over time. This is a plausible path to becoming a significant defense supplier -- General Matter addresses a similar gap in nuclear fuel sovereignty with DOE contracts, and I joined that board. But General Matter is doing something the United States literally cannot do today -- enriching HALEU fuel. Kyten is doing something that existing companies already do, just claiming to do it faster. The difference between "the US has no capability" and "the US has slow capability" is the difference between a genuine secret and an incremental improvement.

Fundamentally, Kyten is a well-executed contract manufacturing business in a favorable regulatory environment, founded by people with excellent domain credentials. That is a description of a good company, not a great one. It does not answer the question of what truth they see that others reject. It does not create a new category. It does not have a structural path to monopoly beyond execution speed, which can be replicated by any well-funded competitor that hires from the same SpaceX alumni network. I would watch for evidence of proprietary process technology that creates genuine barriers -- if the automated manufacturing systems prove to be an order of magnitude more capital-efficient than competitors, or if qualification speed proves out with paying customers, the picture changes. But on present evidence, this is a competitive market with a consensus thesis, and that combination is precisely what I avoid.
