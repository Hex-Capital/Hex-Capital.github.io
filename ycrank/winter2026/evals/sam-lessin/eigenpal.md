# EigenPal -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

EigenPal is my pass example made manifest. When I say "I'd rather fund a painting company with a tech layer than a tech company with a paint layer," this is the tech company I'm contrasting against. The entire value proposition is "we use vision-language models to process documents without templates." Strip out the AI, and there is no business. That's not a cherry on top -- that's the whole sundae. And the dossier's own risk analysis confirms the structural problem in plain language: "Any team with access to commercial vision-language models (GPT-4V, Claude, Gemini) can build basic document extraction." When your own competitive analysis concedes that anyone with an API key can replicate your core capability, you're describing a feature, not a company.

The founders are competent -- that's what makes this frustrating. Blaszyk's time at Elastic and Yelp building search infrastructure gives him genuine technical credibility for document indexing and retrieval pipelines. Novak has an MIT CS degree and has founded three B2B AI companies, raising $4M for Assetario. These are sane people. But "sane person, sane idea" is the worst possible combination for generating outsized returns. "AI for document processing" is literally the demo every foundation model company runs on stage. It's consensus wrapped in consensus. Every VC who has seen a GPT-4V demo has thought about intelligent document processing. That's the problem -- the opportunity is so visible that it's already being priced in across dozens of competitors, including incumbents with massive distribution advantages. ABBYY, Rossum, and Hyperscience are all racing to integrate LLM capabilities into their existing platforms with their existing customer bases. Rossum already has $44.9M in revenue and 450+ enterprise customers. EigenPal is bringing a better mousetrap to a market where the mouse has already been caught.

The moat question here is devastating when examined through my structural lens. The claimed defensibility consists of SOC II Type 2 certification (any funded startup can obtain this), on-premises deployment (an engineering investment, not a structural barrier), and an open-source DOCX editor with 396 GitHub stars (a modest developer tool, not a protocol). None of these are AI-resistant. None of them compound. The compliance certifications create marginal switching costs for existing customers, but they don't prevent a well-funded competitor -- or an incumbent adding an LLM layer -- from serving the next customer. Software IS the business here, and software moats are dissolving faster than founders realize. When ABBYY ships their LLM-powered template-free processing -- and their February 2024 press release showing 60% new ARR growth suggests they have the resources to do it -- EigenPal's differentiation evaporates.

Let me steelman the bull case, because I want to be honest about what would need to be true for this to work. Two large European bank customers at pre-seed is a genuine signal -- banks don't engage with random startups on loan automation. If those relationships convert to contracted revenue and expand, EigenPal could build an enterprise wedge in financial services document processing. The architectural cannibalization argument has some teeth: ABBYY and Kofax built their businesses on per-template licensing, and shifting to template-free LLM processing genuinely threatens their revenue model. If incumbents are slow enough, and EigenPal can lock in enough regulated enterprise accounts with on-prem deployments and compliance certifications, there's a path to building a real business. The workflow orchestration and evaluation framework -- testing against historical documents before deployment -- could become genuinely sticky if deeply embedded in enterprise operations. But "if incumbents are slow enough" is a bet on competitor incompetence, not structural advantage. And the co-founder attention question nags: Novak is still listed as CEO of Assetario alongside his EigenPal role. That's not "rizz and tizz" -- that's hedging, and I need founders who are all-in on an idea that most people think is crazy, not founders splitting time between a consensus play and a previous startup.

This company occupies the exact intersection of my two strongest negative theses: SaaS moats are dissolving, and AI is a bad startup investment when AI IS the product. EigenPal is a software tool whose sole moat is AI capability, competing against incumbents with distribution, in a market where the underlying technology is commoditizing in real time. It creates no new primitive, establishes no protocol, and has no physical-world operations that software cannot replace. The IDP market is real and large, but EigenPal is an application on someone else's infrastructure -- riding GPT-4V and Claude Vision rather than building a foundational layer. I need businesses that get stronger as software gets cheaper. This one gets weaker.
