# Fenrock AI (YC W26) -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I noticed about Fenrock AI is that it sits squarely in the center of what every venture capitalist in San Francisco is excited about right now: AI agents applied to a large, growing enterprise market. Nearly 80% of organizations plan to invest in AI for financial crime compliance by 2026. Feedzai just raised at a $2B valuation. Sardine is growing ARR 130% year over year. Flagright, a YC alum from S22, already has $14.1M and is positioning as "AI-native AML." This is not an unpopular idea. It is not difficult to assess. It does not make people uncomfortable. And that, for me, is the problem. The companies I've built my portfolio around -- SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, Crusoe when mining Bitcoin on gas flares sounded like a joke, Contraline when male contraception made VCs literally squirm -- they all shared the quality of being deeply unwanted by the investment consensus. Fenrock is the opposite: it's a well-understood opportunity in a validated market with clear tailwinds. That's exactly the environment where I lose my edge and where price gets arbitraged away before the company proves anything.

When I ask "tell me your story," I want to hear the biographical thread that makes this founder the inevitable person to solve this specific problem. Charu Sharma has genuine resilience -- a scholarship student who built two VC-backed companies, got to Forbes 30 Under 30 in healthcare for digitizing patient records across Latin America, and then had the courage to close a startup and keep building. That's real. I respect someone who's been through the valley of shutting something down and coming back. But her prior companies were an HR mentoring platform and a Latin American healthtech operation. Her enterprise sales experience was at LinkedIn. Her AI recognition came from work in a different domain entirely. I can't find the thread that connects her life to AML compliance, KYC reviews, or sanctions screening. No time spent in a compliance department. No banking background. No personal encounter with financial crime that I can see. The dossier describes her as having "advisory experience in fintech" through a single advisor role at PocketCFO, which is a thin biographical link to a domain where buyers need to trust that you understand their regulatory world at a cellular level. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception -- his life and the company were the same story. I don't feel that fusion here.

The strongest case for Fenrock would be this: a proven enterprise sales operator with two prior companies under her belt enters a massive market ($9.8B by 2032) at the exact technological inflection point where agentic AI makes full workflow automation feasible for the first time. Incumbents like NICE Actimize and Oracle have business models built on the manual labor they're supposed to eliminate -- they literally can't cannibalize their own services revenue. A fast-moving startup with no legacy architecture could thread the needle before the Feedzais and Sardines retool their platforms. And the unnamed second team member might be a compliance domain expert who fills every gap I'm flagging. If Charu's execution speed and enterprise sales instincts from LinkedIn and NextPlay translate to bank compliance departments, and if the regulatory moat solidifies once the first few institutions validate the system, this could become a very defensible business. I take that scenario seriously -- I've seen serial founders with strong operational DNA enter new domains and win through sheer execution velocity.

But I keep coming back to what I don't feel. This company doesn't create economic access for people who currently lack it. Compliance analysts at banks are not an underserved population. Better AML tools help institutions, not the communities harmed by financial crime -- and even that connection is several steps removed. There's no invisible system being made visible to people who need it. Carta made cap tables transparent for employees. Affirm made interest rates honest for borrowers. Flock Safety put public safety data in the hands of communities. Fenrock makes a back-office function faster for regulated enterprises. That's a legitimate business, but it doesn't activate the part of my thesis that cares about positive-sum economic outcomes for real people. And the co-founder situation genuinely bothers me -- the second team member isn't publicly identified anywhere. After what happened with HQ Trivia, where the co-founder dynamic destroyed a perfectly timed product, I need to understand who's in the room and how they work together. I can't evaluate what I can't see.

This is a competent founder attacking a real market, and I wouldn't be surprised if Fenrock builds a solid business. But it doesn't match the way I invest. I'm looking for misfits building things that make other people uncomfortable, not talented operators entering validated markets. The absence of a biographical connection to the problem, combined with the consensus nature of the opportunity, means this isn't where my conviction forms.
