# Seeing Systems -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Seeing Systems is that Alexander and Matthew Le Maitre are brothers. After watching HQ Trivia collapse entirely because of irreconcilable founder conflict -- the right product, the right timing, destroyed by two people who couldn't resolve disagreements -- I started paying very close attention to co-founder dynamics. I've said publicly that I have a preference for family-run businesses, and brothers who grew up together on Guernsey have stress-tested their relationship for decades before writing a single line of code. The skill split is clean -- Alexander handles hardware, Matthew handles software -- which means they're not stepping on each other's work. This is one of the strongest co-founder signals I've seen in a pre-seed company. It doesn't guarantee success, but it removes one of the primary failure modes I've learned to fear.

What I don't have, and what I need before I get truly excited, is the personal story. My whole evaluation process starts with "tell me how you got here -- not the business." Alexander being self-taught in embedded electronics resonates with me deeply -- I taught myself to code at public libraries, so I recognize that path of proving yourself without credentials. And his work at Wildcat I.S., designing EOD training hardware that NATO and Special Forces actually use, tells me he's not a tourist in defense. He's been building things that soldiers trust with their lives. That's real. But what I'm missing is the biographical thread that makes this problem feel inevitable for these founders. Why autonomous strike drones? Why now? Was there a moment where Alexander saw something in the field that broke him open? Professional domain expertise is valuable, but it's different from the kind of biographical obsession I saw in the Contraline founder, who spent years in academic research on male contraception while everyone else ignored the space. I'd need to sit with the Le Maitres and listen before I could score this dimension with real conviction.

Here's where I get uncomfortable: defense tech has become consensus. When I backed Anduril, defense technology was deeply unpopular in Silicon Valley -- most investors wouldn't touch it, and founders in the space were treated like pariahs. That unpopularity was the signal. Now Helsing has raised over a billion euros, Shield AI is valued at five billion, and European defense startups just had their best funding year ever. Germany is writing nine-hundred-million-euro contracts for kamikaze drones. The category is no longer difficult to assess or unpopular -- it's one of the hottest markets in venture. Two brothers from a Channel Island building strike drones is genuinely unusual as an origin story, and the specific niche of low-cost modular expendable platforms is somewhat differentiated from where the big money is flowing. But I can't pretend this is the kind of pre-consensus weirdness I look for. The window where defense tech was a contrarian bet has closed.

The bull case is real though, and I want to be honest about it. These founders are already shipping prototypes to UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces. At pre-seed. With five hundred thousand dollars. That is extraordinary traction for a hardware company at this stage -- most defense startups spend years just getting a meeting with procurement officers, and the Le Maitres already have iterative feedback loops running with actual military units. Alexander's Wildcat I.S. relationships almost certainly opened those doors. If the agentic AI control system truly enables autonomous operation in GPS-denied and EW-contested environments, and if the modular hardware approach lets them iterate faster than fixed-design competitors like Stark (whose Virtus loitering munition failed all four military trial strikes), then the combination of speed, modularity, and existing customer relationships could let them carve out a real position before the well-funded competitors consolidate. The structural advantage they'd have is that Lockheed, BAE, and the defense primes face a genuine innovator's dilemma -- their business models depend on expensive platforms, and building intentionally cheap expendable drones cannibalizes their core revenue. That creates a window for a nimble startup.

Where this falls short for me is the economic access dimension that runs through my best investments. Uber created income for drivers. Postmates created income for delivery workers. Affirm gave people transparent credit. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that lacked it. I look for companies that make invisible systems visible and create opportunity for people who currently lack it. Autonomous strike drones serve an important national security purpose, and I respect that -- my background at IronPort was in security. But this doesn't create the kind of positive-sum economic access that gets me out of bed in the morning. It's a capability sale to existing power structures, not an expansion of access to underserved populations. That doesn't make it a bad company, but it means it doesn't activate the part of my thesis that generates my deepest conviction.

The capital asymmetry is worth naming directly. Hardware companies burn cash. Manufacturing at military specifications, supply chain management, quality assurance, facility buildout -- this will require orders of magnitude more capital than their current five hundred thousand dollars. Their competitors have raised billions collectively. The Le Maitres will need to raise significant follow-on funding quickly, and in a now-crowded defense tech market, that round will be competitive rather than contrarian. I invest at the earliest stages precisely because the price is right and the opportunity is pre-consensus. Here, the next round will likely be priced to reflect the defense tech boom, which cuts against my price sensitivity instincts.
