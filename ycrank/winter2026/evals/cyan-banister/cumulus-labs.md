# Cumulus Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Cumulus Labs is that it exists in one of the most crowded, well-capitalized, and consensus-validated spaces in all of tech right now. Together AI has raised $533 million. Fireworks has $327 million. Lambda has $2.3 billion. RunPod is already at $120 million ARR. Modal has $111 million in funding. This is the opposite of "not popular" and "difficult to assess" -- GPU cloud infrastructure is arguably the single most popular investment category in Silicon Valley today. When I think about what activates my instincts as an investor, it's the company that makes other investors uncomfortable, the one that sounds a little crazy when you describe it at a dinner party. Serverless GPU cloud does not make anyone uncomfortable. It makes every growth-stage VC in San Francisco reach for their checkbook. That's a problem for how I invest.

I want to hear the founder story here, and honestly, the dossier gives me very little to work with. Suryaa Rajinikanth was a lead engineer at TensorDock, which built a distributed GPU marketplace -- the same category Cumulus operates in. He left to start what appears to be a more ambitious version of the same thing. That's interesting domain experience, and I respect someone who's lived inside a problem and believes they can solve it better. Veer Shah graduated from UW-Madison in December 2025 and brings aerospace and defense experience from Space Force SBIR contracts and NASA programs. These are technically impressive backgrounds for recent graduates. But when I sit across from a founder and ask "tell me your story -- not the business," I'm listening for the specific hardship that made this problem inevitable for them. What I hear here is two talented engineers who chose a large market because they have the skills to compete in it. That's rational. It's just not what pulls me in. There's no biographical thread connecting their lives to this particular problem in a way that suggests they'll persist through the kind of crisis that will inevitably come when they're competing against companies with a thousand times their capital.

The strongest bull case is genuinely worth engaging with. If Suryaa learned specific lessons at TensorDock about why GPU aggregation fails at scale and has built Ion to solve those exact problems, that insider knowledge could be a real edge. Inference is overtaking training as the dominant GPU workload, open-weight models are proliferating, and there's a real need for inference-optimized infrastructure that's cheaper than API providers but easier than self-hosting. Cloudflare acquiring Replicate signals that consolidation is happening and acquirers are buying. If Ion actually delivers the performance it claims -- 16.7 seconds cold start versus Modal's 70 seconds -- that's a meaningful technical advantage. And sometimes the right two-person team with deep domain knowledge and YC backing can carve out a wedge in a massive market before the larger players notice. The Cumulus OS on-premises play could create enterprise switching costs that turn into a real moat. I don't dismiss any of this. But I keep coming back to the fact that the competitors aren't asleep -- Modal, RunPod, and Fireworks are all actively building inference optimization, and open-source engines like vLLM and SGLang are improving every week. The window for a technical edge to matter is narrow when you're outgunned on capital by orders of magnitude.

I also don't see the economic access angle that draws me to my best investments. Uber created income for drivers. Postmates created income for delivery workers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people locked out of the system. Cumulus makes GPU compute cheaper for AI teams -- teams that are, by definition, already well-resourced enough to be running inference workloads. There's a distant argument that cheaper compute democratizes AI, but that's several degrees removed from the direct, tangible economic impact I look for. Nothing here makes an invisible system visible or creates opportunity for people who currently lack it.

On co-founder dynamics, I have almost nothing to evaluate, and that absence itself is a data point. No shared university, no shared employer, no public information about how they met or how long they've worked together. When I think about what I learned from HQ Trivia -- that even perfect timing and a perfect product can't survive founder conflict -- I want to understand how these two handle disagreement, especially when the pressure of competing against billion-dollar companies starts to mount. I'm not saying the dynamic is bad; I'm saying I can't see it, and that makes me cautious.

This is a pass for me, and it's not because I doubt the founders' technical ability or the size of the market. It's because everything about this company -- the category, the competitive dynamics, the investor enthusiasm around the space -- screams consensus. I'm most useful and most right when I'm backing the thing nobody else wants to fund. Cumulus Labs will find plenty of investors who are excited about GPU infrastructure. I'm just not the right one.
