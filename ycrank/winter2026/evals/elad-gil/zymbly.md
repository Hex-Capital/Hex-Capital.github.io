# Zymbly -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Aviation MRO is the kind of market most software investors dismiss without a second look -- safety-critical, regulation-heavy, long sales cycles, and a $7 billion TAM growing at a pedestrian 4.6% CAGR. That dismissal is exactly what makes me pay attention. The "too boring, too regulated" archetype has been my highest-conviction bet type: PagerDuty in operations alerting, Gusto in payroll, Checkr in background checks. And the founder composition here is the strongest signal in the dossier. Robbie Bourke wasn't an aviation consultant who studied maintenance workflows from a slide deck -- he was Head of Aircraft Maintenance at Virgin Atlantic and a lead engineer at Airbus. When a co-founder has 25 years of direct operational experience in the exact workflow the product automates, that's not founder-market fit. That's founder-market identity. The Oliver Wyman network connecting all three founders gives them a warm path into airline procurement offices that a cold-start team would spend years building.

The structural moment question -- what changed in the last 12-24 months -- has a real answer but not a spectacular one. Two forces converged: LLMs and voice AI crossed the accuracy threshold needed for real-time querying of technical manuals in safety-critical contexts, and the North American aviation technician shortage (43,000 workers by 2027, per Oliver Wyman) created genuine urgency to augment productivity. When technicians spend half their day on administrative tasks -- searching manuals, looking up parts, writing compliance documentation -- and you can't hire enough of them, the math on AI-assisted workflows becomes straightforward. The problem is that this "why now" isn't non-obvious. Any investor who reads about the technician shortage and knows LLMs exist could draw this line. Compare this to Coinbase in 2012, where most investors couldn't even articulate why crypto needed infrastructure, or PagerDuty in 2010, where "operations alerting" sounded like a feature, not a company. Zymbly's market is genuinely boring and genuinely important, but the AI-for-workforce-shortage thesis is increasingly consensus.

Where my enthusiasm cools is on the technology moat question. The core product -- RAG over maintenance manuals, voice-to-text, document generation -- uses widely available building blocks. CAMP Systems, with 45 years of installed base and 1,500+ service centers, already launched an AI Operations Manager in October 2025. EmpowerMX shipped EMX Vision in 2023 before being acquired by IFS. When incumbents with massive distribution are shipping AI features on their existing platforms, a startup overlay needs to be 10x better, not incrementally better. The dossier's claimed metrics (70% troubleshooting time savings, 45% document QC improvement) are impressive if real, but without disclosed methodology, I can't weight them. The deeper concern is that Zymbly's overlay-on-ERP positioning -- which is smart for reducing adoption friction -- also means the switching costs are moderate. If CAMP or Ramco ships a comparable AI layer natively, the value proposition of a separate tool diminishes. This is the "smart toaster" risk: not that the product isn't useful, but that the technology is a feature rather than a structural competitive advantage that compounds.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. If Zymbly's design partnership with a major global airline converts into a production deployment and generates referenceable results, the regulatory trust barrier becomes a moat rather than a headwind -- they'd be one of very few AI tools validated in a Part 145 environment. Bourke's network could then compress sales cycles that would otherwise take 12-18 months. The product-to-distribution trajectory is plausible if narrow: voice-first interaction could become the technician's primary interface, expanding from documentation to predictive maintenance, parts procurement, and training -- essentially becoming the "technician operating system" that distributes multiple workflows through one integration point. That's the Gusto pattern: payroll was the wedge, but the real business was becoming the small business HR platform. For Zymbly, admin automation could be the wedge into the broader technician workflow. But this multi-product vision isn't articulated in anything public, and the vertical is narrow enough that even successful expansion stays within aviation MRO.

The single-miracle framing is reasonably clean here: the one thing that must work is gaining regulatory and cultural trust for AI-assisted maintenance documentation in safety-critical aviation environments. The team's design choice of built-in "natural friction" with mandatory human sign-off suggests they've thought clearly about this obstacle. And critically, unlike Harvey's miracle (model fidelity), which was being delivered by foundation model labs, Zymbly's miracle requires their own execution -- building trust in aviation is a relationship-by-relationship, deployment-by-deployment process. That's achievable, but it's slow and doesn't scale the way a technology-delivered miracle does. One question I can't resolve from public data: whether Bourke is fully committed. His LinkedIn still lists Board Member and Advisor roles, and he was appointed Head of Aerospace at Clermont Group as recently as August 2023. A CCO who's splitting time is a different proposition than a full-time co-founder in enterprise sales.

This is a competent team attacking a real problem with correct timing, but I don't see the asymmetric return profile I look for. The market isn't inflecting fast enough -- 4.6% CAGR means I'm betting on a sub-segment growing faster than the base, which is plausible but unproven. The technology isn't defensible enough against incumbents adding AI features. And the distribution path, while aided by Bourke's network, faces the structural constraint of enterprise sales cycles in safety-critical environments with a three-person team. I'd want to see the design partnership convert to a paying contract, evidence that the voice-first interface creates meaningfully better outcomes than CAMP's AI Operations Manager, and clarity on Bourke's full-time commitment before writing a check.
