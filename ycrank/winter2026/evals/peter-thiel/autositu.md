# AutoSitu -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells you everything you need to know. Five companies -- PermitFlow, CivCheck, Blitz AI, CodeComply.AI, Cembla -- are all pursuing the same thesis: AI can automate municipal plan review. PermitFlow has raised $90.5 million. CivCheck was already acquired by Clariti. California's governor publicly announced an AI tool for building permits. When the governor of the largest state in the union is endorsing your thesis in a press release, you do not have a secret. You have consensus dressed in a hard hat. The entire municipal AI permitting category is a convergence of mimetic desire -- companies imitating each other's positioning, differentiating on marginal features ("we do multi-agent coordination," "we focus on pre-screening," "we serve the reviewer side"), competing for the same municipal budgets with the same pitch deck. This is the structural signature of a market that will destroy everyone's margins.

The question I always start with -- what important truth does this company see that no one else sees? -- yields nothing here. The implicit thesis is that municipal development review is slow and AI can accelerate it. This is not a secret. It is an observation that every urban planner, every developer waiting nine months for a permit, and every AI company scanning for government applications has already made. AutoSitu's specific claim is that the bottleneck lives on the municipal reviewer side rather than the applicant side, and that multi-agent coordination across departments is the right architecture. This is a reasonable product decision, but it is not a contrarian truth that most experts would reject. Multiple competitors are already building for the same buyer with the same logic.

The strongest case for AutoSitu rests on the Palantir analogy, and it is worth examining seriously. Palantir succeeded in government because its technology became operationally embedded -- switching costs compounded with every year of deployment, every analyst trained, every workflow integrated. AutoSitu's Code & Precedent Graph, which accumulates jurisdiction-specific regulatory knowledge with each city onboarded, has the same structural potential. If those eight named city clients -- San Jose, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Dallas, Long Beach, Honolulu -- represent genuine operational deployments rather than pilots or evaluations, the switching costs could be formidable. Government procurement is slow to enter but equally slow to exit, and a municipality that has trained its planning staff on AutoSitu's workflows will not casually rip it out. The data moat is real: each city's zoning code is a unique corpus, and the precedent patterns generated through actual review cycles cannot be replicated without doing the same deployments. If AutoSitu has genuinely embedded in these cities before competitors, that would matter.

But the analogy breaks precisely where it matters most. Palantir's secret was non-obvious -- the insight that PayPal's fraud-detection algorithms could be repurposed for counterterrorism intelligence was something most people in both Silicon Valley and the intelligence community would have argued against in 2003. The technology was proprietary, built on years of anti-fraud engineering that had no equivalent in the market. AutoSitu's multi-agent review engine, by contrast, is built on generally available large language model capabilities. The claim of "50-70% reduction in city comments" is matched by CivCheck's "97%+ accuracy and 80%+ reduction in permit approval times" and Blitz AI's "5x review time reduction." When your competitors can quote similar performance metrics, your technology is not 10x better -- it is table-stakes capability applied to the same problem. The founders bring complementary domain expertise -- Lin's Harvard GSD planning background paired with Zhai's Georgia Tech AI and robotics work -- but I see no evidence of the kind of intellectual depth or definite vision that characterizes founders who build enduring monopolies. No public statements, no visible frameworks for how they think about the world, no record of refusing an easier path.

The market itself presents a structural ceiling that concerns me independently of competition. The global permit management software market is $1.25 billion growing to $3.72 billion by 2033. This is not the kind of market where power-law returns are possible. Even complete dominance of this category would produce a company worth single-digit billions at best -- a good outcome, but not one that justifies the risk profile of a pre-seed investment in a crowded field. The jurisdictional fragmentation problem compounds the concern: each new city requires ingesting unique regulatory codes, which means scaling is labor-intensive rather than software-marginal. This is a consulting-like dynamic masquerading as a SaaS model, and it constrains the velocity of growth that would be needed to outrun five competitors.

The honest assessment is that AutoSitu is a competent team applying current AI capabilities to an obvious problem in a market where multiple funded players are converging on the same thesis. The government switching-cost moat is structurally real, and if the eight named city deployments are genuine, there is defensibility in that installed base. But defensibility is not monopoly. There is no secret here -- no truth about the world that most intelligent observers would reject. There is no technological discontinuity -- no capability that makes the old approach structurally obsolete in a way competitors cannot replicate. And there is no evidence of the kind of definite, civilizational vision that separates founders who build enduring companies from founders who build features that get acquired. This is a pass.
