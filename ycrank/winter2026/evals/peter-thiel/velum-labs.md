# Velum Labs -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Velum is not the product or the founders but the competitive landscape, because the competitive landscape tells you whether a secret exists. Lakera raised $30 million and was acquired by Check Point. Securiti raised $156 million and was absorbed by Veeam. Noma Security raised $132 million and reports 1,300% year-over-year ARR growth. Lasso raised $6 million. And now Velum enters with $500,000 and two founders, claiming to build the same category of thing -- an AI security layer for enterprises deploying LLMs. When I count four well-funded companies and two incumbent acquirers all converging on the same thesis -- "AI workflows create data leakage risk and enterprises need protection" -- I am not looking at a market with a secret. I am looking at a market where everyone already agrees on the problem, the solution category, and the buyer. That is the definition of competition, and my framework is unambiguous about what happens next: margins compress, differentiation erodes, and the category gets absorbed into incumbent platform plays. The acquisitions are not clearing the field for a new entrant; they are proving that standalone AI security tools become features inside larger platforms.

What is the secret here? Velum's claimed insight is that access controls should operate at the content level -- understanding meaning in text, not just gating access to files or tables. But this is not a truth that most smart people disagree with. It is a truth that most enterprise security professionals already accept. Microsoft Purview, Symantec DLP, and a decade of content-aware data loss prevention tools have been working on exactly this problem. The AI-specific variant -- intercepting prompts and responses to redact sensitive data -- is precisely what Lakera, Securiti, and Noma were funded to build. The ontology-based approach to policy definition is an implementation choice, potentially a good one, but it is not a contrarian thesis about the world. It is a product architecture decision within a consensus market. When I ask "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" and the answer is "enterprises need content-level security for AI workflows," I hear an echo of what every CISO and every AI security vendor already believes. There is no Girardian escape here -- only deeper mimetic entanglement.

The product positioning itself reveals a deeper problem. The website describes Velum as "the ontology engine for enterprise AI." The YC page calls it "an open-source firewall for content-level access control." The blog references "the dynamic data firewall for your unstructured data." Three different framings suggest the founders have not yet committed to a definite vision of what they are building. This is precisely the pattern I associate with indefinite optimism -- the belief that the right positioning will emerge through iteration rather than being designed from conviction. Contrast this with Palantir, where Alex Karp and I spent years building a specific product for a specific customer (the intelligence community) before expanding. Palantir's identity was never ambiguous. When a company cannot describe itself consistently across its own website and its YC listing, it signals that the founders are searching for product-market fit rather than executing against a predetermined plan. "Lean is code for unplanned" applies here.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously. First, that the acquisitions of Lakera and Securiti have genuinely cleared the standalone market rather than signaling that standalone AI firewalls are becoming features. Second, that the ontology-based approach represents a technical discontinuity sufficient to create switching costs that compound over time -- that once enterprises encode their data policies as ontological entities and relationships, the cost of migrating to a competitor becomes prohibitive. Third, that the open-source strategy will generate the developer adoption that creates a distribution moat against well-funded proprietary alternatives. If all three are true, Velum could become the default content-level control plane for enterprise AI, a position that would be genuinely valuable. But I see no evidence for any of these propositions. The open-source strategy has produced no visible GitHub traction. The ontology approach, while technically interesting, has not been demonstrated to be 10x better than rule-based or pattern-matching alternatives. And a two-person team claiming fifty-plus enterprise integrations and SOC 2 Type II certification strains credibility -- either these claims are aspirational rather than actual, or they reflect pre-built components from prior work that have not been pressure-tested in production.

The CTO's background is the most credible signal in the dossier. Alen Rubilar-Muñoz has a pinned GitHub repository called "ontology," principal engineering experience building a managed ML platform, deep learning research across multiple institutions, and hackathon wins that demonstrate raw technical capability. This is a builder, and I respect that. But technical capability without a contrarian secret produces competent companies in competitive markets -- exactly the kind of company that earns single-digit returns. The CEO's quantum computing background at Stanford is intellectually impressive but orthogonal to enterprise data security. Neither founder appears to have worked inside enterprise security, sold to CISOs, or operated within the regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP) that govern their target buyers. Founder-market fit is a gap, not a strength.

This is a pass. The market structure is fundamentally wrong for my framework -- too many well-funded competitors pursuing the same thesis, incumbents consolidating the category through acquisition, and no visible secret that would allow Velum to escape the competitive dynamics that will destroy margins across the sector. The company is going from one to n, not from zero to one.
