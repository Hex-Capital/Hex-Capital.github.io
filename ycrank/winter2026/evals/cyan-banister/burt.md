# Burt -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me isn't the product or the founders -- it's the identity crisis. The YC page says one thing (general-purpose model fine-tuning platform), and the actual website says something completely different (AI automation for logistics back-office). That split tells me more than any pitch deck could. When I'm evaluating a pre-seed company, I need to feel that the founders are gripped by a specific problem -- that they can't not build this thing. A company that's simultaneously pitching itself as a horizontal platform competing with Together AI and Fireworks ($534M and $327M raised, respectively) and as a vertical logistics automation tool hasn't yet found the problem it's obsessed with. That ambiguity isn't a strategy pivot -- it reads to me like a search for product-market fit dressed up in two different outfits.

If I could sit down with Bobby Zhong, I'd want to hear the story. Not the business -- the story. How does a UC Irvine dropout who built Educado for schools, then joined Pirros, then joined Replo building coding agents, end up burning with conviction about fine-tuning specialized models? Or about logistics invoices? What I see in the public record is a talented young builder who's been cycling through the YC ecosystem, gaining real engineering chops at each stop. That's admirable. But I don't see the biographical thread that ties Bobby to this specific problem in the way that makes me believe he'll persist through the valley when the money runs out and the competitors are spending more in a month than Burt has raised total. The founders I back tend to be solving problems that emerged from their own scars -- their own frustration with a broken system they personally endured. Bobby may have that story, but nothing in the dossier reveals it, and the product's dual identity suggests the problem space itself hasn't fully crystallized for the team yet.

Here's what I'll say for the bull case, because I want to be honest about what could make this work: the structural insight buried in the dossier is genuinely sharp. Cloud providers are incentivized to maximize compute consumption -- every token, every GPU hour is revenue. A company that helps customers use *less* compute by deploying smaller, faster, specialized models is structurally misaligned with the incumbents' business model. That's the kind of insight that reminds me of Affirm's position against credit card companies who profit from opacity. If Burt leaned hard into logistics and built deep expertise in the specific document formats that logistics companies drown in -- bills of lading, rate confirmations, customs paperwork -- they could build genuine switching costs through accumulated domain knowledge. The Predibase acquisition at $100M+ validates that fine-tuning capabilities get absorbed into enterprise stacks, which means there's a real exit path even if the standalone platform doesn't scale. And Bobby's willingness to drop out and keep building does carry some of that outsider energy I respect. For this to become my kind of bet, I'd need Bobby to look me in the eye and tell me about a formative experience with logistics or with the frustration of watching teams burn money on bloated general-purpose models -- some lived experience that makes this more than a smart market observation.

But I keep coming back to what's missing. LLM fine-tuning is about as consensus as AI investing gets right now. Every VC in the Valley understands that specialized models outperform generalist ones -- this isn't a secret or a weird insight that makes people uncomfortable. It's table stakes. The companies I gravitate toward look ridiculous to other investors at the point of investment. SpaceX was private space when that was insane. Crusoe was turning waste gas into Bitcoin when people thought it was a joke. Burt is building AI tooling in 2026 -- that's the definition of a hot market, and the most promising companies are not popular. I also can't evaluate what I can't see, and Kurt Sharma is essentially a ghost in the public record -- no LinkedIn profile found, no GitHub, no professional background. For a company whose entire value proposition rests on technical depth in model training and deployment, the CTO's invisibility creates a gap in my ability to assess whether this team can actually deliver what they're describing against competitors with hundreds of engineers.

This is a pass for me. Not because Bobby isn't capable -- he clearly is -- but because nothing here activates the pattern recognition I've learned to trust. There's no survival story that explains why this problem, no weirdness that makes other investors squirm, no narrative about creating economic access for underserved people, and no regulatory complexity creating a moat that deters competitors. It's two smart engineers building in the hottest category in tech, and that's exactly the kind of consensus-adjacent bet I've trained myself to avoid. I wish them well -- the logistics vertical is the more interesting direction by far -- but this isn't a check I'd write from my own money today.
