# Mendral -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Mendral is something that would be invisible to most investors: this idea wasn't invented, it was inevitable. Sam Alba was Docker's first employee. Andrea Luzzardi wrote the initial Docker code at DotCloud, created Swarm, then co-founded Dagger -- a CI/CD pipeline engine -- with Solomon Hykes. These two have spent over a decade building the infrastructure that CI/CD runs on. They've watched pipelines break tens of thousands of times. They know which failures are common, which are subtle, and which make engineers lose entire afternoons. When they say "most tooling is still pre-AI, creating alerts without solving problems," they're not quoting a market report. They're describing something they've personally observed since before most AI startups existed. This is the organic origin I look for -- an idea that grew from years inside the machinery, not from a brainstorming session about where to apply LLMs.

The schlep here is real but worth examining carefully. The obvious schlep is trust: engineering teams are, rightly, terrified of anything that autonomously modifies their code. Getting a team to let an AI agent open pull requests against their production codebase requires earning a kind of trust that can't be shortcut with demos. You have to prove accuracy across thousands of failure patterns specific to that team's stack. The less obvious schlep is the sheer combinatorial mess of CI environments -- different build tools, test frameworks, infrastructure configurations, dependency graphs, monorepos versus microservices. Every customer's pipeline is a snowflake. This is the kind of tedious per-customer complexity that makes smart engineers think "I could build a prototype of this in a weekend" and then never ship it, because the prototype handles 30% of cases and production requires 95%. That said, the underlying technology -- LLMs reading logs and generating fixes -- is not proprietary. The moat here is integration depth and accumulated failure-pattern data, not a technical breakthrough. Compare this to Stripe, where the schlep was regulatory and banking relationships that took years to build. Mendral's schlep is shallower. GitHub Copilot expanding into agentic workflows is a real threat, and building on someone else's platform with someone else's models is a structural vulnerability I can't ignore.

What impresses me is the traction for a pre-seed company. Five paying customers, including PostHog -- which is itself a serious YC company with real engineering standards. PostHog wouldn't adopt a tool that breaks their CI pipeline. Fifteen teams in production total, with named customers across the site. SOC 2 Type II certification at this stage is almost absurdly disciplined; most pre-seed companies haven't even thought about compliance. These are founders who've sold to enterprises before and know what the procurement conversation looks like. That's not something you learn from a blog post.

The technical founder signal is as strong as I've seen at pre-seed. Sam has 88 public repos on GitHub; Andrea has 66 plus a 1.4k-star project. Andrea worked at Google on planetary-scale distributed storage. These aren't founders who will hire engineers to build the product -- they are the engineers. When I apply my "animal test," I'd describe both of them as animals at infrastructure engineering. They've built systems that millions of developers depend on daily.

The question I can't resolve from the outside is the Dagger situation. Sam's LinkedIn still lists Dagger as his current role. Dagger raised $30M+, has ongoing development, and appears to be an active company. Are these founders fully committed to Mendral, or is this a side project that might get folded back into Dagger? I've seen attention splits kill companies. If they're fully in on Mendral and Dagger is behind them, this concern evaporates. If they're straddling both, that's a problem. The charitable interpretation is that Mendral emerged from insights gained at Dagger and represents their next chapter -- which fits the pattern of founders who learn from one company and apply those lessons to a better one. The uncharitable interpretation is divided attention. I'd want to ask them directly.

The strongest bull case is that these are repeat YC founders with decade-deep domain expertise, proven ability to build and ship infrastructure products, real paying customers at pre-seed, and a product that sits at the intersection of "obvious pain" and "newly possible." Every engineering team wastes hours on broken CI. LLMs just crossed the capability threshold to actually fix these problems autonomously. The founders who literally built Docker and Dagger are the right people to build this. If they execute, the learning loop could create real per-customer switching costs over time, and the trust they've already established in the DevOps community gives them a warm distribution channel that cold-start competitors lack. The commoditization risk is real, but execution speed and domain depth could outrun it -- and incumbents are historically slow to ship autonomous code modification because it contradicts their reliability-first DNA.

I'd invest. The organic origin is genuine, the founders are clearly technical animals who built the infrastructure this product sits on, and the early traction with named paying customers is a real signal. The Dagger attention question and the platform dependency on GitHub are real concerns, but they're the kind of risks where the founders' domain depth gives them the best possible chance of navigating them. This isn't my highest-conviction bet -- the schlep isn't as deep as Stripe's, and the LLM commoditization risk is structural -- but the founder-problem fit is exceptional.
