# Kita -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the tension I keep circling on with Kita: the founders are exceptionally credentialed, the traction is real, and the market need is genuine — but when I run my structural tests, the architecture of this business is precisely the category I'm most cautious about. Two Stanford CS graduates, one with the Firestone Medal for the best CS thesis in the department, building vision-language-model-powered document processing for emerging market lenders. That's a sane team with a sane idea. And sane-plus-sane, in my framework, is actually a warning sign. The idea makes too much sense. Nobody hears "we use AI to process financial documents for Philippine lenders" and thinks the founders are crazy. They nod along. Compare that to Anatoly Yakovenko proposing yet another Layer 1 blockchain during crypto winter — people thought he was out of his mind. That asymmetry between founder credibility and idea skepticism is where the truly asymmetric returns live, and I don't see it here.

The AI kill test is where this gets uncomfortable for Kita. Strip away the vision-language models and there is no company — no product, no differentiation, nothing. This isn't a great business where AI happens to make it better. AI IS the business. That's the exact category I've been publicly saying is a bad startup investment since 2024. Apple, Google, and the next wave of foundation model providers are all converging on multimodal document understanding. What's genuinely hard today — extracting structured data from a noisy Philippine e-wallet receipt — may be a commodity API call in eighteen months. The dossier itself acknowledges this: "Vision-language models are rapidly improving and becoming more accessible." When the company's own risk section reads like my investment thesis against the category, that's telling.

Now, the strongest bull case — and I want to be fair to it because there's real substance here. Kita's hyperlocalization could function as something closer to physical-world operational complexity than typical software. The fraud patterns in Indonesian lending, the specific document formats from GCash and Maya in the Philippines, the regulatory regimes across Southeast Asia and Latin America — this is market-by-market knowledge that generic AI can't replicate by throwing more compute at the problem. It's more like Craftwork's painting crews than it first appears: the operational texture of each market creates barriers that software alone can't leap. The lending-outcome feedback loop — linking document signals to actual repayment data — is the right architectural idea. If Kita processes enough documents across enough lenders, that feedback loop becomes a genuine data moat that improves with volume. And the traction supports the thesis: a six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage, customers across multiple markets, 30% month-over-month growth. That's not vaporware. Carmel Limcaoco being from Manila gives her the kind of insider advantage that's hard to fake — local network, cultural fluency, understanding of which signals actually matter for lending in these markets. If everything breaks right, Kita becomes the Ocrolus of emerging markets, deeply embedded in underwriting infrastructure across Southeast Asia and Latin America, processing billions in lending decisions.

But I keep coming back to the structural position. Kita is an application on existing infrastructure, not a new primitive. It doesn't create a layer that other companies build on — it's a vendor to lending institutions. That caps the upside story. Venmo created a payment primitive. Helium created a wireless protocol. Even Ocrolus, Kita's closest comp, has struggled to break out of its document-processing box at $500M+ valuation. The narrative can stretch from "Philippine document processing" to "emerging market lending infrastructure," and that's a meaningful arc — but it's not an infinity story. There's a ceiling where you're a document processing vendor to banks, and document processing vendors to banks don't produce the kind of compounding, winner-take-most dynamics I look for at seed.

The founders are legitimately impressive — Rhea Malhotra's Firestone Medal and published computer vision research give her deep technical credibility for this specific problem, and Carmel's combination of Manila roots, Apple product experience, and prior founding history at Stanford shows both operational instinct and market access. Their pre-Stanford relationship suggests genuine co-founder depth, not an accelerator speed date. But the question I can't get past is whether this technical firepower is pointed at a structurally defensible target. My bet is that the VLM commoditization wave moves faster than Kita's feedback loop can accumulate enough proprietary data to matter. I'd rather see these founders building something where AI is the cherry on top of an already-defensible business, not the entire sundae.
