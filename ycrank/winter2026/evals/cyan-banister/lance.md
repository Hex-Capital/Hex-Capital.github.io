# Lance -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Lance: this is a popular space. Canary Technologies has raised over $180 million. Duve just closed $60 million. Akia, HiJiffy -- there's a whole ecosystem of well-funded companies all circling the same insight that hotels need AI. When I see that level of consensus, my instinct is to walk in the other direction. The most promising companies I've backed looked bad to most investors at the time of investment. SpaceX was absurd. Uber was illegal. Crusoe Energy was mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota. Hotel AI in 2026? Everyone agrees this is happening. When everyone agrees, the price is usually wrong and the weirdness has been arbitraged away. That said, Lance's Computer Use Agent approach -- where AI navigates existing hotel software interfaces rather than requiring API integrations -- does carry a spark of genuine technical novelty. It's the one thing that made me pause.

The founder question is where I get stuck. My first instinct is always: tell me your story, not the business. Why hotels? Caleb Chan has a strong resume -- product at Google and Salesforce, founding engineer at a company with a nine-figure exit. That exit tells me he can build and ship. Gatik Trivedi founded and exited MedTec Innovate young, did speech research at Stanford. These are accomplished people. But I can't find the biographical thread that connects these three Berkeley guys to the hospitality industry specifically. Where's the personal stake? My strongest investments have always been in founders where their life story and the company's mission are inseparable -- where the problem found them before they found the market. Here it looks like technically capable founders who identified a large addressable market and applied their AI skills to it. That's smart. It's rational. But it's not the signal I invest on. When I back someone, I'm asking myself: would I drop everything to work for this person on this specific problem? And for that to be true, I need to feel that their commitment is forged from something deeper than market analysis.

The economic access dimension also gives me pause. I've always been drawn to companies that create opportunity for people who currently lack it -- Uber created income for drivers, Postmates for delivery workers, Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out of traditional finance. Lance does the opposite. It explicitly replaces hotel front desk workers and call handlers with AI agents. "Reduced front desk call volume by over 30%" is an efficiency metric for hotel operators, not an empowerment story for workers. Now, I'm not naïve about the staffing shortage being real -- 65% of hotels report gaps -- but the value flows upward to hotel ownership groups, not outward to underserved populations. That's not inherently wrong, but it doesn't light me up in the way my best investments do.

To be fair, the bull case here is real and I want to be honest about it. Fifty-plus hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt properties at the pre-seed stage is exceptional traction by any measure. That's not vaporware. That's a working product that hotel groups are actually using in production. The Quore partnership shows channel strategy thinking. The voice-first approach is a genuine differentiation -- most competitors are text chatbots, but hotel guests overwhelmingly communicate by phone. And the Computer Use Agent approach, while fragile to UI changes, creates per-property workflow knowledge that compounds over time and would need to be rebuilt by any competitor. If Lance can move fast enough to embed themselves across hotel portfolios before Canary Technologies bundles AI Voice into their platform, there's a path to a meaningful outcome. Caleb's operational experience from his previous exit suggests he understands the urgency of that race. For an investor who evaluates primarily on market timing and product execution, this could be a strong bet.

But I'm not that investor. I'm looking for the founders and ideas that make other people uncomfortable. I'm looking for the pocket of dreamers and weirdos building something the world hasn't validated yet. Lance is a well-executed company solving a well-understood problem in a well-funded market. The team is competent, the traction is real, and I have no doubt they'll raise their next round. This just isn't a Long Journey bet -- it doesn't have the biographical depth in the founders, the anti-consensus positioning, or the economic access story that would make me want to write a check from my own money.
