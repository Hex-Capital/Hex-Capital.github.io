# Rhizome AI -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that caught my attention first is the path Chetan Mishra took to get here. He was the sole founding product engineer at EvolutionaryScale — a biology AI company that raised $142M from Amazon, Nvidia, and Nat Friedman. From inside that world, he noticed something that everybody else in life sciences AI was unconsciously filtering out: everyone wanted to build tools for discovering drugs, nobody wanted to build tools for the miserable slog of getting them approved. That's a specific flavor of schlep blindness. Drug discovery is the glamorous part of biotech. Regulatory affairs — reading terabytes of FDA documents, parsing dense guidance language, navigating six different regulatory agencies — is the part that makes smart engineers look away. It's the banking and regulatory pain that kept people from building Stripe, except the documents are denser and the accuracy requirements are even more punishing.

The organic discovery isn't the purest form I've seen. Chetan wasn't a regulatory affairs professional who got frustrated after his thousandth manual FDA search. But the chain of experience is real and cumulative: ML engineering at IBM, then document processing for regulated industries at Instabase (employee #16, serving banks), then building the developer platform at a biology AI company. Each step deposited a layer of relevant expertise until the problem became visible to him. That's closer to how Drew Houston stumbled into Dropbox — not from suffering the exact pain himself at first, but from accumulated proximity to it until the gap became obvious. The EvolutionaryScale experience was the specific moment he saw the gap between drug discovery and drug approval. That's organic enough for me.

What impresses me most is the execution density. One person. Six figures in revenue. Twenty-plus customers. A 2.5TB corpus spanning 30 regulatory datasets across 6 markets. 2,800 questions answered with a claimed zero hallucination rate. That last number matters enormously in regulated industries — a regulatory affairs professional who gets a hallucinated citation in an FDA submission faces consequences that no amount of product polish can compensate for. Building a RAG system that maintains that accuracy bar across thousands of queries on dense regulatory language is genuinely hard engineering. This isn't an LLM wrapper. The quality requirements are the moat. And the fact that he built all of it alone tells me he's a technical builder of the kind I instinctively trust — someone who ships product, not someone who manages engineers.

The solo founder question is the obvious concern and I have to be honest about it. I told Drew Houston he needed a co-founder before I'd accept Dropbox, and that's one of my strongest priors. Enterprise sales to pharma regulatory teams requires sustained effort across sales, support, data pipeline maintenance, and product development simultaneously. One person can't do all of that indefinitely. But Houston was also a solo founder when he applied, and the solution was to make co-founder recruitment a condition rather than a rejection. The more relevant question is whether Chetan can attract a co-founder now — and his track record (Instabase early employee, EvolutionaryScale founding engineer, South Park Commons member, now YC) suggests he moves in the right circles. The revenue also helps. Nobody wants to co-found a company with a PowerPoint. A company with 20 paying customers in pharma is a different conversation.

The competitive dynamics actually work in Rhizome's favor in a way that might not be obvious. Clarivate has the relationships — 100% of top-20 pharma uses Cortellis. But Clarivate's business model is built around change-tracking dashboards and site licenses. Bolting an AI Q&A system onto that is the kind of architectural retrofit that large companies are structurally bad at, because it threatens to cannibalize the existing product. They've added a "Regulatory Assistant" but if it were genuinely good, Rhizome wouldn't have 20 paying customers. The fact that regulatory affairs professionals are paying $400/month out of their own budget for a startup product when their company already has a Clarivate license is a signal of real pull. That's the "would be disappointed if it disappeared" test, expressed in credit card transactions.

If I'm wrong about this company, it'll be because general-purpose LLMs get good enough at regulatory language that the domain-specific RAG advantage erodes, or because Clarivate takes the threat seriously enough to build a genuinely competitive AI product rather than a feature checkbox. But the accuracy requirements in regulated industries create a quality bar that generic systems struggle to clear, and incumbents struggle to prioritize when their existing revenue comes from a different product architecture. The schlep protects you. That's the whole point — the reason this problem was sitting in plain sight is the same reason it'll be hard for others to replicate well.
