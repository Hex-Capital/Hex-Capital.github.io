# General Legal -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of General Legal is the gap between the quality of the team and the banality of the thesis. Ryan Walker was CTO of Casetext through its $650 million acquisition by Thomson Reuters. J.P. Mohler and Javed Qadrud-Din are both Harvard Law graduates who practiced at Cooley and Fenwick -- firms that represent the very startup clients they now target. All three worked together building legal AI at Casetext. This is a genuinely exceptional founding team. And they have chosen to deploy that exceptionalism into a market where the Artificial Lawyer has already created a taxonomic category for their model -- "NewMod" -- and can list them alongside batchmates and funded competitors pursuing structurally identical approaches. When a trade publication can name your category, you do not possess a secret. You possess a consensus.

What is the secret here? I cannot find one. "Law firms are expensive and slow, and AI can make them cheaper and faster" is not a truth that few people agree with -- it is a truth that Harvey ($1.1 billion raised, $190 million in ARR), Lawhive ($100 million raised, $35 million in revenue), Spellbook ($80 million raised, 4,000 law firm customers), and at least two of their own YC batchmates all agree with. The positioning as a licensed law firm rather than a SaaS tool is a tactical differentiation, not a contrarian insight -- Lawhive operates the same model in the UK and is expanding to the United States with $60 million in fresh capital. When your differentiation is a regulatory form factor that others have independently adopted, you are describing an organizational choice, not revealing a hidden truth about the world.

The mimetic dynamics of legal AI in 2026 are a textbook illustration of the competition trap. Multiple well-funded players pursue the same customers with the same thesis using the same underlying technology. The LLM capabilities that enable contract review at speed are broadly accessible -- GPT-4 and its successors are not proprietary to General Legal or anyone else. The dossier itself acknowledges that "competing firms or new entrants could adopt similar AI workflows without needing to build proprietary technology." The founders' deep knowledge from Casetext gives them workflow optimization advantages, but workflow optimization is a 2-3x improvement, not a 10x discontinuity. A $500 flat fee for contract review is a pricing innovation, and pricing innovations invite imitation. Any competent attorney with LLM access could offer similar services tomorrow. This is 1 to n -- taking what worked at Casetext and redeploying it in a different legal wrapper. It is not zero to one.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. If General Legal can monopolize commercial contracting for the YC ecosystem -- a concentrated, high-value beachhead -- they could expand concentrically into increasingly complex legal work, becoming the default legal infrastructure for growth-stage technology companies. The regulatory barrier of being a licensed law firm creates real friction for pure SaaS competitors like Harvey and Spellbook, who cannot practice law without restructuring their entire business. The Casetext exit proves this team can build and scale legal AI products, and their combined legal practice and ML engineering expertise is rare. If every contract reviewed generates proprietary training data that makes their AI workflows compound in accuracy and speed, they could build a data flywheel that new entrants cannot replicate. That is the scenario in which this becomes a durable business. But it remains a durable business, not a monopoly. The $500 flat-fee model has no network effects -- each contract engagement is independent, switching costs approach zero, and the expansion into complex legal work (M&A, IP, litigation) requires entirely different expertise and attorney hiring. Nothing in this model compounds the way Facebook's network or Palantir's government integrations compounded.

The founders left comfortable post-acquisition positions at Thomson Reuters to start this company, which signals genuine conviction. But conviction about what? "We can build a better law firm" is an ambition, not a vision of the future. I see no evidence that these founders have articulated what the world looks like if they succeed in the way that Zuckerberg could describe social networking's end state or Musk could describe multiplanetary civilization. They are solving a real problem -- startup legal costs are genuinely too high -- but solving a real problem in a competitive market with available technology and no structural path to monopoly is precisely the kind of company I avoid. The power law demands that every investment have the potential to return the entire fund. A flat-fee law firm, even a very good one, does not have that potential.
