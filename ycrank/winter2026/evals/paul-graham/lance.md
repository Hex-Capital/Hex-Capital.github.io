# Lance -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Lance is that 50+ hotel deployments across Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt properties is extraordinary for a pre-seed company. Most YC companies at this stage have five customers and a prayer. Landing multi-property hotel groups operating under major franchise brands means navigating procurement processes, brand compliance requirements, and property management hierarchies that are designed to repel startups. You don't get to 50+ properties by sending cold emails. Someone was in the lobby, on the phone with the regional operations director, probably installing the system themselves at 2 AM when the front desk shift changed. That signal matters. It tells me these founders know how to sell into enterprise accounts that shouldn't be buying from three-person teams.

But here's what concerns me. When I look at how these founders found this problem, I see capable AI engineers who chose hospitality as their target market, not hoteliers who discovered they needed to build AI. Caleb built voice and AI agent technology at Google and Salesforce. Gatik built agent infrastructure at GI Partners and LLM evals at Knowtex. Gavin worked on AI agents at Domo. The combined skill set is "we know how to build AI agents" -- and then they went looking for a vertical to aim them at. That's the pattern I worry about. It's not quite the startup idea machine failure mode -- they clearly have relevant technical DNA -- but it's also not Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive. The strongest companies grow from founders who lived inside a problem so long they couldn't help but build the solution. I don't see that story here, and the dossier doesn't give me one.

Where Lance genuinely earns points is on the schlep. Hotel operations technology is one of those messes that everyone in the industry knows about and nobody wants to clean up. The PMS landscape is fragmented across Oracle OPERA, Cloudbeds, Mews, and a dozen others. Each property has idiosyncratic workflows. Brand standards vary. And the genius move -- or the insane move, depending on how it plays out -- is the Computer Use Agent approach: instead of building API integrations with each PMS vendor (the "clean" engineering path that every other hospitality AI company is taking), Lance's agents navigate the existing software UIs directly. That is choosing the hardest possible path through the problem. It's fragile, maintenance-intensive, and ugly. But it means they can work with any hotel's existing tech stack without waiting for integration partnerships. Most AI companies in this space would unconsciously avoid this approach because it feels like a hack rather than proper engineering. That's schlep blindness in its purest form -- the approach everyone filters out because it's painful is precisely the one that works fastest in a market running on legacy software.

The competitive landscape gives me pause. Canary Technologies has $180 million and a $600 million valuation. They've already launched AI Voice as a module and they have existing hotel relationships. That's the kind of well-funded platform competitor that can bundle AI voice at near-zero marginal cost alongside check-in, tipping, and upsells. Duve just raised $60 million. When the category already has a player with a hundred times your funding, you need to be doing something fundamentally different, not just better. Lance's argument would be that Canary treats voice as one feature among many, while Lance is building a full autonomous operations layer. That distinction matters in the short run -- depth beats breadth when you're small -- but it narrows as Canary iterates on its voice product. The question is whether Lance can build enough per-property workflow knowledge and operational depth across those 50+ hotels to make switching genuinely painful before Canary catches up.

The bull case that would change my mind: if those 50+ deployments are generating real revenue -- not pilots, not free trials, but hotels paying monthly and expanding their usage across agent types -- then this team has achieved something rare. The customer testimonials hint at genuine value ("reduced front desk call volume by over 30%," "recovering revenue from restaurant bookings to reservation changes"), and hotel operators don't keep products deployed that don't work. If the revenue data showed consistent month-over-month growth and hotel group expansion deals in the pipeline, the story shifts from "smart AI team picked a vertical" to "this team has cracked enterprise hospitality distribution at an unprecedented pace." Add a compelling origin story -- maybe Caleb spent months embedded in hotel operations before writing a line of code -- and I'd be looking at a different evaluation entirely.

The founding team is technically capable. Gatik's combination of Stanford speech research, YC S22 experience at Knowtex, and a prior exit from MedTec Innovate gives the CTO real credentials for this problem. Caleb was a founding engineer at a company that reached a nine-figure exit, which means he's seen what it takes to scale. The Berkeley connection between all three founders is thin as a co-founder origin story -- it's not the kind of deep pre-existing relationship I look for -- but it's not the "met at a co-founder matching event" red flag either. No public GitHub repos from any founder is a minor note, not a dealbreaker, especially when they've clearly built a working product that's deployed at scale.

This is a competent team attacking a real problem with a technically ambitious approach, and they've generated traction that would be impressive at Series A, let alone pre-seed. What's missing is the organic founder-problem connection that separates companies built from conviction from companies built from opportunity. The schlep is real. The traction is real. The question is whether the motivation runs deep enough to sustain years of grinding through hotel PMS updates, brand compliance changes, and a well-funded competitor eating into your market.
