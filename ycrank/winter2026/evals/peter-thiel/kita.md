# Kita -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask about any company is what truth it sees that the consensus rejects. Kita's thesis -- that emerging market lenders need automated document processing because open banking infrastructure is absent -- is not a secret. It is an observation. No serious person in fintech would argue that Philippine and Indonesian lenders have adequate document automation. No one disputes that e-wallet adoption is surging or that half the Philippines remains unbanked. The entire financial inclusion ecosystem -- from development banks to impact investors to the IFC -- has been saying this for a decade. When everyone agrees on both the problem and the direction of the solution, you are not building on a secret; you are entering a market where the absence of existing solutions reflects the difficulty of the business, not the non-obviousness of the opportunity. This distinction matters enormously, because companies built on consensus insights compete, and companies that compete destroy their own margins.

The competitive landscape confirms the diagnosis. Ocrolus has raised $142 million and reached $20 million in ARR processing US financial documents. Hyperscience has raised $439 million for general document automation. Docsumo has built $10.3 million in revenue on $3.72 million raised -- a capital efficiency that suggests the underlying technology is not prohibitively hard. Kita's differentiation is geographic: it processes emerging market documents rather than American ones. Geographic arbitrage is not a monopoly strategy. It is a timing advantage that erodes as soon as the market becomes visibly attractive. When Philippine lending volume crosses a threshold that makes it interesting to Ocrolus or to a well-funded Asian fintech, Kita's localization lead becomes a matter of months, not years. The structural barrier -- "training data, document formats, and fraud typologies are sufficiently different" -- is real but surmountable. It is a localization effort, not a technological impossibility.

The technology itself illustrates the problem. Kita applies vision-language models to document extraction -- a capability that is improving rapidly across the entire AI ecosystem. GPT-4V, Gemini, and a growing ecosystem of open-source VLMs are making document understanding a commodity capability. The dossier acknowledges this directly. When the core technology is riding a general wave of model improvement that any competitor can access, you need something else to create structural defensibility. Kita's candidate for that something else is the lending-outcome feedback loop -- connecting document signals to repayment data to build proprietary credit intelligence. This is the most interesting idea in the company, and it is where a genuine secret could emerge: that the path to credit infrastructure for the unbanked runs through document processing, not through traditional scoring or open banking APIs. If Kita is actually building a proprietary credit scoring system for populations that have never been scored, disguised as a document processing platform, that would be a non-obvious and important insight. But the company describes itself as a "document intelligence platform," not a credit intelligence engine. The feedback loop is architectural, not yet a proven data moat -- with a handful of customers and unknown processing volume, the compounding advantage is aspirational.

The founders deserve credit where it is due. Carmel Limcaoco's Manila roots give her native context that a San Francisco team parachuting into Southeast Asia would lack. She has built and shipped before -- three Apple internships, a prior startup, the biographical indicators of someone who executes rather than theorizes. Rhea Malhotra's Firestone Medal for the best honors thesis in Stanford's CS department is a genuine signal of intellectual horsepower, and her published research in computer vision and robotics is directly relevant to the technical problem. These are strong credentials for a pre-seed team. But credentials and conviction are different things. I do not see evidence of a definite vision -- a specific, concrete articulation of what the world looks like if Kita succeeds at scale. "Turn documents into signals for lenders" is a product description, not a vision of the future. Compare this to what I look for: Zuckerberg knew Facebook would become the social graph for humanity. Musk knew reusable rockets would make humans multiplanetary. What does Kita know about the future that no one else sees?

The bull case is worth articulating honestly. If the lending-outcome feedback loop compounds as designed, Kita could evolve from document processing into the de facto credit bureau for emerging markets -- the entity that determines creditworthiness for billions of people who currently have none. In that scenario, the data moat deepens with every loan decision, creating the kind of proprietary intelligence that is structurally impossible to replicate without years of accumulated outcomes data. The beachhead strategy -- Philippines first, then Indonesia, then Mexico -- is well-chosen and follows the concentric expansion pattern I value. Thirty percent month-over-month growth and a six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage indicate genuine market pull. If Kita can lock in lender integrations deeply enough that switching costs compound, and if the credit intelligence layer becomes the actual product rather than the document processing, this could become a durable monopoly in emerging market credit infrastructure. That company would be worth investing in. But I am being asked to evaluate the company as it presents itself today, not the company it might become if a secret emerges from within its architecture.

The small-market entry is the strongest element of the strategy from my perspective. The Philippines is a specific, bounded market where Carmel has native relationships and context. Dominating Philippine lending document processing before expanding to Indonesia and Mexico follows the pattern I have seen work -- Amazon with books, Facebook with Harvard, PayPal with eBay power sellers. The question is whether "Philippine lending document processing" is a market that can be truly monopolized, or whether it is simply a small market that stays small. The expansion from country to country requires re-localization each time -- different document types, different fraud patterns, different regulatory regimes -- which means the monopoly must be rebuilt in each geography rather than extending naturally through network effects or scale economics.

I pass on Kita. The company addresses a real problem with a capable team, but it lacks the essential ingredient: a contrarian truth that creates a structural path to monopoly. Document processing for emerging market lenders is a good business, but good businesses are not what I invest in. I invest in companies that will be the last mover in their category -- companies whose position becomes more unassailable with every passing year. Kita's position becomes more vulnerable with every improvement in general-purpose vision-language models. Unless the founders are building something deeper than what they have articulated -- a credit intelligence monopoly hiding inside a document processing wrapper -- this is a company that will compete, and I know how that story ends.
