# o11 -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about o11 is the competitive landscape, and it's not encouraging. Rogo has raised $165M+ at a $750M valuation with J.P. Morgan as an investor. Hebbia has raised $161M at a $700M valuation and is generating $13M ARR. AlphaSense has raised $1.39B. These aren't early-stage competitors -- they're well-capitalized companies with established enterprise relationships in exactly the market o11 is entering. When I write about "market-ending moves," I'm describing situations where a category leader has compounding distribution advantages that make late entry structurally difficult. AI for capital markets isn't quite there yet -- there's no single winner -- but the funded competitive density means o11 is bringing a $500K pre-seed war chest to a fight where three players already have 300-1000x more capital. That's not a non-obvious market at an inflection point. That's a consensus-hot category where every investor in the Valley is trying to place bets.

The M365-embedded positioning is the company's strongest strategic argument, and I want to take it seriously. The insight that bankers live in Excel and PowerPoint, not in standalone web apps, is correct. Rogo and Hebbia both built their own interfaces, which means users have to context-switch. o11 meets users where the work happens. This is a genuine distribution insight. But here's what I see that concerns me: o11 is building on someone else's platform, and the platform owner is Microsoft. When I talk about product-to-distribution, I mean companies that become distribution channels themselves -- Stripe owns the developer relationship, Figma owns the designer workflow. o11 doesn't own its distribution channel; it's borrowing Microsoft's. Microsoft controls the add-in APIs, the pricing, the policies, and could restrict or deprecate third-party add-ins at any point. Worse, Microsoft could add vertical financial connectors to Copilot directly. Building your entire company as a feature inside someone else's platform is the inverse of what I look for -- it's distribution dependency, not distribution ownership.

The domain expertise gap is a real concern that compounds the competitive problem. Neither founder has investment banking, private equity, or wealth management experience. Capital markets professionals are among the most demanding enterprise users -- they have specific formatting requirements for pitch decks, exact conventions for financial models (DCF, LBO, comps), and institutional workflows that vary by firm. When Rogo builds financial reasoning models, they do it with investors and bankers embedded in their product development. o11's founders are 19-20 years old, dropped out of UNC-Chapel Hill, and their strongest AI credential is Ajay leading AI at Cal AI -- a consumer calorie-tracking app. Cal AI scaling to $40M ARR with 10M users is a legitimate execution signal, but it's a completely different problem domain. Consumer mobile AI and enterprise capital markets workflow automation share almost nothing in common beyond using neural networks. This feels like a company that needs multiple miracles: deep M365 integration quality, financial domain expertise they don't currently have, enterprise sales capability to compete with Rogo and Hebbia, and avoiding platform risk from Microsoft. That's four concurrent obstacles, not one.

The bull case I'd need to believe: Microsoft Copilot remains permanently horizontal and never adds financial data connectors, Rogo and Hebbia never build M365 add-ins (despite having the resources to do so easily), o11's PLG motion drives bottom-up adoption in banks that bypasses the enterprise sales motions their competitors excel at, and the founders develop deep capital markets domain expertise through rapid customer iteration. If all of this were true, the M365-embedded wedge could become a genuine distribution moat -- individual bankers adopt o11 through the free tier, usage spreads within teams, and by the time Rogo notices, o11 has organic adoption across dozens of firms. The 150 reviews and institutional user logos (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Yale, Duke) suggest early individual adoption is happening. But this bull case requires every assumption to break right simultaneously, and the competitive dynamics are moving against them -- Hebbia acquired FlashDocs in July 2025 specifically to add document-to-draft capabilities, which is o11's core value proposition.

The technology cycle positioning is late rather than early. Harvey worked because they built legal AI workflow tools before GPT-4 existed, positioning ahead of the capability curve. o11 is building financial AI tools after the capability curve has already arrived and after multiple well-funded competitors have established themselves. There's no technology gap they're exploiting that others haven't already exploited. The "why now" amounts to "LLMs are good enough and financial firms want AI" -- which is the most consensus thesis in venture capital right now. I specifically look for companies building at the moment when most investors think the market is impossible. This market looks very possible to everyone, which is why it's attracted $1.5B+ in competitive funding.

I respect the execution velocity -- having a shipped product with published pricing, 150 reviews, and recognizable institutional user logos at pre-seed is real. But execution speed in a structurally disadvantaged position just means you arrive at the wall faster. This is a pass for me.
