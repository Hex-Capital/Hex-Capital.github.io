# Beyond Reach Labs -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The specific knowledge here is as clean as I've seen at pre-seed. Mitchell Fogelson didn't study deployable space structures -- he *invented* the deployable space structures this company sells. His PhD at CMU, funded by a NASA NIAC grant, produced the exact scissor-truss metamaterial architectures -- PETS and HERDS -- that Beyond Reach Labs is commercializing. He ran zero-gravity parabolic flight experiments to validate them. That's not domain expertise. That's the kind of knowledge that took years of original research to create and would take a competitor years to replicate, assuming they could replicate it at all. Pele Collins spent seven years at SpaceX qualifying human-rated deployable mechanical systems -- the Crew Dragon parachutes that brought NASA astronauts home. He knows the difference between a mechanism that works in a lab and one that works in the vacuum of space with human lives depending on it. These two have known each other thirteen years, share the same engineering DNA from UPenn, and their knowledge is genuinely complementary: one invented the structure, the other knows how to get it flight-qualified. This is founder-problem fit at the physics layer.

What I find most interesting is the leverage architecture, which is unusual for a hardware company. Beyond Reach Labs isn't building satellites -- they're building the power subsystem that every satellite, space station, and orbital datacenter needs. This is a picks-and-shovels play for the orbital economy. Just as Alchemy provides developer infrastructure for every blockchain application without building the applications themselves, Beyond Reach Labs provides power infrastructure for every orbital platform without operating those platforms. The patent-pending PETS and HERDS designs are the leverage mechanism -- one engineering team's structural optimization multiplied across an entire industry's power requirements. The 20:1 extension ratio means a structure that fits in 1.25 square meters produces 12.5 kW once deployed. That's a form of physical leverage -- encoding engineering intelligence into geometry so that the deployment itself creates disproportionate capability from minimal launch mass. The limitation is manufacturing, which scales linearly. But the design IP and flight heritage, once established, create asymmetric returns on each production unit.

The contrarian timing deserves attention. Most capital is flowing into AI software -- wrappers, copilots, agents. Building physical hardware for space is deeply unfashionable. But the thesis underneath is that compute is moving to orbit, and compute requires power, and power in space is the binding constraint. SpaceX filed for a million-satellite orbital datacenter constellation. Google announced Project Suncatcher. Starcloud proposed 88,000 orbital datacenter satellites needing 5 GW by 2035. Current satellites collectively use 20 MW. That's a 500x demand increase driven by the migration of AI compute infrastructure into space -- and legacy solar array architectures structurally cannot serve it. Redwire's ROSA roll-out blankets sacrifice rigidity at the lengths these applications require. The bet is that orbital compute will create power demand at a scale that demands a fundamentally different structural approach. If you believe compute is the defining constraint of the AI era -- and I do -- then power infrastructure for orbital compute sits at the right layer. The non-consensus element isn't space solar itself; it's the specific claim that scissor-truss metamaterials are the correct structural solution and that now, before any orbital datacenter has launched, is the right time to build.

The real risk is demand timing. $175M+ in LOIs is an extraordinary signal for a two-person pre-seed company, but LOIs in space are vapor until they convert to binding contracts, and space procurement cycles run in years. The orbital datacenter thesis -- SpaceX, Starcloud, Google -- is still projections, not deployed infrastructure. If orbital datacenters slip five years, Beyond Reach Labs burns through capital waiting for a market that hasn't materialized. The capital intensity of qualifying space hardware -- thermal vacuum, vibration, radiation testing -- is brutal. A two-person team with pre-seed funding will need multiple significant raises before reaching production. This is a multi-year journey through a valley of death that kills most hardware startups. The innovator's dilemma protects them from Redwire in theory, but Redwire has $304M in revenue and could develop competing architectures if the market grows large enough to justify cannibalization.

Still, this maps to a pattern I've been investing into since 2022 -- deep-science hardware bets at the compute infrastructure layer. Extropic, Atomic Semi, Belfort -- speculative physics-first companies where the technology, if it works, creates capability that didn't exist before. Beyond Reach Labs fits this pattern. The specific knowledge is non-transferable. The technology compounds -- each flight heritage demonstration raises the qualification barrier for competitors. The positioning is infrastructure, not application. And the founders chose the hard path, building atoms in space instead of shipping software, which signals the kind of long-term orientation that compound interest rewards. I'd make this bet -- sized appropriately for the hardware risk and demand uncertainty -- because the founders' knowledge of the problem is genuine and the physics of the opportunity are clear. When compute moves to orbit, someone has to solve power. These are the people most qualified to solve it.
