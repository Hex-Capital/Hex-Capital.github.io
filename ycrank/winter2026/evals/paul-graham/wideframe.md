# Wideframe -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Daniel Pearson spent ten years running a growth marketing agency that produced video ads for over 175 brands. Then he shut it down. Not because it failed -- because he found the real problem. That's the kind of origin story I pay attention to. When someone has been sitting inside a broken workflow for a decade, watching video teams burn 75% of their time on tasks *around* the actual editing -- scrubbing footage, writing briefs, organizing clips, chasing feedback -- and then decides to build the tool they wished existed, that's not a manufactured startup idea. That's organic discovery. Pearson didn't read a trend report about AI video tools and brainstorm his way into this. He lived in the pain long enough that building Wideframe was the natural next step, the way Dropbox was the natural next step for someone who kept forgetting his USB drive.

What makes this more interesting is the schlep structure. Look at where every other AI video startup is competing: generation (Runway, Sora), clip repurposing (OpusClip), or transcript-based editing (Descript). Those are the glamorous problems. Nobody wants to build for the ugly middle -- the footage indexing, the rough-cut assembly, the round-trip with Adobe's undocumented .prproj format. That's exactly the pattern I described in "Schlep Blindness": the problem everyone in the industry knows about but unconsciously avoids because the work is tedious, unsexy, and involves navigating proprietary format dependencies that could break at any time. The fact that Wideframe is deliberately positioning *outside* the NLE rather than trying to replace it is a smart structural choice. It means Adobe is less likely to view them as a threat and more likely to tolerate (or eventually embrace) the integration. Adobe's entire incentive is to keep users inside Premiere Pro -- building a product that says "most of your editors' time is spent outside our software" would be an awkward admission.

The co-founder pairing is strong. Zachary Kim is a genuine hacker -- nearly twenty years of engineering, CTO at Zaarly, co-founded Float (YC S21), and he's got 1.1k stars on ClojureDocs, which tells me he builds things because he likes building things. The two of them overlapped at Zaarly, so this isn't a co-founder relationship that started with a matching service or a pitch competition. They have a real working history. Kim has already shipped a working desktop app that does semantic video indexing and reads/writes .prproj files natively. That's not a demo -- that's a product. Reverse-engineering Adobe's proprietary format requires genuine technical craft, not just plugging into an API.

The early traction -- 50+ brands and agencies in 75 days -- is a meaningful signal at this stage, though I want to know more about depth. Are these teams using Wideframe daily? Is it replacing an existing workflow, or is it something they tried during a free trial and haven't come back to? The testimonial from Goodo Studios ("save each of our editors 2 hours per day") suggests real utility, but one testimonial is one data point. The absence of any revenue signal is the gap that concerns me most. If teams are genuinely saving 2 hours per editor per day, they should be willing to pay for that, and I'd want to see even a small number converting from free trials to paid seats.

The bull case for Wideframe is that this is a picks-and-shovels play in a gold rush. While everyone fights over who will be the best AI video generator, Wideframe is building infrastructure for the people who already have footage and just need to work with it more efficiently. The market is real -- brands and agencies producing tens or hundreds of videos per week for social platforms is a structural shift that isn't going away. And Pearson's agency network gives him a warm distribution channel that most pre-seed founders would kill for. If the product delivers on the promise of saving editors hours per day, word of mouth through agency networks could drive organic growth without paid acquisition. The foundation model dependency and Adobe format risks are real, but they're the kind of risks that come with the territory of building something genuinely useful on top of rapidly improving infrastructure. The bear case -- that this is an "AI wrapper" that could be replicated -- misses the workflow knowledge embedded in the product. Knowing which tasks to automate and how they connect to the NLE round-trip is domain expertise, not just API calls.

Where I land: the organic problem discovery is among the strongest I've seen at this stage. Pearson is not building in a domain he studied -- he's building in a domain he inhabited for a decade. The schlep is real and structurally deters competition. The technical co-founder is a builder with a track record. The early customer numbers are encouraging if thin on depth. The main gap is the absence of any revenue evidence, which at 75 days post-launch with 50+ customers should be emerging if the value proposition is converting. I'd invest, but I'd want a conversation about pricing and conversion before writing the check.
