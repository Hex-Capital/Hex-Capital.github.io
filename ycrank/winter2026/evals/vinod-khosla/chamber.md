# Chamber -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

NVIDIA acquired Run:ai for $700 million and then open-sourced it. That single fact tells you almost everything about the structural position Chamber is trying to occupy. When the dominant hardware monopolist buys the leading software orchestrator and gives it away for free, they're making a statement: GPU orchestration is a feature of the hardware ecosystem, not a standalone business. Chamber is building a company in a space where the most powerful player in the world just signaled that the software layer should be commoditized to sell more chips. That's not a market gap — that's a market being deliberately collapsed.

Let me start where I always start: if Chamber succeeds completely, what happens? Enterprise GPU clusters go from 40-60% utilization to something higher. Companies save money on compute. The $240 billion waste figure sounds impressive, but the consequence of success is that the same companies run the same workloads on the same infrastructure, just more efficiently. Nobody's life changes. No industry gets disrupted. No incumbent becomes obsolete. This is the archetype of what I warn founders about — optimizing an existing system by 30-40% is a spreadsheet improvement, not a transformation. Compare this to what excited me about Juniper: we weren't making Cisco's routers 30% faster, we were replacing the entire routing architecture with TCP/IP. Chamber isn't replacing GPU infrastructure — it's making the existing infrastructure slightly less wasteful. The consequence of maximum success is a useful business, not an industry that operates fundamentally differently.

The founding team compounds my concern rather than alleviating it. Four Amazon veterans who built AWS CloudWatch and observability tools, now building GPU monitoring and orchestration. This is the pattern I've seen fail my investment thesis most reliably — domain experts extracting their employer's playbook into a startup. They know exactly what's possible and exactly what's not, which means they'll execute competently within the boundaries of what Amazon already validated. Charles Ding is a second-time founder, which I respect — Bungee Tech to 30+ engineers and $3M raised shows he can build. But there's no outsider perspective here, no contrarian thesis, no one on this team who would approach GPU infrastructure from a direction that the entire industry considers impossible. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, aerospace experts told me a New Zealander with no pedigree couldn't build a launch vehicle. Who is telling Chamber their approach is crazy? Nobody — because it isn't. It's sensible infrastructure software built by infrastructure experts.

The strongest bull case deserves honest engagement. GPU compute is arguably becoming the most strategically important resource in the global economy — spending up 166% year-over-year, supply constrained, and the foundation for everything AI. If Chamber becomes the autonomous "operating system" for all GPU clusters globally, that's a genuinely strategic position. The Run:ai open-sourcing creates a vacuum: the open-source version lacks dedicated commercial support and the agentic autonomous capabilities Chamber claims to offer. Enterprise buyers with on-prem and hybrid GPU deployments have a real pain point that cloud-specific tools can't address. And the timing window is real — right now, enterprises are scrambling to manage GPU fleets with duct tape and Kubernetes primitives. If the "agentic AI" orchestration layer genuinely works autonomously — predicting failures, reallocating resources, optimizing across teams without human intervention — that could be meaningfully differentiated from open-source schedulers that require constant manual tuning. But that's a lot of "ifs," and every one of them is an execution challenge, not a technology breakthrough.

The technology itself is where Chamber falls furthest from what excites me. GPU monitoring, workload scheduling, fault detection, fair-share allocation — these are well-understood infrastructure engineering problems. Calling it "agentic AI-enabled" doesn't change the underlying reality: this is better tooling applied to known problems. Volcano and Kueue are maturing from below as open-source Kubernetes primitives. Any well-funded infrastructure company — Datadog, HashiCorp, even NVIDIA itself — could build competing capabilities with sufficient engineering talent. There's no physics breakthrough here, no 10x cost reduction through a novel mechanism, no capability that didn't exist before. The differentiation is in integration quality and autonomous behavior, which are real engineering achievements but not structural moats. I've learned from painful experience — KiOR taught me that technology achievement without defensible economics is a trap. Chamber's technology achieves competence without achieving disruption.

I respect the team's execution capability and the market's genuine pain, but this is precisely the kind of investment I pass on. Four smart people have reduced the probability of failure to the point where the consequences of success are a solid infrastructure software company in a crowded, commoditizing market. The ambition is calibrated to the founders' comfort zone, not to the scale of the problem. If I'm going to bet on AI infrastructure, I want to bet on something that changes what's computationally possible — not something that makes existing computation 40% cheaper.
