# Sequence Markets -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything about what kind of bet this actually is. Talos just raised at $1.5 billion with Robinhood as a strategic investor in January 2026. FalconX acquired 21Shares in October 2025 on an $8 billion valuation. CoinRoutes holds a patent specifically on smart order routing in crypto. And Sequence Markets is a team of five, mostly early-career, building sub-millisecond execution infrastructure against these players. When I look at my portfolio — Coinbase, Stripe, PagerDuty — the common thread wasn't entering a market where well-capitalized incumbents were actively expanding. It was entering a market where either no serious infrastructure existed yet or where the incumbents were structurally unable to compete. The structural vacancy matters as much as the structural moment.

The "why now" for institutional crypto execution is real — I'll give it that. MiCA best-execution mandates going live in mid-2024 create genuine regulatory demand for provable best execution, analogous to how MiFID II drove TCA adoption in traditional equities. Tokenization of real-world assets fragmenting liquidity across more venues makes routing complexity grow combinatorially. These are structural shifts, not marketing narratives. But here's the problem: these are consensus shifts. When Robinhood puts capital into Talos at $1.5 billion, the market is telling you loudly that institutional execution infrastructure is a recognized opportunity. This is not PagerDuty in 2010, where operations alerting seemed too boring for anyone to fund. This is a market where over $600 million has been deployed into direct competitors. The "too boring" or "too niche" archetype doesn't apply — this is well-understood fintech infrastructure with well-funded competitors.

The bull case rests on an innovator's dilemma argument: Talos and FalconX have moved upmarket into full prime brokerage — custody, credit, clearing — and can't unbundle a lightweight execution-only layer without cannibalizing their higher-margin bundles. A venue-neutral, non-custodial execution layer could win the segment of institutions that want routing technology without counterparty exposure. Post-FTX, the non-custodial architecture is genuinely differentiated positioning. And as tokenization proliferates asset types, execution complexity grows faster than any single prime broker can vertically integrate. If you believe this wedge is real and durable, Peter Bai's TMX Group and pension fund ($12.8B AUM) experience in market microstructure gives legitimate domain credibility for building it. This is the version of the company I'd want to exist. But it requires believing that incumbents can't simply offer an execution-only tier, that CoinRoutes' patent doesn't block the core approach, and that institutional clients will trust a team of five over established platforms — that's at least two miracles stacked, which is where my conviction breaks down.

The "AI-powered routing" claim is where I'd push hardest in a meeting. Smart order routing and liquidity aggregation are thoroughly understood concepts in traditional equities — Virtu and Citadel Securities have been doing this for decades. Calling it "AI-powered" without published benchmarks, research, or even a public GitHub presence makes this feel software-aware rather than software-driven. What specific AI technique produces better fills than the statistical routing models CoinRoutes has patented? Without a verifiable technical answer, the differentiation claim is marketing, not moat. I need to see that the technology compounds in a way that creates structural advantage over time — accumulated routing data improving execution quality in a measurable feedback loop — and there's no evidence of that here.

On product-to-distribution trajectory: the non-custodial execution layer could theoretically expand into compliance reporting, TCA analytics, portfolio risk management — becoming the infrastructure layer that institutions embed deeply enough to distribute additional products through. The B2B2B integration model (plugging into existing brokers and custodial platforms) is the right architectural instinct for distribution leverage. But there's no evidence the founders have articulated this multi-product vision, and execution-only technology is notoriously commoditizable in traditional markets. If the product remains a single routing layer, any broker or exchange can build or buy equivalent capability — which is exactly what's happening as Talos acquires Coin Metrics for market data integration.

I pass here. The market timing thesis has genuine substance — tokenization-driven venue fragmentation plus regulatory best-execution mandates is a real structural shift. But the structural moment is creating opportunity for funded incumbents, not a vacuum for new entrants. The team has relevant domain background but is early-career, building against competitors with orders-of-magnitude more engineering capacity and institutional relationships. The single miracle isn't clearly identified — is it winning institutional distribution? Building defensible AI routing? Navigating the patent landscape? When I can't name the one miracle in one sentence, the plan likely requires multiple breakthroughs, and compounding low-probability events is how pre-seed companies die.
