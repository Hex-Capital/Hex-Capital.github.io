# Fed10 -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Fed10 is that it's exactly the kind of company every investor in San Francisco is excited about right now. "AI agents that replace your consultants" -- I could walk into any coffee shop in SoMa and hear three founders pitching this exact framing across three different verticals. That's not inherently damning, but it's the opposite of the signal I've trained myself to follow. The companies that have made my career -- SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe -- were the ones that made other investors squirm. Nobody was running toward ride-sharing when it was illegal or Bitcoin mining on gas flares. When I look at Fed10, I see a well-reasoned application of current technology to a known market, and my honest reaction is that it lacks the quality of strangeness that gets my attention. USLege raised $2.7 million for essentially the same thesis seven months before Fed10's YC batch. FiscalNote and Quorum are bolting AI features onto platforms with thousands of existing enterprise customers. This is a crowded, legible, consensus category -- and that tells me the pricing and the positioning have already been competed away before Fed10 even gets to market.

When I try to hear the founders' stories, I find something different from what I typically look for. Armand was the youngest Governor appointee in Nevada, passed legislation before he could vote, studied Government at Harvard. Zayan received an Amazon offer at seventeen, studied CS at Berkeley. Winston dual-majored in CS and Political Science at Williams and worked government affairs for Nevada Democrats. These are genuinely impressive early achievements -- precocious, high-performing, well-credentialed. But I keep waiting to hear the part where something broke, where the world said no and they had to claw their way through anyway. I'm listening for the specific hardship that fused them to this problem at an identity level, and what I hear instead is a natural career progression: smart young people who worked in government, went to elite schools, and now want to apply AI to the process they know well. That's rational and defensible, but it doesn't tell me they'll be the ones still standing when USLege has more funding, FiscalNote launches a competing agent product, and their first enterprise customer churns because the AI mischaracterized a bill's fiscal impact.

The strongest thing Fed10 has going for it is the co-founder relationship and the genuine domain fit. Three best friends who passed legislation together in Nevada before starting a company together -- that's the kind of battle-tested foundation I've learned to value since HQ Trivia taught me what happens when co-founders haven't been through real stress as a unit. These three have actually done the work their AI is trying to automate, which means they can evaluate output quality in a way that pure technologists cannot. If I'm building the bull case, it's this: the incumbents face a real innovator's dilemma (FiscalNote's human analyst overlay is revenue they'd cannibalize by going full AI), the market is large and growing ($5.24 billion in federal lobbying spend alone), and founders who've physically sat in committee hearings and drafted bill language have an intuitive sense of what "good" looks like that's hard to replicate with prompt engineering alone. A smaller trade association or advocacy group that currently can't afford $500/hour policy consultants could genuinely benefit from affordable AI-driven analysis -- there's a real democratization story buried in here.

But even granting all of that, I keep returning to the core problem: the technology itself is reproducible. LLMs analyzing legislative text is not a technical moat. The dossier identifies this directly -- "the core technology is reproducible by any team with access to foundation models and legislative data feeds." What I look for in hard spaces is the kind of complexity that structurally deters competition, the way FDA pathways protect Contraline or defense procurement protects Anduril. Legislative text is public data. The analysis methodology can be replicated. The CRM and workflow features create some switching costs over time, but those take years to build into a meaningful moat, and FiscalNote and Quorum already have thousands of customers embedded in their workflows. I don't see Fed10 making an invisible system visible -- legislative text is already public. What's truly invisible in this industry is the influence network, the back-channel dynamics, the real reasons bills move or die. If Fed10 were building something that mapped and exposed those hidden power structures, I'd feel very differently. But faster analysis of public documents, while valuable, is a productivity tool, not a transparency revolution.

I'm passing on this one. The founders are clearly capable and their domain experience is real, but nothing about Fed10 activates the intuition I've learned to trust. It's popular when I want unpopular. It's credentialed where I want scarred. It serves already-resourced institutions rather than creating new economic access. And in a category where three well-funded competitors are already operating, the path to defensibility requires the kind of sustained execution advantage that I'd need a much stronger biographical conviction signal to bet on with my own money.
