# o11 -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about o11 is that it's operating in one of the hottest, most crowded categories in all of tech right now: AI for financial services. Rogo has raised $165 million and has J.P. Morgan as an investor. Hebbia has $161 million and $13 million in ARR. AlphaSense has raised over a billion. Microsoft itself is building Copilot into the exact same Office apps o11 targets. When I see a pre-seed company with a team of four entering a market where competitors have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and count the biggest banks as investors, I don't think "exciting opportunity." I think "why here, why you?" And the answer to that question takes me to the problem origin, which is where I always start.

How did these founders find this problem? Neither Aryah nor Ajay has ever worked in investment banking, private equity, or wealth management. Aryah is 19 and was studying business and CS at UNC. Ajay was doing AI work at a calorie-tracking app and ML research at Mayo Clinic. The company's own blog says "bankers, lawyers, and consultants told us they were tired of chat bots that couldn't do real work." That's the origin story right there -- not "I was pulling all-nighters building pitch decks at Goldman and realized this was insane," but "we talked to people who told us about their problem." That's market research, not organic discovery. The difference matters enormously when you're building for a domain as specialized as capital markets. A DCF model isn't just a spreadsheet with formulas. An LBO analysis at 2am for a partner who wants it a specific way isn't just document generation. The domain knowledge gap here isn't trivial -- it's the kind of thing that causes products to be 80% right and 100% unusable, because in finance the last 20% is where all the value lives.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. The M365 add-in approach is genuinely clever. Hebbia and Rogo built standalone platforms, which means users have to leave Excel and PowerPoint -- the tools where deliverables actually get produced -- to use them. o11 meets users inside the application they're already in. That's the kind of distribution insight that sounds obvious after someone points it out. And the technical schlep of deep M365 integration across three applications, with formatting preservation and financial data connectors, is real engineering work that most teams would rather avoid. Ajay's experience shipping AI at Cal AI ($40M ARR, 10M users) suggests he can build production-grade AI products, not just prototypes. If I squint, I can see a path where the M365-native approach creates enough workflow stickiness that even well-funded standalone competitors can't displace it. For this to work, the founders would need to develop genuinely deep domain expertise fast enough to build what capital markets professionals actually need, while simultaneously staying ahead of Microsoft's own vertical ambitions for Copilot. That's two miracles, not one.

On the evidence-of-wanting front, I see 150 reviews at 4.8 stars -- but on their own website, not G2 or a third-party platform. Logos from Wells Fargo and Bank of America appear on the site, but the dossier notes these likely indicate individual users, not enterprise contracts. There's a meaningful difference between a junior analyst at Bank of America downloading a free add-in and Bank of America's technology team approving an enterprise deployment. The free tier likely explains most of the adoption -- it's easy to get individuals to try something free, much harder to convert that into the enterprise contracts that actually matter in financial services.

Ajay is clearly technical and has shipped real products. The GitHub profiles are modest but that's not unusual. What concerns me more is the pattern of the whole thing. Two smart, young, energetic founders notice that AI is hot, financial services is a big market, and M365 integration is underserved. They build a product. The technology works. The market is large. But when I apply the test I keep coming back to -- would these founders have built this product if they hadn't decided to start a startup? -- the answer seems clearly no. This idea exists because they went looking for a startup idea in a hot category, not because they couldn't stop thinking about investment banking workflows. That's the pattern I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas." The motivation architecture is wrong, and motivation architecture is what carries you through the years of painful iteration that separate promising demos from companies that win.
