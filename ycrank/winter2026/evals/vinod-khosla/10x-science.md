# 10x Science -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's a team from a Nobel laureate's lab, with 50+ publications and two US patents between them, building better analytical software for the exact workflow they've been doing for years. That is the pattern that gives me pause. David Roberts has a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry, trained under Carolyn Bertozzi, published extensively on top-down mass spectrometry and proteoform characterization. Andrew Reiter built methods at the Broad Institute's Proteomics Platform. These are the foremost experts in this precise domain. And my instinct — refined over four decades — is that experts in a field are the least likely people to reinvent it. They know too well what Protein Metrics does, what BioPharma Finder does, what the competitive dynamics look like. That knowledge constrains their ambition to building a better version of the existing toolset rather than making the existing approach obsolete.

Let me address the consequence question directly. If 10x Science fully succeeds — automates all protein characterization, becomes the universal analytical platform for biologics — what changes? Biopharma companies characterize drug candidates 10x faster and cheaper. That is a useful business. But the pharmaceutical pipeline still requires clinical trials, still requires FDA approval, still requires manufacturing at scale. You've unclogged one pipe in a system with a dozen sequential bottlenecks. The software-only TAM in this space is likely hundreds of millions, not billions. Compare that to Square opening mobile payments to 30 million small businesses who had no payment infrastructure, or Impossible Foods attempting to displace a $1.7 trillion meat industry. The magnitude here is a good enterprise SaaS business with $50-200M revenue potential. That outcome doesn't justify the caliber of this team. These founders are too talented to spend their careers making peptide mapping 10x faster.

The strongest bull case, and I want to be honest about it, is timing. The AI-driven drug design explosion — AlphaFold, RFdiffusion, generative protein platforms — is flooding the development pipeline with novel protein therapeutics. This is a genuine demand-side shock. If ten times more drug candidates need characterization and the legacy tools can't handle the volume, 10x Science could become essential infrastructure at exactly the right moment. The transformer-based approaches to mass spec fragmentation prediction have only recently become feasible — this is a company positioned ahead of a technology curve that's clearly accelerating. If I squint, I can see a world where AI-designed biologics become the dominant modality for new drugs, and 10x Science becomes the analytical backbone for that entire category. But even in that optimistic scenario, you're building critical infrastructure for someone else's revolution, not the revolution itself. You're selling pickaxes. The pickaxe seller in a gold rush can build a real business, but they don't reshape civilization.

The team construction is, I'll admit, thoughtfully done. Two domain scientists who deeply understand the pain of protein characterization, paired with a CTO who has scaled a product at a YC-backed company through a $43M Series B at Nooks. That's deliberate gene pool engineering — proteomics depth plus engineering scale. But it surfaces a structural tension: the domain founders are insiders whose expertise may make them excellent at building what Protein Metrics should have built, rather than something Protein Metrics couldn't conceive of. The instrument-agnostic angle has real structural merit — Thermo Fisher and Waters can't unbundle their software from their hardware without cannibalizing their razor-blade model — so there's a legitimate opening. But Dotmatics already has 200+ biopharma customers and can add AI to Byonic. The competitive moat here is the founders' scientific credibility and the data flywheel they might build, not a fundamentally different approach to the problem.

I pass on this one. Not because it's a bad company — the team is exceptional, the timing is favorable, and the technology approach is sound. I pass because the consequence of success is a well-run enterprise software business in a mid-size market, not the transformation of an industry. I've watched too many brilliant scientists build incrementally better tools for their own discipline when they could have been attempting something the world said was impossible. If Roberts told me he was using his proteomics expertise to build an AI system that eliminates the need for clinical trials altogether, or that replaces mass spectrometry as a characterization modality, I'd lean forward. Instead, he's building better mass spectrometry analysis software. The probability of success is higher. The consequence of success is proportionally smaller.
