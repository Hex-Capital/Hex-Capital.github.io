# Wayco -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first question I always ask is: how did the founder find this problem? A 19-year-old competitive coding prodigy from Tajikistan, with exits in augmented reality education and government tech, is now building an AI-powered referral network for American personal injury lawyers. I've looked at the dossier carefully for the organic backstory -- the moment where this founder personally encountered the broken referral process, the frustrated call to a law firm that went unanswered at 9pm, the firsthand experience navigating state bar referral fee rules. It's not there. Based on everything publicly available, this looks like a founder who identified a large, fragmented market through analysis and decided to build for it. That's exactly the pattern I described in "How to Get Startup Ideas" -- sitting down to think of startup ideas rather than stumbling into one through lived experience. The problem is real. The market is large. But the connection between this specific founder and this specific problem appears manufactured.

The irony is that the schlep here is genuinely enormous -- and genuinely the kind that creates schlep blindness. State-by-state bar referral fee regulations, unauthorized practice of law risks, multi-jurisdictional compliance, the cold-start problem of building law firm network density market by market. This is exactly the kind of ugly, regulatory, trust-heavy problem that causes smart founders to look away. The stated strategy of becoming a law firm itself is, structurally, a fascinating move -- it's the kind of decision that would create a moat no pure-software competitor could replicate. But understanding the schlep intellectually and having navigated it personally are different things. When the Collisons built Stripe, they'd been dealing with payment integration pain as developers for years before they decided to fix it. When Tony Xu built DoorDash, he personally delivered hundreds of meals. I see no equivalent domain immersion here. The dossier explicitly notes "no documented legal-domain expertise," and no advisors or early hires with legal backgrounds are publicly identified.

What makes this genuinely hard to pass on is the founder. Iqbol Temirkhojaev's biography reads like someone who was built to start companies. Competitive coding gold medals starting at age 11. A VC-backed startup at 13. An acquisition by the United Nations at 14. A software patent at 15. A presidential medal at 16. Getting from Tajikistan to YC with $1.5M from Sequoia Scout and angels from ElevenLabs and Groq at 19. That trajectory demonstrates something real -- not just intelligence, but the combination of determination and creative problem-solving that gets you from a small Central Asian country with no startup ecosystem into the heart of Silicon Valley's most selective accelerator. Jared Friedman calling him "one of the most interesting backgrounds" carries weight. These are signals I take seriously.

But here's where my framework forces a harder look. This is a solo founder building a two-sided marketplace that requires navigating complex state-by-state regulation. Solo founders already face my strongest structural objection -- I made Drew Houston find a co-founder for Dropbox, and Dropbox was a single-player product with no regulatory complexity. A legal referral marketplace is categorically harder to build alone. You need someone who can sell to PI attorneys (a notoriously relationship-driven buyer), someone who understands legal ethics rules across jurisdictions, and someone building the voice AI infrastructure. That's at minimum three distinct competencies. One person, no matter how talented, creates a bottleneck that limits the company's clock speed. The active job posting for a software engineer suggests awareness of this, but a hire isn't a co-founder.

The bull case I have to take seriously: this founder is so abnormally resourceful that the normal rules may not apply. Two exits before turning 15 is not a normal biography. The legal referral market is genuinely massive ($5-6.5B in implied referral fees for PI alone), genuinely broken, and genuinely protected by regulatory schlep that deters competitors. If Iqbol can learn the legal domain as fast as his track record suggests he learns everything else, and if he can recruit a co-founder or senior legal operator quickly, the "become a law firm" strategy could create something structurally unique. Voice AI technology reaching production quality right now creates a real timing window. This is a case where I'd want to talk to the founder directly -- the missing variable is whether there's an organic backstory the public record doesn't capture, and whether the determination I see in the biography translates to the specific resourcefulness required to navigate PI law firm sales and state bar compliance.

But based on what I can see, this falls into a pattern I've watched play out many times: a brilliant technical founder who picks a large market rather than solving a problem they can't stop thinking about. The technology layer -- VAPI, Twilio, LLMs, vector databases -- is entirely commodity. Smith.ai already does AI receptionist services for law firms. Any well-resourced legal tech incumbent could bolt on voice intake. The defensibility has to come from network density and the law-firm-licensing strategy, but neither exists yet, and building both requires domain expertise this founder hasn't demonstrated. I'd watch this founder closely for what he does next -- the underlying talent is exceptional -- but for this specific company, at this specific stage, the gap between the founder's experience and the problem's demands is too wide for my framework.
