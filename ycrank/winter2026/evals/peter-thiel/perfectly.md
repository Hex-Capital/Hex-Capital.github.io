# Perfectly -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

Over one hundred AI recruiting startups emerged in 2024 and 2025. One hundred. This is not a market being born — it is a market being destroyed before it exists. When I see a hundred companies converging on the same thesis at the same time, I see the purest expression of mimetic rivalry: founders imitating each other into a competitive equilibrium where no one earns returns. Alex raised $20 million. Perfect raised $23 million. Dover, Tezi, Hireflow, and dozens of others are all building variants of the same proposition — use AI to automate some or all of the recruiting pipeline. The thesis that "AI can replace human recruiters" is not a secret. It is the most obvious application of large language models that anyone in Silicon Valley could name. When I ask my signature question — "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" — the answer from Perfectly would need to be something that the other ninety-nine startups have missed. I see no evidence of such an insight. The differentiation described here is operational (full-cycle vs. partial-cycle, commission vs. SaaS), not conceptual. Tactical variation within a consensus thesis is not a secret — it is a positioning choice in a crowded market.

The founders bring genuine technical credentials. ML Scientist at TikTok, Senior MLE at Meta, a NeurIPS publication on vision-language reasoning — this is not a team of consultants in suits. Their experience with recommendation systems at scale maps directly to candidate-job matching, and their 800+ agency-sourced interviews at TikTok provide authentic domain pain. I take founder-market fit seriously, and on the technical dimension, this team is credible. But credibility is not conviction. I see no evidence of a definite vision — no articulation of what the world looks like in ten years if Perfectly succeeds, no refusal of easier paths, no signal that these founders hold a thesis so strongly they would endure years of pain rather than pivot. The YC Launch page describes standard automation benefits: faster, cheaper, more volume. This is the language of incremental improvement, not the language of someone designing the future.

The commission-based agency model is worth examining because it reveals the structural problem. A contingency recruiter — human or AI — gets paid when a role is filled and then has no ongoing relationship with the client. There are no switching costs. The hiring manager can use Perfectly for one role and a competitor for the next without friction. Contrast this with Palantir, where every month of government deployment deepens the integration, increases the switching costs, and widens the moat. Perfectly's business model actively prevents the accumulation of structural advantage. The described "data flywheel" — learning from hiring preferences and reusable candidate screens — is theoretically sound, but every AI recruiting company describes an identical flywheel. Data advantages require exclusivity, and nothing in this model prevents candidates from completing AI screens on multiple platforms or hiring managers from describing the same preferences to competing tools.

The strongest bull case for Perfectly is disruption of the incumbents. Robert Half, Hays, and Randstad are structurally unable to replace their human recruiter workforce with AI — doing so would cannibalize their core revenue model. This creates a genuine window where an AI-first entrant could undercut the entire $32 billion contingency recruiting market on price while matching or exceeding quality. If Perfectly's matching algorithm genuinely produces candidates who pass interviews at 2x the rate of traditional agencies — and if this advantage compounds as the system ingests more data — then the unit economics become devastating for incumbents: near-zero marginal cost per placement versus $15,000-$30,000 in recruiter labor. The problem is that this structural advantage against incumbents does not translate into a structural advantage against the other hundred AI-native startups. The incumbent disruption thesis is shared by everyone in the space. The question is not whether AI will disrupt recruiting agencies — it obviously will — but whether Perfectly specifically will capture monopoly value from that disruption. Nothing in the evidence suggests it will.

The technology itself, while competently applied, does not represent a discontinuity. LLM-based outreach, automated screening interviews, and algorithmic candidate matching are all built on foundation models that every competitor has equal access to. The founders' recommendation systems expertise from TikTok and Meta is relevant but not proprietary — Meta and TikTok employ thousands of ML engineers with similar backgrounds. A NeurIPS paper on vision-language reasoning is impressive but orthogonal to the core matching problem. I look for technology that makes a previously impossible thing possible. AI recruiting makes human recruiting cheaper and faster — a quantitative improvement, not a qualitative leap. This is 1-to-n work dressed in AI branding.

I pass. The market is a Girardian catastrophe in formation — a hundred companies competing on the same consensus thesis with commoditized technology and no path to monopoly. Competent founders solving a real problem, but solving it in a way that a dozen other competent teams are also solving. The absence of a genuine secret, combined with a business model that structurally prevents moat formation, makes this precisely the kind of investment I avoid.
