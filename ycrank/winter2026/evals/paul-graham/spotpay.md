# SpotPay -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The problem Zsika Phillip grew up with is real. Moving money between the US and the Caribbean is slow, expensive, and degrading. I believe him when he says he experienced it firsthand. That's organic. The question I keep returning to, though, is whether this problem is still hiding. In 2010, online payment processing was obviously broken but nobody was doing anything about it -- that was schlep blindness, and it's why Stripe had the field nearly to itself. Cross-border stablecoin payments in 2026 is the opposite of that. Kontigo has $30 million in annualized revenue and a million users. Plasma has $74 million in funding and Peter Thiel on speed dial. Slash has raised $41 million. And Pana -- in the same YC batch -- is targeting the same corridors with a founder who was literally Head of Digital Banking at Scotiabank Caribbean. This is a hot, crowded category where the idea is consensus. Everyone sees the schlep. That's the core issue.

The organic origin story passes my first test. Zsika grew up between the Caribbean and Latin America. He didn't read a market report about remittances; he lived the friction. That matters. But organic discovery only gives you a structural advantage when it leads you to a problem others can't see. When the problem is visible to dozens of well-funded teams, personal experience becomes necessary but not sufficient. Stripe didn't just have founders who understood the pain -- they had a multi-year head start because the banking and regulatory work scared everyone else off. SpotPay is entering a market where competitors have already done that work and have real scale.

The technical team is the strongest thing here. Thomas César-Herriau was engineer number four at Brex. He built financial infrastructure at scale, managed observability teams, and has 21 public repos on GitHub. Zsika has a CS master's from Purdue and was a lead engineer at Google before becoming a PM. Two technical founders who shipped a working app with a card product, Apple Pay integration, and FinCEN registration -- all with two people. That's impressive capital efficiency and it demonstrates genuine building ability. If I were evaluating the team in isolation, I'd be interested.

But the traction is essentially zero. Nine ratings on the App Store. No public user count, no revenue signal, no press, no Product Hunt launch, no community. At pre-seed I don't demand traction, but I do want to see some sign that real humans are pulling the product toward them. When Airbnb's founders went to New York, they discovered hosts who needed those rentals to pay their rent -- economic dependency that couldn't be faked. SpotPay has a referral program and Spanish language support, which suggests they're thinking about distribution to diaspora communities, but thinking about it and having users who'd be devastated if the product disappeared are very different things.

The strongest bull case: Caribbean corridors are specifically underserved compared to the broader LatAm market that bigger competitors target. Kontigo and Plasma are going wide across emerging markets; SpotPay could own a narrow corridor the way Facebook owned Harvard before expanding. The CTO's Brex pedigree means the infrastructure will be built right. And the stablecoin timing is genuinely favorable -- YC itself is offering stablecoin funding starting Spring 2026. If SpotPay can build deep liquidity and trust in Caribbean diaspora communities before the larger players focus there, the corridor-specific network effects could create real defensibility. That's a legitimate path. It would require the founders to be on the ground in those communities the way Airbnb was on the ground in New York -- doing things that don't scale, building trust person by person. I see no evidence yet that this is happening, but it's early enough that it could.

What I keep coming back to is that Zsika's first startup was in mobile game monetization -- a completely different domain. SpotPay is his second company. There's nothing wrong with pivoting, and the personal connection to cross-border payments is genuine. But I notice a difference between founders who pivot toward their organic pain and founders who have been building in a domain for years because they can't stop thinking about it. The CTO's Brex background provides deep fintech credibility; the CEO's path is more circuitous. Combined with a market where competitors have raised over $135 million collectively and one has already hit $30 million ARR, this feels like a company that has found a real problem but arrived at a crowded table.
