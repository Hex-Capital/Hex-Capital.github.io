# Caretta -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the competitive landscape, and it tells me everything about where this bet sits on the consensus spectrum. Gong has raised $584M and generates $250M+ in ARR. Cresta has raised $282M. Balto, Salesken, Oliv AI — all funded, all moving toward the same convergence point. "AI for sales calls" is not a contrarian position in 2026. It's a PowerPoint slide in every pitch deck at every demo day. When the technical enablement layer — low-latency LLMs, commodity speech-to-text via NVIDIA Parakeet — becomes available to everyone simultaneously, the "why now" argument cuts both ways. Yes, real-time call intelligence is newly feasible. But it's newly feasible for Gong's 800-person engineering team too. The timing is correct but shared. You don't get paid for being right at the same time as everyone else.

The specific knowledge gap here is the core issue. Three TU Delft computer science graduates whose prior work includes Discord bots scaled to 30,000 users and a Chrome extension. No evidence of time spent in B2B sales, no years grinding through enterprise deal cycles, no lived understanding of why reps fumble objections or how sales managers actually adopt new tools. They pivoted from VoysAI — recruitment screening and call practice — to live-call intelligence within six months of their first launch. That's not the arc of founders who've been obsessing over a problem for years. That's the arc of technically skilled builders searching for a market. The distinction matters: when I backed the Notion team, Ivan Zhao had been thinking about the relationship between tools and thought for years before writing a line of code. The insight preceded the product. Here, the capability preceded the insight. They can build real-time AI systems — but what do they know about selling to VP Sales that a smart engineer with access to the same APIs wouldn't also know in three months?

The leverage architecture is weaker than it appears. Yes, it's software, so there's baseline code leverage. But Caretta makes existing salespeople incrementally better at their existing jobs. Compare this to Replit, which enables an entirely new population to write software — that's leverage creation, a qualitative expansion of who can produce output. Or compare to Stack Overflow, where every developer's question improved the system for every other developer — cross-customer compounding. Caretta's knowledge base compounds within each customer silo. That's a switching cost, and switching costs are real, but they're not the same as network effects or platform leverage. Each new customer doesn't make the product better for existing customers. You're building a series of independent knowledge graphs, not a network. The Slack integration is smart as a distribution wedge, but it doesn't change the fundamental leverage ratio.

The bull case I'd want to stress-test: real-time in-call is architecturally different enough from post-call analytics that incumbents will be structurally slow to ship it — the way mobile-first companies outran desktop incumbents. If Gong's entire business logic, pricing model, and customer messaging is organized around recordings and post-call analytics, bolting on real-time could cannibalize their core narrative. In that world, Caretta's speed and focus could matter. The founders are clearly capable builders — getting into YC, raising $1.3M, and pivoting quickly shows energy and adaptability. And if the per-customer knowledge flywheel genuinely creates data that gets better with every call, a two-year head start in accumulating organizational intelligence could mean something. But this bull case requires that (a) Gong moves slowly, (b) the founders develop sales domain expertise fast enough to build the right product, and (c) the knowledge accumulation creates switching costs strong enough to survive when a well-funded competitor offers similar features bundled with an established analytics suite. I'd need to see at least one of those validated before writing a check.

The technology on display — a public GitHub repo wrapping NVIDIA's Parakeet model in a FastAPI service, zero stars — is not difficult technology compounding over time. It's commodity infrastructure assembled competently. That's table stakes, not a moat. When the core technical components are available off-the-shelf, defensibility has to come from somewhere else: proprietary data, network effects, distribution, or deep domain knowledge that shapes the product in ways competitors can't easily copy. I don't see evidence of any of those yet. Smart founders building a feature that a well-resourced incumbent could ship as a quarterly product update — that's a race I don't want to bet on with my own money.
