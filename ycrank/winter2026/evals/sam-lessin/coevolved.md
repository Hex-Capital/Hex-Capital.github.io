# Coevolved -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is an AI company where AI is the entire product. Strip away the LLM-powered document extraction, the agentic orchestration, the automated verification -- and there is no business left. No physical operations, no proprietary data asset, no regulatory position, no protocol that others build on. Just software automating a workflow. I have spent the last two years arguing publicly that this is the single worst structural position a startup can occupy in 2026, and Coevolved is a near-perfect specimen of the pattern. The core capabilities -- document OCR, data extraction, form auto-fill, anomaly detection -- are individually available from horizontal platforms like Ocrolus today. Blend has $685 million in funding, an existing install base, and every incentive to bolt AI onto its workflow. The dossier itself concedes that "a well-funded fintech or mortgage technology company could assemble similar capabilities." That's not a risk factor -- that's the whole story.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't clear my first filter. Athan Zhang and Alex Li are clearly sharp -- Princeton CS with NLP research under Danqi Chen, Five Rings quant internship, UW CS with distributed systems experience at Trade Desk. Athan raised $1.2 million for a medtech startup in college, which demonstrates hustle and ability to ship. These are capable technical founders. But the "sane" in my framework has to be domain-specific credibility for the particular idea, and neither founder has any documented experience in mortgage lending, loan origination, or financial services compliance. Mortgage is one of the most heavily regulated industries in America -- TRID rules, state-by-state licensing, ECOA, CFPB oversight. A Princeton CS grad with an NLP background approaching this from the outside is not the same signal as, say, a former head of loan ops at a mid-size lender who also happens to be a strong engineer. And the idea itself -- AI agents for mortgage automation -- is thoroughly consensus. Every fintech investor on Sand Hill Road has this on their "obvious AI applications" list. When the idea is obvious, the returns are already priced in.

The pivot trajectory concerns me structurally. The company maintained an open-source multi-agent framework through January 2026, archived it, and pivoted to vertical mortgage AI. This is a solution searching for a problem. Contrast this with how my best investments work: the Teamshares founders spent years understanding small business transitions before building technology to enable employee ownership. The Craftwork founders ran painting operations before layering software on top. Domain obsession precedes product. Here, the sequence is reversed -- build a general agent framework, then go looking for a vertical that might work. The mortgage industry has a way of punishing outsiders who underestimate its complexity.

The strongest bull case is real but insufficient. Mortgage origination costs over $10,000 per loan. The incumbents' architectures were built pre-LLM and carry genuine technical debt. There is a window where a clean-sheet agentic system could outperform legacy workflow tools, and if Coevolved can accumulate proprietary mortgage document data across enough lenders, a data flywheel could theoretically develop. The regulatory complexity that makes this hard for outsiders also makes it hard for horizontal AI platforms to just drop in. And the "why now" is legitimate -- LLM capabilities crossed a reliability threshold, and lender cost pressure is acute. If the founders develop deep mortgage domain expertise fast, hire a compliance-savvy operator, and land a few mid-size independent lenders as early design partners, this could work. But I'd need to see evidence that the founders are building toward operational depth in mortgage specifically -- not just applying their agent framework to a vertical they identified through market sizing exercises.

My framework produces a clear verdict here. Would this business exist without AI? No. Does AI make an existing moat deeper? There is no existing moat. Is this a new primitive that others build on? No -- it's an application on top of LLM APIs and mortgage rails. Can the narrative expand to infinity? Mortgage origination automation has a visible ceiling. Is there real revenue providing a downside cushion? No evidence of any current-product traction. This is five for five on the wrong side of my criteria. The founders have technical talent that I'd be interested in seeing applied to a structurally different problem -- something with physical-world complexity where software is the cherry on top, not the sundae.
