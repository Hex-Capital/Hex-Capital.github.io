# Carson -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Carson's tagline tells you everything you need to know about where this idea came from: "more capable than Cowork, more secure than OpenClaw." That's not a problem statement. That's a positioning statement. When your company's identity is defined by two competitors rather than by a user's pain, you've built a product from market analysis, not from lived experience. I keep asking myself: if OpenClaw hadn't gone viral in November 2025 and Cowork hadn't shipped a prompt-injection bug in January 2026, would Carson exist? I don't think it would. The idea is reactive to headlines, and reactive ideas have a specific failure mode -- they solve the problem as it was described in TechCrunch rather than as it actually exists inside organizations.

The schlep test here is inverted in a way that concerns me. Schlep blindness is about problems everyone unconsciously avoids because the work is ugly and tedious. Enterprise AI agent security is the opposite -- it's the problem everyone is consciously talking about right now. CrowdStrike released detection tools. Gartner published advisories. Every CISO in America is writing memos about it. When the problem is this visible, you don't get the structural competition advantage that schlep blindness provides. Stripe worked because for a decade nobody wanted to deal with banks and PCI compliance. Carson is entering a space where Runlayer already has $11M and eight unicorn customers, Anthropic announced enterprise features for Cowork on February 24, 2026, and Microsoft Copilot ships enterprise-grade agent capabilities at $30/seat. A four-person startup whose core differentiator is "security plus adaptive UIs" is describing a feature set that any of these incumbents could build in a quarter.

The strongest bull case is that Carson's approach -- generating task-specific interfaces dynamically rather than wrapping existing agents or providing a monolithic chat interface -- is genuinely architecturally distinct, and that the founding team's security credentials (Palantir secure deployment, Robust Intelligence AI red-teaming) give them authentic insight into what enterprise security actually requires versus what blog posts say it requires. If you squint, you can see a version of this where Carson becomes the Stripe of AI agent security: everyone knows the problem, multiple companies have tried, but Carson builds the right developer experience with the right security primitives and wins through product quality. Milan Bhandari built Bolto through YC S23 and raised $5M, so there's real startup execution experience on the team. For this to work, though, they'd need to ship something genuinely differentiated before Anthropic closes the enterprise gap -- and Anthropic moves fast.

What bothers me about Milan's trajectory is the departure from Bolto. He co-founded an AI-powered HR/payroll platform, raised over $5M, and left while the company was still active to start Carson. I've seen founders pivot to better opportunities, and sometimes that's the right call. But it's also a pattern that can indicate restlessness rather than determination. The best founders I've backed -- the ones who sold cereal boxes to keep their companies alive -- stayed with their problems through years of pain. Leaving a funded company after two years to chase the hottest new category is not the same signal.

The team is technically strong -- four CS graduates from Harvard and Stanford, all with relevant engineering backgrounds, all capable of building the product themselves. That matters. It's the one dimension where Carson clearly passes my bar. But technical competence without organic problem discovery produces a specific failure mode I wrote about years ago: brilliant people building something that sounds smart on paper but doesn't emerge from genuine need. The founding team could build almost anything. The question is whether this particular thing is what they'd build if they weren't trying to start a startup -- and the timing and positioning suggest the answer is no.

At pre-launch with no users, no revenue, and no public prototype, there's nothing to evaluate on the demand side. The market clearly wants secure AI agents -- that's evident from enterprise bans of OpenClaw and the rapid growth of Runlayer's customer base. But market demand for a category is different from user pull for a specific product, and Carson hasn't yet demonstrated that its particular approach (adaptive task-specific interfaces) is what enterprises actually want versus what sounds good on a waitlist page.
