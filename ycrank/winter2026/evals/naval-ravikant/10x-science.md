# 10x Science -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The specific knowledge on this founding team is unusually deep -- not "spent two years at a biotech company" deep, but "50+ publications in Nature and JACS, two US patents, trained under a Nobel laureate in the exact analytical technique the company targets" deep. David Roberts didn't study protein characterization in a classroom. He developed new methods for top-down mass spectrometry and glycoproteomics at the bench, in Carolyn Bertozzi's lab at Stanford, for years. Andrew Reiter built proteomics workflows at the Broad Institute's platform under Steven Carr -- one of a handful of facilities globally where this work happens at the frontier. This is knowledge that lives in the hands, not the head. A competitor can't hire their way to this understanding. It takes years of instrument time, failed experiments, and accumulated intuition about fragmentation patterns and spectral interpretation. When I backed Stack Overflow, the signal was that the founders were developers who had lived inside the developer knowledge problem. Here, the founders have lived inside the protein characterization problem at its most advanced edge. That bar is met.

The leverage architecture is real but bounded. What they're building is code leverage applied to a process that currently requires weeks of manual expert analysis per drug candidate. If AI can compress that workflow from weeks to hours, one analytical scientist with 10x Science produces the output of a team. That's meaningful -- it mirrors how Notion gave one knowledge worker the output of five. But the delivery mechanism is enterprise SaaS sold to biopharma analytical development teams. Enterprise biopharma sales cycles are long, require regulatory validation, and demand customization. The leverage ratio of "one engineering team serving millions of individual users" doesn't apply here. It's closer to "one engineering team serving hundreds of enterprise accounts, each requiring onboarding, compliance documentation, and instrument-specific configuration." The instrument-agnostic positioning is strategically correct -- it attacks the structural conflict where Thermo Fisher and Waters are incentivized to maintain hardware lock-in rather than build the best possible software. That's a real opening. But the leverage ceiling is set by the enterprise sales motion, not by the technology.

The contrarian timing angle is more interesting than it appears at first glance. "AI for biotech" is consensus -- every fund is writing checks there. But nearly all that capital is flowing to the front end: generative protein design, molecule screening, structure prediction. The characterization bottleneck -- the analytical quality work that happens *after* AI designs a drug candidate -- is being ignored. It's the un-sexy middle of the pipeline. AI-designed proteins are flooding the development stage, and the existing tools (BioPharma Finder, UNIFI, Byonic) were built for a world where you characterized ten candidates a year, not a thousand. Building for the characterization throughput crisis is a genuinely non-consensus bet. Smart biotech investors are saying "the value is in discovery." 10x Science is saying the value has shifted downstream, to the analytical infrastructure that validates what the discovery tools produce. That's the kind of structural observation that comes from specific knowledge, not from reading TechCrunch.

The integrity dimension has one yellow flag worth noting. The YC page claims a "2x YC Founder" on the team, but public records show Vishnu Tejus listed as "Founding Software Engineer" at Nooks, not co-founder. This could be a loose use of terminology, or there's a prior YC affiliation that isn't publicly traceable. Either way, it's the kind of small credential inflation I watch for -- not disqualifying, but noted. The broader team composition is well-structured: two deep domain scientists paired with a technical builder who has shipped and scaled a product through a $43M Series B. Tejus provides the engineering velocity and startup pattern recognition that the scientists lack. The co-founder relationship is organic -- Roberts and Reiter worked together in the same lab -- not assembled through a co-founder matching service.

The bull case for compounding defensibility is strong in theory. As the platform processes more biopharma characterization data, the AI models should improve -- a data flywheel where accuracy compounds with usage. If 10x Science becomes embedded in customers' regulatory submission workflows, switching costs become formidable. No biopharma company wants to re-validate its analytical methods mid-program. The combination of domain expertise moat, regulatory switching costs, and AI data compounding could create the kind of defensibility that makes this a decade-long bet. The bear case is that Dotmatics, with 200+ biopharma customers already using Byonic/Byos, bolts on AI features and leverages its existing relationships and regulatory track record to block adoption. That's a credible threat, but it's also the argument that gets made against every startup attacking an incumbent -- and it's usually wrong, because incumbents are optimizing for their current architecture, not for what the technology makes possible. The regulatory validation timeline is the real constraint. This company needs an early customer partnership with a regulatory-stage program to prove the platform in a GxP environment. Without that, the sales cycle stalls at the pilot stage indefinitely.

I'd take this bet. The specific knowledge is genuine, the leverage is real if bounded, and the timing insight -- that the bottleneck has shifted from discovery to characterization -- is the kind of structural observation that only comes from people who have lived inside the problem. The outcome ceiling is lower than a platform play like Replit or Notion because the market is specialized, but the founder-problem fit is among the strongest I've seen in a YC batch. At pre-seed pricing, the asymmetry is favorable.
