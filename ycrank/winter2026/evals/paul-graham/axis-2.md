# Axis -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I look for is how the founders found the problem. Axis is building AI models for monitoring commodities markets -- prices, flows, refinery data, geopolitical signals. When I read that the founders share a thesis that "models would enable a new paradigm for how we interact with markets," I hear the language of an idea conceived in a dorm room, not discovered in the trenches. Eric Zhu interned at TransMarket Group doing quant trading. Ian Wang is described as "interested in trading." An internship and an interest are not the same as spending three years at a physical trading desk stitching together Argus feeds, Kpler dashboards, and internal spreadsheets at 4am before a crude shipment decision. The difference matters enormously. When Drew Houston forgot his USB drive, that was organic pain. When the Collisons tried to accept a payment online, that was organic pain. "We think models could transform markets" is a hypothesis, not a frustration. And hypotheses are much easier to abandon when the work gets hard.

The schlep here is real and genuinely enormous -- I want to be clear about that. Sourcing proprietary commodity data from incumbents like Argus Media and S&P Global Platts, who have no incentive to make their feeds easily accessible to a startup. Selling to physical commodities trading desks at firms like Vitol and Trafigura, where procurement cycles are measured in quarters and trust is measured in years. Navigating the technical complexity of integrating structured price data with unstructured geopolitical intelligence in real time. This is exactly the kind of ugly, multi-dimensional schlep that causes most founders to unconsciously look away. And that's what makes this space potentially interesting. But schlep blindness only works as a moat when the founders who see the problem actually have the domain depth to navigate the pain. An internship at TransMarket is one data point. It's not enough to convince me these founders know what they're walking into.

The strongest thing in this dossier is that Wang and Zhu have known each other since pre-school. That's the kind of co-founder relationship I care about -- deep enough to survive the stress of a startup without fracturing. In one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they barely knew and all nine imploded. The friendship here is genuine and tested by time. But a strong co-founder bond is a necessary condition for success, not a sufficient one. It means they won't fall apart under pressure. It doesn't mean they'll build something people want.

What would have to be true for this to be a great investment? The bull case goes like this: commodities analytics is dominated by legacy providers locked into benchmark-reporting business models that structurally prevent them from offering customizable AI deployment. Kpler and Vortexa have data pipelines but are vertically integrated around specific modalities -- vessel tracking, waterborne energy. Nobody has built the horizontal model-deployment layer that lets a trader configure custom monitoring across all data types. If Zhu's quant background gives him enough intuition about what traders actually need, and if the LLM cost curve continues collapsing to make real-time multi-source monitoring economically viable at startup scale, and if they can land even one trading desk early through YC connections -- then the schlep itself becomes their moat because nobody else wants to build the integrations. That's a plausible story. But it requires me to assume domain depth I can't observe, technical ability I can't verify (no GitHub, no prototype, a website that's just a page title), and user pull that doesn't exist yet. That's too many assumptions stacked on top of each other.

The competitive landscape compounds my concern. Kpler has $441 million in funding and $100 million in ARR. They've made three acquisitions in the last two years, which tells you they're actively buying capabilities in adjacent spaces. Vortexa just raised $34 million and is near profitability. These aren't sleeping incumbents -- they're well-capitalized, technically sophisticated platforms with existing customer relationships at the exact trading desks Axis needs to reach. A pre-seed startup with no visible product going against this field needs either extraordinary domain advantage or extraordinary technical capability. I see evidence of neither. What I see is two smart recent graduates who noticed a real problem in a space they've been adjacent to, but who haven't yet demonstrated the kind of hands-on, build-it-yourself intensity that distinguishes founders who make things from founders who plan to make things.
