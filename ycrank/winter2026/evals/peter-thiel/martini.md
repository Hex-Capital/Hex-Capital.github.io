# Martini -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing fact in this dossier is not about Martini -- it is about Martini's suppliers. Runway has raised $860 million and is targeting $300 million in annualized revenue. Luma AI has raised over a billion. These are not merely competitors operating in an adjacent space. They are the companies whose models Martini routes requests to. Martini's entire product depends on API access to platforms that have every incentive to build the workflow features Martini provides and every capability to restrict the API access Martini requires. When your suppliers are your competitors, and they have a thousand times your capital, you do not have a secret -- you have a dependency.

The implicit thesis here is a "picks and shovels" argument: as AI video models proliferate and commoditize, the value accrues not to any single model but to the orchestration layer that gives professionals control over all of them. This is plausible economics but it is not a secret. Every sophisticated observer of the AI stack has articulated some version of "the infrastructure layer will commoditize and value will shift to the application layer." When your thesis can be found in any Sequoia market map presentation, it is convention, not insight. More fundamentally, the picks-and-shovels thesis contains a structural contradiction in this case: if models truly commoditize, the orchestration layer's margins compress because its pass-through costs converge toward zero and anyone can build a routing interface. If models do not commoditize and one model wins decisively -- which the power law predicts -- then model-agnostic routing loses its raison d'etre. Martini is betting against the power law in AI video generation, which strikes me as betting against the most consistent pattern in technology markets.

The Figma analogy -- "Figma but for generative film" -- is instructive, but not in the way the founders intend. Figma succeeded because it built genuinely proprietary browser-based rendering technology that was an order of magnitude faster than anything else, created network effects through real-time multiplayer collaboration that compounded with every designer who joined, and faced incumbents (Sketch, Adobe XD) that were structurally trapped in desktop architectures and could not respond without cannibalizing their existing products. Martini has none of these structural advantages. The cinematography controls are UX design, not proprietary technology -- a competent product team at Runway or Adobe could replicate camera position, lens selection, and movement controls within a quarter. The collaboration features are standard SaaS multiplayer, not a network effect that compounds. And the incumbents here are not legacy desktop companies paralyzed by the innovator's dilemma -- they are AI-native startups that ship weekly and an Adobe that has already invested in Runway's Series E, signaling its intention to integrate generative AI directly into Premiere Pro. The Figma analogy highlights precisely what Martini lacks.

I want to engage seriously with the bull case, because the founder-market fit is genuine and rare. Koh Terai is an actual cinematographer with Cannes screening credits who studied design at Stanford -- not a consultant who read about filmmaking in a market research report. The insight that professional filmmakers need cinematographic controls rather than chat-style prompting reflects lived experience, and the 200 films produced on the platform suggest real users solving real problems. If Martini could establish itself as the default collaborative workspace for professional AI-assisted filmmaking before the model companies build their own workflow layers, the switching costs from accumulated project data, team configurations, and learned workflows could create meaningful lock-in. The business model conflict argument has teeth -- Runway cannot easily become model-agnostic without undermining its core model revenue, just as Microsoft could not easily embrace Linux without threatening Windows. For this investment to work, Martini would need to acquire professional users at a pace that makes it the standard workflow tool before Runway, Luma, or Adobe build equivalent features. Given the capital asymmetry -- Runway alone has raised nearly a thousand times more than Martini -- this is a race the two-person team is structurally unlikely to win.

The category itself troubles me. Generative AI video production is not a sector where the underlying technology is stagnant -- quite the opposite. It is a sector experiencing violent, capital-intensive innovation where model capabilities double every few months and the landscape reshuffles with each new model release. But the innovation is happening at the model layer, not at the workflow layer. Martini is building a stable interface on top of an unstable foundation, which means the product must be rebuilt or adjusted every time a new model with different capabilities and APIs arrives. This is the treadmill problem: the company must continuously integrate new models just to maintain feature parity with the experience each model provider offers natively. That is not a monopoly -- it is a maintenance burden.

The absence of any proprietary technology -- no trained models, no novel algorithms, no data flywheel -- means this company cannot achieve 10x superiority on any dimension that compounds over time. A better UI is valuable but it is not defensible in the way that SpaceX's reusable rocket technology is defensible, where each launch generates data that makes the next launch cheaper and more reliable. Martini's UX advantage is static -- it can be replicated without access to any proprietary asset. The company occupies the most dangerous position in the technology stack: a thin layer between commodity inputs and commodity outputs, with value capture dependent entirely on the pace of feature adoption by users before better-capitalized players absorb the functionality.
