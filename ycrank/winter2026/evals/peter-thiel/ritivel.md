# Ritivel -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the entire story before I even reach the founders. Yseop has powered 150+ clinical trials and won TIME's Best Inventions recognition. Certara, a public company, launched CoAuthor over two years ago. Deep Intelligent Pharma has raised north of $110 million. McKinsey co-developed a CSR writing platform with Merck that cut first-draft time from 180 hours to 80. And now a three-person pre-seed team walks in with the same thesis -- AI can automate regulatory document writing -- that every one of these players has already been executing on for years. This is the mimetic convergence I warn about most urgently. When the global consulting firms, public companies, and nine-figure-funded startups are all pursuing identical strategies, there is no secret to be found. There is only a crowded field of imitators racing toward margin compression.

What is the secret? I keep looking for one and I cannot find it. "Pharma regulatory writing is slow and expensive, and LLMs can generate first drafts" is not a non-obvious truth -- it is a McKinsey slide deck. It is consensus dressed in Y Combinator clothing. The local deployment and zero-data-retention architecture is a sensible product decision for a security-conscious customer base, but it is an implementation choice, not a secret about the world. Any competitor can offer local deployment. The word-level citation traceability is a useful feature, not a 10x technological discontinuity. The Veeva and SharePoint integrations reduce adoption friction, but integration depth is earned over years of enterprise deployment -- and incumbents like Certara already have those relationships. I see nothing here that most intelligent pharma technology observers would disagree with. Everyone sees this opportunity. When everyone sees it, no one captures monopoly profits.

The founding team has genuine technical credentials -- Pavan Kalyan's NeurIPS publication on text-to-SQL and his SIGMOD workshop papers demonstrate real research capability in AI-meets-structured-data problems. That is the right intellectual background for this kind of work. But technical capability without domain immersion is insufficient. None of these founders has worked inside pharma regulatory affairs. They have not sat through 18-month submission cycles, managed CTD Module 2.7 clinical summaries, or navigated an FDA Type A pre-submission meeting. They observed the problem through "50+ conversations with pharma professionals" -- discovery interviews, not lived experience. And the partially unverified claim that the founders "previously built AI copilots at Microsoft Research" introduces an integrity question that, while not damning, makes me more cautious. The consulting pedigree from Kearney on one co-founder fits the pattern I have seen fail in deep-tech sectors -- strategy orientation where engineering obsession is required.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the incumbents are structurally unable to build an AI-native product. Yseop's older NLG technology might be architecturally disadvantaged versus transformer-based approaches. Certara might treat CoAuthor as a minor feature within a biosimulation empire rather than a standalone product worth winning. Deep Intelligent Pharma's broader clinical trials focus might leave a wedge for a pure-play regulatory writing tool. And if Ritivel could establish itself as the default writing layer within Veeva's ecosystem -- essentially becoming infrastructure rather than a standalone product -- the switching costs could compound meaningfully over time. The $45 million monthly cost of drug delays is a real pain point that justifies significant spend. If these founders could achieve what Stripe achieved in payments -- becoming the invisible layer that developers (in this case, regulatory writers) refuse to give up -- there would be a genuine monopoly. But that path requires surviving long enough in an enterprise sales environment with 6-18 month cycles while better-funded competitors with existing pharma relationships close deals today. At pre-seed, with no customers, no pilots, and no named LOIs, the probability of navigating that gauntlet is low.

The fundamental problem is structural, not executional. This market has the characteristics I avoid most consistently: multiple funded players pursuing identical theses, technology built on commodity foundation models, and a consensus narrative about AI transforming regulated document workflows. The pharma regulatory affairs market is real and large, but "large market, obvious problem, many competitors" is precisely the configuration that produces zero monopoly profits. Going from zero to one means creating something genuinely new. Ritivel is going from one to n -- building a slightly different version of what Yseop, Certara, and DIP already offer. That is competition, and competition remains what it has always been.
