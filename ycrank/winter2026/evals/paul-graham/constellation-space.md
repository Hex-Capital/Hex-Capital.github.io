# Constellation Space -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Kamran Majid built the anomaly detection system for SpaceX's Starlink ground network. He literally did this job -- ingesting satellite telemetry, optimizing ground station routing, flagging degradation -- inside the world's largest constellation operator. Then he left to build a company that does the same thing as a product for everyone else. That's the kind of organic discovery that makes me pay attention. He didn't read a market report about satellite growth and brainstorm startup ideas. He was the person sitting at the console, watching link failures happen in real time, and thinking "this should be automated." When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer here is unambiguous: Kamran was living inside it.

The schlep is real but it's a specific kind of schlep. Combining ITU atmospheric propagation models with orbital mechanics with ML with federated learning with defense-grade security requirements -- this is ugly, multi-layered engineering that most AI teams would unconsciously avoid. An ML startup wants clean data and fast iteration cycles. Satellite telemetry gives you noisy, sparse data from systems moving at 7 km/s in environments where you can't just re-run the experiment. The founders acknowledged in their Launch HN that labeled data for rare edge cases remains insufficient. That honesty is good -- but it also reveals the depth of the technical schlep. The important distinction though: this isn't Stripe-style schlep blindness where thousands of hackers knew payments were broken and looked away. Satellite link management isn't hiding in plain sight. It's hiding in a specialized niche that most people have never encountered. The problem is genuine, but the "everyone knows about it and nobody wants to touch it" dynamic that creates structural competition barriers isn't as strong here.

The team composition tells an interesting story. Four founders, all sharing Capital One as a prior employer -- that's where the relationships formed, which is good. Co-founders who met at work and have seen each other operate under pressure are far better than strangers who matched on a co-founder dating app. But Capital One is fintech, not space. Only Kamran (SpaceX, NASA) and Raaid (Blue Origin New Glenn) have genuine aerospace domain experience. Laith and Omeed bring ML/systems chops from UT Austin and Capital One's AI infrastructure. That's useful -- you need people who can build the ML pipeline. But in a domain this specialized, I'd feel better if three of four had satellite dirt under their fingernails instead of two. The technical capability is clearly there: they've built a platform processing 100K messages per second with physics-informed neural networks. These are hackers who build things themselves, not MBAs assembling slide decks. Omeed's personal projects -- a Starlink simulator, multi-GPU programming APIs, deep RL implementations -- show someone who makes things because they want to, not because a manager assigned tickets.

Here's what concerns me most, and it's structural: the addressable customer base is terrifyingly narrow. How many satellite constellation operators exist? SpaceX, Amazon Kuiper, OneWeb, Telesat, SES, a handful of government programs, and maybe ten others. That's it. And the two largest -- SpaceX and Amazon -- will absolutely build this capability internally. Kamran already helped build the SpaceX version. So you're selling to everyone except the market leaders, with 12-24 month aerospace sales cycles, as a pre-seed startup competing against Aalyria (Google spinout with government contracts), Cognitive Space ($11.2M raised, existing DARPA and Space Force customers), and Quindar ($27M raised, YC S22). The "design partner phase with defense and commercial operators" is the only traction signal, and without named partners, I can't distinguish "actively testing our platform" from "took a meeting." The Launch HN post got 48 upvotes and 18 comments, which is modest signal -- enough to show the technical community found it interesting, not enough to show operators are pulling the product toward them.

The bull case, and it's a real one: the satellite constellation market is expanding dramatically. Blue Origin announced 5,400 satellites in January 2026. The total is heading toward 70,000+ by 2030. As constellations scale, manual monitoring becomes physically impossible, and every operator will need automated predictive management. If Constellation becomes the standard software layer -- the way Stripe became the standard payment layer -- the TAM grows with every new satellite launched. The federated learning architecture is clever here: each operator's data improves the model without exposing raw telemetry, which could create genuine network effects as the customer base grows. In a world where there are fifty constellation operators instead of fifteen, this looks very different. And defense customers pay premium prices with near-zero churn. If Kamran's SpaceX network opens the first two or three design partner contracts, and those operators become genuinely dependent on the prediction system, this could compound.

But "could" is doing a lot of work in that paragraph. Right now I see strong organic founder-problem fit, real technical schlep, capable builders -- and no evidence that anyone outside the team needs this enough to pay for it. The narrow market with long sales cycles means this team needs to survive on very little revenue for a long time while closing their first real contracts. I'd want to see a named design partner, a signed LOI, or any signal of genuine user pull before writing a check. This is a company I'd watch closely through the YC batch rather than invest in today.
