# Bidflow -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Bidflow is almost a perfect specimen of the pattern I pass on fastest: an AI-powered version of existing software, tagged "SaaS" on its own YC page, built by founders who pivoted into the domain months ago from an unrelated QA testing product. The contact email still reads `founders@tryghostship.dev`. When I look at Beam AI with $48 million in funding and 1,100 customers already doing AI construction takeoffs across multiple trades, and Togal.AI with $17.5 million doing the same, I struggle to find the non-consensus angle. "Use computer vision to count symbols on blueprints" is not an insane idea in 2026 -- it's an obvious one. Every vision model improvement from foundation providers makes this easier for anyone to build. Jesse Choe is clearly a talented engineer -- USACO Platinum, Jane Street extern at 18 -- but technical brilliance applied to a consensus opportunity is exactly the kind of bet where the returns have already been priced in by the time you write the check.

My framework asks a brutal question first: would this business exist without AI? The answer is unambiguously no. Strip away the vision model doing automated symbol counting, and you have nothing -- no crews, no physical assets, no regulatory position, no installed hardware, no protocol other companies build on. The AI IS the product. Compare this to Craftwork, where the moat is the painting crews and the scheduling operations and the quality control infrastructure -- AI makes it better, but the business stands without it. Bidflow is the inverse. It's a tech company pointing at electricians, not an electrical operation amplified by technology. The 83.5% accuracy on takeoffs is a feature that any well-resourced competitor can match with sufficient training data, and Beam AI has sixty times more customers generating that data right now.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement, because the vertical specialization argument is not trivial. NECA labor unit standards, electrical-specific symbol libraries, material assembly logic -- these are genuinely deep domain artifacts that general-purpose construction AI tools may underserve. Togal focuses on square-footage takeoffs, not symbol-level electrical counting. The legacy incumbents are trapped in desktop architectures from the 2000s. The data center construction boom is creating an acute bottleneck specifically in electrical estimating capacity, and the skilled labor shortage makes force-multiplying tools urgent. If Bidflow achieves 95%+ accuracy and builds genuine switching costs through workflow integration and corrected-data flywheels, they could own the electrical vertical the way vertical SaaS companies occasionally do. Bass Electric's testimonial -- 5x reduction in estimate time -- is a real signal of product value. Three named customers at pre-seed is meaningful. But for this bull case to work, Bidflow needs to outrun Beam AI's ability to add electrical depth with $48 million and an existing sales motion, while simultaneously building domain credibility that two young engineers without construction backgrounds don't naturally possess.

The structural problem is that even in the best case, Bidflow is an application sitting on someone else's infrastructure. It doesn't create a new primitive. It doesn't establish a protocol. It doesn't generate network effects where each additional user makes the product structurally more valuable to every other user. The narrative can expand from "electrical estimating" to "all electrical contractor workflows" to maybe "specialty trade estimating" -- but that's exactly the same expansion narrative Beam AI already articulates at much larger scale. The ceiling is visible: vertical SaaS for a specific construction trade. That's a real business -- potentially a $50-100 million revenue business in the best case -- but it's not an infinity story, and it's precisely the category where I believe AI is destroying moats faster than startups can build them.

I respect what Jesse and Gautham have done -- pivoting hard, landing real customers, getting into YC twice. The decade-long co-founder relationship, going back to middle school, is a genuine strength that I weight seriously. But the overall pattern here triggers every filter I've developed since my Birchbox miss: narrative potential without structural defensibility, software as the business rather than the tool, and a competitive landscape where well-funded players are converging on the same obvious opportunity. I'd rather fund the electrical contractor who's using AI to run their operations than the AI company trying to sell software to electrical contractors.
