# Ruma Care -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Ruma Care isn't the AI or the regulatory tailwind -- it's that the CEO used to sit at the desk doing the paperwork this product automates. Meng Fei Shen worked as a Medical Assistant at a rheumatology practice with infusion therapy services. She wasn't studying the problem from a conference room; she was navigating the 70+ portals, making the phone calls, and watching the clinic eat $2,000-$8,000 every time an insurer denied a biologic that had already been administered. That's the kind of founder-market fit I weight heavily. When I co-founded Color Health, the insight that made it work wasn't abstract -- it came from understanding how CLIA-regulated labs actually operated at the workflow level. Shen has that same granular, operational understanding of infusion clinic economics, and she paired it with a CTO in Christina Huang who has built ML systems at Apple and -- critically -- led healthcare integrations with United Healthcare at Medallion. This isn't a team that discovered healthcare from a TechCrunch article.

The structural moment here has two components, and the regulatory one is the more compelling. CMS-0057-F took effect January 1, 2026, compressing PA decision timelines from fourteen days to seven and mandating API-based data exchange by January 2027. This isn't a "maybe someday" regulatory shift -- it's already in effect. Every managed care plan covering 250M+ Americans now faces hard deadlines to digitize PA workflows. Simultaneously, LLM capabilities crossed a threshold where extracting complex, unstructured payer criteria documents became feasible at production-grade quality. The combination creates urgency on both sides: payers must respond faster, and providers need tools to submit cleaner, more complete authorization packets. That's a real "why now" -- not "GPT-4 exists" but "a specific regulatory deadline just hit while the technology to address it became viable."

This company fits my "boring but critical" infrastructure pattern almost perfectly. Prior authorization for biologics makes most investors' eyes glaze over -- it's forms, insurance portals, denial codes, and payer-specific submission criteria. PagerDuty had this same quality. Operations alerting seemed like a niche tool, not a company. But every organization running software needed it, and once embedded, the switching costs were real. Ruma Care has a similar dynamic: every infusion clinic in America faces this problem, the financial exposure is enormous ($720K-$4.8M annually in at-risk revenue per rheumatology practice), and the 50% denial rate reduction they report creates immediate, measurable ROI that should drive retention. The denial-pattern data flywheel is the key defensibility signal -- as the system processes more authorizations across more payer-medication-diagnosis combinations, it accumulates proprietary intelligence about what each insurer actually requires for approval. That compounds in a way that generic form-filling does not.

Where I have real concerns is the competitive landscape and the distribution trajectory. This is not an empty market. CoverMyMeds was acquired by McKesson for $1.1 billion. Cohere Health has $200M in funding. Infinx has $170M in annual revenue. Waystar is public with over a billion in revenue guidance. The bull case is that these incumbents have structural misalignment: CoverMyMeds monetizes from drug manufacturers, not providers; Cohere Health serves payers, not providers; and broad RCM platforms lack the deep specialization in biologics-specific criteria where each medication-diagnosis-payer combination has unique submission requirements. That's a plausible wedge. But the bear case is also real -- the core technology (LLM-based form extraction and criteria matching) is reproducible, and any of these well-resourced players could decide that biologics PA is worth building for. The two-person team faces genuine resource asymmetry. On the distribution side, the free Formulary Navigator is smart lead-gen thinking -- it shows the founders aren't assuming the product sells itself -- but I don't see a clearly articulated multi-product trajectory. Can this become the operating system for infusion clinics? Can the PA workflow expand into full revenue cycle management, patient enrollment, or formulary intelligence as a data product? The bones are there, but the vision hasn't been articulated.

The single-miracle framework maps cleanly here: the one thing that has to work is achieving consistently high approval rates through automated criteria extraction and packet assembly. Unlike Harvey, where the miracle (model fidelity) was being delivered by foundation model labs, Ruma's miracle is more domain-specific -- building comprehensive payer criteria mappings and denial pattern intelligence across the biologics formulary. That's achievable but requires execution discipline and time-in-market to accumulate data. The 50% denial reduction claim and 20x staff time reduction suggest early progress, though these numbers come from the YC page without cohort detail. One risk I'd probe: the buy-and-bill model concentration. If specialty pharmacy distribution shifts toward white-bagging or brown-bagging, the volume of provider-administered biologics -- and therefore Ruma's target customer base -- could shrink. That's not an imminent threat, but it's a structural shift to monitor.

Net assessment: this is a company in a genuinely boring market with a real structural moment, strong founder-market fit, and early execution evidence. The regulatory tailwind is concrete and time-bound. The data flywheel potential is real but unproven at scale. The competitive concern is my primary hesitation -- not because the incumbents are better positioned, but because the technology moat is thin enough that well-funded players could close the gap. I'd want to understand the depth of their payer criteria database, the stickiness of their clinic integrations, and whether they've thought through the expansion from biologics PA to broader infusion clinic infrastructure. This sits in the upper range of "mixed signals with genuine thesis fit" -- a meeting, not an immediate check.
