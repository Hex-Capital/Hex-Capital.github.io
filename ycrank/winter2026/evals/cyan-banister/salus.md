# Salus -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me before anything else: AI agent guardrails might be the single most consensus category in the entire tech landscape right now. Galileo has raised $68 million and is growing 834% year-over-year. Fiddler has $100 million behind it. NVIDIA has an open-source guardrails framework with thousands of GitHub stars. OpenAI's own Agents SDK ships with a guardrails section built in. Gartner has already named the category -- "guardian agents" -- and is predicting it captures 15% of the AI market within four years. When Gartner is already naming your market, and every major infrastructure vendor is building toward it, the weirdness has been arbitraged away entirely. I look for companies where the idea sounds ridiculous to most smart people. Salus is a company where the idea sounds obviously correct to literally everyone. That's not where I find my best investments.

Now, I always want to hear the founder's story before I evaluate the business. And what I see here are two Stanford CS undergraduates who are roommates. Vedant Singh has a genuinely impressive academic record -- International Linguistics Olympiad medal, Schmidt Futures Rise Global Winner, research stints across multiple Stanford labs and MIT. Kevin Pan's background beyond Stanford enrollment isn't documented publicly. These are clearly bright, capable young people. But when I ask my first question -- "tell me how you got here, not the business" -- I don't hear a story about personal struggle that led to this specific problem. I don't hear about an agent that went haywire and cost someone their job, or a founder who spent years in production ML watching autonomous systems fail in ways that kept them up at night. What I hear is two students at one of the most elite institutions in the world who identified a timely market opportunity from inside the AI ecosystem. That's a fine origin, but it's not the biographical thread I look for -- the one where the founder and the problem are fused together through lived experience. The founders who persist through the inevitable crises of building a company are the ones who can't walk away because the problem is personal. When the problem is an intellectual observation, however smart, it's easier to pivot when things get hard.

Let me give the bull case its full due, because it deserves it. The timing insight is genuinely sharp -- we are at an inflection where agents are moving from generating text to executing real-world actions, and that shift creates a new failure mode that existing tooling doesn't address. The pre-execution interception positioning is a meaningful technical distinction from post-hoc observability. The 58% blocked-action recovery rate and the benchmark results on ODCV-Bench suggest these founders have done real engineering work, not just wrapped an API. Vedant's CryptoAgents project -- a multi-agent LLM trading system -- means he's built exactly the kind of system Salus aims to protect. If Salus can become the embedded standard before incumbents catch up, the switching costs from decorators woven throughout agent codebases could create real defensibility. And if you believe the agentic AI market reaches $93 billion by 2032, being the runtime safety layer for that market is an enormous outcome. The "Stripe of agent safety" narrative writes itself.

But that narrative writes itself for every investor, and that's my problem. The dossier itself notes the core concept is "architecturally straightforward" -- intercepting tool calls and checking them against policies. Every observability vendor with SDK access to tool calls can build this. The moat isn't in the interception; it's supposed to emerge from accumulated policy data and switching costs over time. I've seen that movie before, and the incumbents with $68 million and $100 million in the bank and enterprise sales teams are going to move fast into this space precisely because the demand signal is so obvious. Two undergraduates competing against Galileo's Fortune 50 customer base and Fiddler's enterprise infrastructure isn't impossible -- Carta was once a tiny startup competing against established financial services firms -- but Carta was making something invisible visible for a population that lacked access. Salus is making agent actions visible to the engineering teams that built those agents. It's a useful product for well-resourced companies. It's not creating economic opportunity for people who don't have it.

There's nothing here that gives me that jolt -- that intuitive energy I felt with Niantic or the sense of discovering something others were dismissing. Salus is solving a real problem, but it's a problem everyone already agrees exists, in a market crowded with well-funded players, founded by academically accomplished students whose path has been one of consistent institutional validation rather than the kind of outsider grit that tells me a founder won't quit when things get ugly. For a different investor with a different framework, this might be exactly right. For me, it's a pass.
