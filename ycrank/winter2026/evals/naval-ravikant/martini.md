# Martini -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The structural position here is what grabs me first -- not the founders, not the market. Martini sits as an orchestration layer between commodity inputs (third-party AI video models accessible via API) and commodity outputs (video files). This is the thinnest possible value capture position in a technology stack. When I backed Alchemy, the infrastructure layer was essential -- running blockchain nodes is genuinely hard and developers needed abstraction they couldn't build themselves. When I backed Stack Overflow, the knowledge graph compounded with every question asked. Martini's orchestration layer has neither of those properties. Any well-resourced team -- Figma, Adobe, Canva, or the model companies themselves -- can build camera controls, multi-model routing, and timeline assembly. The "Figma for generative film" positioning invokes the right archetype but misses what made Figma defensible: the multiplayer design file was itself the innovation, a new primitive that didn't exist before. Martini's collaboration is a feature added to API routing, not a new primitive.

The specific knowledge question is where I find the most genuine signal. Koh Terai isn't a product manager who read about filmmaking and decided to build tools. He's a cinematographer with Cannes screening credits and a CS degree who went through Stanford's design program. That cross-domain combination -- understanding camera position, lens selection, and movement at an intuitive level while also understanding the technical substrate -- is non-transferable knowledge. You cannot teach someone in six months why a 35mm lens at eye level creates a different emotional register than an 85mm shot from above, and you cannot teach them to translate that understanding into software abstractions. This is the kind of founder-problem authenticity I look for. Long Hoang complements this with genuine engineering depth -- robotics championships, open-source contributions to Supabase, the kind of competitive programming background that signals a real builder. The technical co-founder requirement is met. But I have to be honest about the depth: Koh's filmmaking credits are short films from 2017-2018, not years running commercial production at scale. The insight is real but the network and operational knowledge of professional film workflows may be more academic than battle-tested.

The leverage test is where this falls short for me. Does Martini create a new form of leverage that didn't exist before? The AI video models themselves are the leverage -- they let one person generate what previously required cameras, lighting rigs, and crews. Martini makes that existing leverage more accessible and professional, but accessibility improvement and leverage creation are different things. Notion didn't just make existing productivity tools easier to use -- it created a compound document model that was itself a new form of individual leverage. Replit didn't just add a UI to existing compilers -- it made programming possible for people who would never have opened a terminal. Martini makes existing AI models more professional, which is valuable, but it's operating at the interface layer rather than the leverage layer. The per-second credit pricing tied to pass-through model costs confirms this: the margin structure is that of a reseller with a better storefront.

The timing question is where I'd normally get excited -- and I can't here. "AI video tools for professional filmmakers" is peak consensus in early 2026. Runway just raised $315M at a $5.3B valuation. Luma AI raised $900M. The market is flooded with capital and attention. My best returns -- Twitter, Uber, Bitcoin -- came from betting when smart people actively dismissed the category. Nobody is dismissing AI video right now. The specific sub-thesis -- "model-agnostic orchestration beats vertically integrated models" -- has a contrarian quality within the space, but the meta-positioning is fully consensus. You're not getting paid for being right first when the crowd is already running in your direction.

The bull case I'd construct for someone else: every major creative tool transition has separated engines from workflows. Avid didn't build cameras. Premiere didn't build codecs. If AI video models commoditize -- and multiple simultaneous competitors suggest they will -- the workflow layer becomes the durable position. A cinematographer-founded team building the professional standard for AI filmmaking could become the editorial tool that sits above a commodity model ecosystem. The 200+ films created on platform, the TV commercial productions, the creative partnerships -- these are early signals that professionals are choosing Martini over the model companies' native interfaces. If this pattern holds, the switching costs from project data, team configurations, and NLE export integrations could compound. And the model companies face genuine business model conflict in building model-agnostic routing -- they'd be sending users to competitors. This is a real structural advantage.

But the bull case requires surviving long enough for model commoditization to play out, and Martini is bringing a two-person team and YC funding to a fight where Runway has $860M and Adobe owns the NLE export targets. The technology doesn't compound in any distinctive way -- there's no data flywheel, no knowledge graph, no proprietary science. Each piece of the product (camera controls, multi-model routing, timeline editing, XML export) is individually replicable. The founder's specific knowledge gives them a temporary UX advantage, but cinematography expertise is acquirable -- Adobe or Runway can hire DPs as product consultants. I'm looking for companies where the technology gets harder to replicate over time, and I don't see that mechanism here.
