# Resonate -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is the question I always start with: if Resonate succeeds beyond anyone's expectations, what changes? People get cleaner voice messages with transcriptions and emoji-annotated emotions. Filler words disappear. Messages become searchable. These are features. Good features, perhaps, but features that WhatsApp shipped transcription for in late 2024 and that Apple could deliver through Apple Intelligence in a single iOS update. The consequence of maximum success here is a well-liked consumer app in a market where the incumbents have two billion users and the engineering resources to absorb every differentiating capability Resonate offers. Nobody's world changes. No industry restructures. I cannot find the magnitude that justifies the attempt.

The dossier reveals something I react to viscerally: the company is simultaneously building Resonate Chat (voice messaging), Resonate Create (an "Advanced Agentic Video platform"), with "many more products in the works." At pre-seed. With effectively two people. When Pat Brown came to me, he had one thesis -- replicate meat at the molecular level -- and total conviction that this single problem justified his life's work. When a pre-seed team spreads across multiple product lines, it signals they haven't found the one problem worth their full commitment. They're searching, not building. The YC description admits "a desperate need for virality and growth" -- when you describe your own distribution challenge as desperate, you're acknowledging that the product hasn't earned its own pull. Products that transform industries don't need to beg for distribution; they create demand because the alternative suddenly looks intolerable.

The technology layer compounds my concern. Speech-to-text, filler-word removal, emotion detection from vocal tone, text-to-video generation -- every component is available through commodity APIs. OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, off-the-shelf sentiment models. The dossier itself flags that "replication by a funded competitor or incumbent is technically feasible" and that multiple other YC W26 companies are building in adjacent agentic video spaces. There is no proprietary technology here, no novel algorithm, no unique dataset that improves with scale. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu had invented a fundamentally different router architecture that Cisco couldn't replicate without abandoning their own design philosophy. That's technology disruption -- making the incumbent's approach structurally obsolete. Resonate is assembling existing APIs into a consumer interface. That's integration work, and integration alone has never been a durable moat against a platform owner with billions of captive users.

The strongest bull case would go like this: voice-first communication is on an exponential adoption curve (49% growth since 2020), and there's a window to build a messaging platform where AI isn't bolted on but is the native substrate -- the way Slack wasn't just "email with chat" but a fundamentally different communication paradigm. If AI-processed voice becomes the primary modality for younger users, and if the platform that gets this right captures network effects before incumbents fully adapt, the winner could displace WhatsApp the way WhatsApp displaced SMS. I take this argument seriously in the abstract. But the product evidence contradicts it: Resonate Chat as described is a set of enhancements layered on top of existing voice message behavior, not a new communication paradigm. Transcription, emotion highlights, and filler removal are improvements to the existing format, not a replacement of it. The cross-app import feature -- pulling messages from WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram -- actually reinforces the incumbents' centrality rather than displacing them. You're building a processing layer on top of someone else's platform, which is a dependency, not a disruption.

Sam Kaplan's background is competent -- Harvard CS, engineering management at Brex during high-growth scaling, AI side projects showing technical curiosity. Lily Zhao brings product and business development experience from Instacart and an AI content company. These are solid resumes from inside the establishment. But my highest-returning investments have come from outsiders who didn't know what the industry considered impossible. A former Brex engineering manager building a messaging app with commodity AI features is the opposite of that pattern -- it's an insider executing a safe playbook in a well-understood category. I see no evidence of contrarian courage, no thesis that experts dismiss as crazy, no willingness to attempt something the consensus deems impossible. Building a better voice message experience is something everyone agrees would be nice. When everyone agrees, the upside is already priced in.

This is a capable team building a technically competent product that addresses a real but small pain point in a market dominated by platforms with billions of users and unlimited AI budgets. They have reduced their probability of failure by choosing proven technology and a clear user need -- and in doing so, they have made the consequence of their success inconsequential. I would tell Sam and Lily: you're clearly talented engineers and operators. Go find a problem that terrifies you and that the world needs solved. This isn't it.
