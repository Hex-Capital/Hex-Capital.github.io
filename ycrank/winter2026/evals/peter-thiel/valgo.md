# Valgo -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking thing about Valgo is a paradox that sits at the heart of my investment framework: the founders have literally published their secret. Moss and Katz co-authored the MIT Press textbook "Algorithms for Validation," teach the Stanford course on safety-critical systems validation, and were core members of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory team that designed ACAS X -- the FAA-certified collision avoidance system that became an international standard. These are not founders who have stumbled onto a hidden truth. These are founders who have broadcast their truth to every graduate student, defense contractor, and autonomy company that cares to read it. The intellectual depth is extraordinary -- genuinely among the most credentialed founding teams I have encountered for any specific problem domain. But my question is not "do these founders know more than anyone else?" My question is: "What is the secret?" And a secret that has been organized into textbook chapters and taught in a university course is no longer a secret. It is a curriculum.

The underlying thesis -- that Bayesian and surrogate-model approaches can discover rare failure modes orders of magnitude more efficiently than brute-force Monte Carlo simulation -- is a real and important insight. In academia, it is well-established. In industry, practitioners still rely heavily on exhaustive simulation, which creates a genuine gap between what is known and what is practiced. That gap is a real business opportunity. But it is the kind of opportunity that Paul Graham would call a "schlep" -- a problem hidden by institutional inertia rather than by conceptual difficulty. It is not the kind of truth that most intelligent people would argue against. No serious engineer at Applied Intuition or Ansys would claim that brute-force simulation is theoretically optimal. They simply have not built the better approach yet, in part because they are busy building full-stack simulation platforms. The distinction matters: a secret that people reject creates a structural monopoly because competitors cannot copy what they do not believe. A truth that people acknowledge but have not yet implemented creates a temporary lead that erodes as the market catches up.

The competitive landscape is the most troubling dimension. Applied Intuition sits at a $15 billion valuation with $1.2 billion raised and is expanding into defense -- precisely the domain where Valgo's founders have the deepest credentials. Foretellix has raised $135 million for scenario-based validation. Ansys and Siemens are incumbents with multi-billion-dollar revenue bases. This is not a market with no players -- it is a market with well-funded players who could add algorithmic validation as a feature on top of their existing simulation infrastructure. Valgo's black-box, simulator-agnostic approach is genuinely differentiated, but it is differentiated as a component, not as a platform. History teaches that components get absorbed by platforms. When Applied Intuition decides to hire three graduates of the Stanford course that Moss and Katz teach, the algorithmic advantage narrows considerably. The Girardian risk here is real: Valgo enters a market where the dominant players are already competing mimetically, and rather than escaping competition entirely, they are positioning themselves as a complementary layer that the dominant player can eventually replicate internally.

The strongest bull case runs through defense and regulatory capture -- and it is a case worth taking seriously. The Palantir analogy is instructive: Palantir started by selling data-fusion tools to the CIA, became indispensable through deep integration, and created switching costs that grew with every year of deployment. If Valgo focused exclusively on FAA certification for autonomous aircraft and DoD validation requirements for autonomous systems, they could become the standard that regulators recognize and mandate. The founders' ACAS X credential is not just academic polish -- it is proof that they have already navigated the exact regulatory process that their future customers must survive. A company that becomes the regulatory standard for safety validation achieves monopoly through mandate, not through market competition. This is a genuine path to defensibility, and the founders have the specific credentials to walk it. But I see no evidence they have committed to this path. Their website lists seven target industries -- aviation, automotive, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance. A two-person team targeting seven verticals is the opposite of the small-market dominance strategy that defines every great monopoly. Facebook started at Harvard. PayPal started with eBay power sellers. Palantir started with the CIA. Valgo appears to be starting everywhere, which in practice means starting nowhere.

I respect the founders' intellectual caliber. The ACAS X deployment proves they can bridge the gap between theory and real-world systems -- a gap that kills most academic founders. The Public Benefit Corporation structure suggests genuine conviction about the civilizational importance of safe autonomy, which I value. If they narrowed ruthlessly to defense and aviation, built deep integrations with DoD and FAA certification workflows, and positioned themselves not as a validation tool but as the regulatory infrastructure layer for autonomous systems, this could become a consequential company. But the current positioning -- a pluggable algorithmic validation layer for any simulator in any industry -- is a feature looking for a platform, not a monopoly looking for its first market. The technology is real, the founders are exceptional, and the market need is genuine. What is missing is the monopoly architecture. Without it, Valgo risks becoming the best validation algorithm inside someone else's simulation platform -- a fate that rewards the platform owner, not the algorithm inventor.
