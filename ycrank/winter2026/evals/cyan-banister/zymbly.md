# Zymbly -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Zymbly: this is the startup that a team of Oliver Wyman consultants would build after spending a decade studying aviation MRO inefficiency. And they did. All three co-founders trace back to Oliver Wyman. The idea is logical, well-researched, the market sizing is clean, the regulatory pre-work is thoughtful, and the design partnership with a major airline is exactly the kind of validation a consulting team would secure before launch. It's competent. It's sensible. And that's precisely my problem with it. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Crusoe Energy, Contraline -- were companies that looked unreasonable to smart, well-credentialed people. Zymbly looks reasonable to everyone. An AI copilot for aircraft maintenance technicians drowning in paperwork during a 43,000-person labor shortage? No one is going to tell you that's crazy. Which means the price discovery on this opportunity is already happening, and CAMP Systems launching its own AI Operations Manager in October 2025 tells me the incumbents agree it's obvious too.

When I evaluate founders, the first thing I want to hear is the story -- not the business case, but how this person ended up here, and whether the thread from their life to this company is unbreakable. Robbie Bourke's career is genuinely impressive: 25 years in aviation, Head of Aircraft Maintenance at Virgin Atlantic, lead engineer at Airbus, partner at Oliver Wyman. He has lived inside the hangar. He has managed the very technicians whose workflow Zymbly automates. That's rare domain authority, and it matters enormously in a space where trust is everything. But domain authority earned through a distinguished career is different from the biographical urgency I look for -- the kind of personal stake where the founder cannot walk away because the problem is woven into who they are. Bourke could go back to consulting, advising, sitting on boards. His LinkedIn still lists him as an aviation leader, board member, advisor. I don't know if he's fully committed or if Zymbly is one of several things on his plate, and that ambiguity at the co-founder level worries me.

Where Zymbly genuinely earns my respect is in choosing to build inside one of the hardest operating environments in tech: safety-critical aviation, regulated by the FAA, EASA, and CAA. This is a space I understand from my IronPort years -- when you're building technology where errors have real consequences, the compliance burden is immense and it filters out most founders who can't stomach the process. The team has already aligned with Part 145 operations, CAME standards, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 Type II. They've built in human sign-off friction so AI never acts autonomously on maintenance actions. That's the right instinct for a safety-critical environment, and it creates genuine barriers for the many AI startups that would try to enter this space without understanding the regulatory landscape. The "AI overlay on existing ERP" positioning is smart too -- it avoids the political fight of ripping and replacing entrenched systems, which is where most enterprise startups die in aviation.

Let me give the bull case its due, because there's a version of this that works beautifully. If Bourke is fully committed and leverages his network across Virgin Atlantic, Airbus, and the broader MRO world, this team could land enterprise contracts that would take outsiders years to access. The design partnership with a major global airline is meaningful evidence that someone with decision-making authority already trusts them. The 43,000-technician shortage creates genuine urgency -- this isn't a nice-to-have, it's a workforce crisis. And the data moat could compound: every troubleshooting query, every parts lookup, every compliance document drafted accumulates proprietary patterns that make the system better for the next airline. If they can get three to five major airline deployments in the next 18 months, the switching costs and data advantage could create a real defensible position. The voice-first interaction model is differentiated from what the incumbents are doing -- CAMP and EmpowerMX are adding AI to existing interfaces, not reimagining the point-of-work experience.

But I keep coming back to the core tension: this company doesn't activate the pattern recognition that's driven my best investments. There's no "jolt" here. The economic impact flows to airlines and MRO providers, not to the individual technicians in any transformative way -- it makes their existing jobs less frustrating, which is valuable but isn't the kind of economic access creation I saw with Uber putting income in drivers' pockets or Affirm making credit transparent for people who'd been excluded. The technology -- RAG over maintenance manuals plus voice-to-text -- uses widely available building blocks. The real moat is domain expertise and regulatory navigation, and those are real, but they're also what any well-networked aviation consultant could replicate. I respect what Zymbly is building, and I think there's a good business here. But a good business that smart insiders would build in a consensus market isn't the kind of bet I write checks for. I'm looking for the founders and ideas that make people uncomfortable, and this one makes everyone nod.
