# Sparkles -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

"Lovable for existing projects." That is how Sparkles describes itself on its YC launch page. Stop and consider what this formulation reveals. The company is defining its identity through reference to a competitor — not articulating what it uniquely sees about the world, but positioning itself as a variant of someone else's category. This is mimetic positioning in its purest form. Girard would recognize it instantly: the model and the imitator locked in a rivalry where the imitator adopts the model's desire as its own. Lovable built a new category — AI-generated greenfield applications — and Sparkles has responded by saying "yes, that, but for existing codebases." The problem is structural. When you define yourself as a modifier of someone else's noun, you have already conceded that the original noun owns the category. You are competing, and competition destroys value.

The question I always begin with is: what is the secret? What does this founder believe about the world that most intelligent people actively disagree with? The implicit thesis is that non-technical team members should be able to edit existing production codebases without engineering involvement. But this is not a secret — it is a consensus observation. Every product manager, every marketer, every operations lead at every software company has experienced the bottleneck of waiting for an engineer to change a button color. The entire AI coding industry — Cursor at $29 billion, Lovable at $6.6 billion, Replit at $3 billion — shares the broad thesis that AI will democratize code modification. Sparkles occupies a slightly different point in this consensus space (existing codebases rather than greenfield), but the underlying insight is universally held. When I ask "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" and the answer is something every VP of Marketing already knows from personal frustration, there is no secret. There is just a recognized pain point that a dozen well-funded companies are converging on from different angles.

The competitive landscape here is not merely crowded — it is structurally hostile to a new entrant. Cursor has raised $3.4 billion and generates over $1 billion in ARR. Lovable has $200 million in ARR. Claude Code already enables non-technical users to trigger AI-generated pull requests through GitHub issue comments — the foundation model providers are building this feature into their own tools. The core technology stack Sparkles assembles — sandboxed environments, LLM API calls, GitHub PR creation — is composed entirely of commodity components. There is no proprietary technology here, no 10x improvement, no capability that did not exist before. The product is an integration layer with a friendly interface, which is useful but not defensible. A well-resourced competitor — or an intern at GitHub — could replicate this surface in a quarter. When I backed Stripe, the Collison brothers had built a payments API that was genuinely an order of magnitude simpler than anything available, and that technical superiority compounded over years of integration depth. Sparkles has no analogous technical moat.

The strongest bull case would require several things to be simultaneously true: that the large AI coding incumbents systematically ignore the existing-codebase niche because their architectures are optimized for generation rather than editing; that enterprise switching costs from GitHub workflow integration accumulate faster than competitors can replicate them; and that this 20-year-old solo founder can execute an enterprise sales motion targeting VPs of Operations while simultaneously building and maintaining the product alone. Each of these conditions is possible in isolation. Together, they constitute an improbable conjunction. The more fundamental problem is that even if all three obtain, the ceiling is a useful SaaS tool with healthy margins — not a monopoly. There is no network effect that makes Sparkles structurally stronger with each additional customer. There is no flywheel. The hundredth enterprise customer does not make the product better for the first, which means the company must perpetually out-execute on product and sales rather than riding compounding structural advantages. That trajectory produces a good business at best, not the kind of power-law outcome that justifies a check from my portfolio.

The founder, Bekirov, is 20, a UCL dropout, and building alone. I have no categorical objection to youth — Buterin was 19 when he conceived Ethereum, and I gave him a fellowship check. But Buterin had a specific, detailed vision for programmable money that most cryptographers thought was either impossible or unnecessary. His conviction was visible in the architecture of the system he designed, not just in his willingness to drop out. What I see from Bekirov is domain familiarity — Cursor Ambassador, engineer at two YC startups — and the courage to go solo in San Francisco at twenty. That is admirable. But domain familiarity is not the same as a definite vision for the future, and courage is not the same as a contrarian thesis. The tagline "make everyone on your team an engineer" is aspirational language, not a plan. I do not see the intellectual architecture — the specific, non-obvious theory of why the world works differently than everyone believes — that separates founders who build monopolies from founders who build features.

This is a feature, not a company. And the companies whose feature it most naturally becomes — Cursor, GitHub, Lovable — have billions in resources to build it whenever they choose.
