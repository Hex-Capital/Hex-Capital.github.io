# Crosslayer Labs -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what's fascinating and frustrating about Crosslayer Labs in equal measure: these founders invented MPIC, a standard that now secures every HTTPS certificate issued on the internet -- roughly 8 million per day, covering 700 million websites. They wrote the paper, built the first implementation, co-authored the CA/Browser Forum ballot that made it mandatory, and won the IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize for the open-source implementation. That is a genuine protocol-layer achievement. Prateek Mittal won the ACM Grace Hopper Award for "enhancing internet privacy and security." This team has shaped how the internet actually works. And then they took all of that protocol-layer credibility and... built a SaaS monitoring dashboard. That's the gap that kills this for me.

The sane-person-insane-idea filter is supposed to be a pairing. These founders are among the most technically credible I've seen at pre-seed -- a tenured Princeton professor with research awards from Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and Intel, plus two PhD researchers who demonstrated live BGP attacks against certificate infrastructure. The "sane" axis is maxed out. But the idea -- "monitor enterprise attack surfaces across DNS, BGP, TLS, and JavaScript layers" -- is precisely the kind of thing every cybersecurity VC would immediately understand and approve of. Attack surface management is a well-mapped, well-funded category with Censys at $131M raised, CyCognito at $800M valuation, and CrowdStrike bolting on EASM via acquisition. When the TAM slide and competitive landscape both write themselves, I know I'm looking at a consensus play. The returns on consensus plays are consensus returns.

The structural moat problem is what I'd push hardest on. The team's knowledge moat is real -- a decade of research on cross-layer internet infrastructure attacks is genuinely difficult to replicate. But the PRODUCT is software. Enterprise security SaaS. The cross-layer correlation engine is differentiated today, but here's my "AI kill test": can a well-resourced incumbent build similar correlation logic on top of their existing data feeds within 18 months? CrowdStrike already has endpoint telemetry, threat intelligence graphs, and EASM scanning. Cloudflare already offers free BGP hijack monitoring. The individual signal sources -- DNS monitoring, BGP route analysis, Certificate Transparency logs, JavaScript dependency tracking -- are all available as existing tools. Crosslayer's insight is correlating them. That correlation logic is valuable but it's software, and software moats are dissolving faster than founders believe. I'd rather fund a company where the moat is physical infrastructure or regulatory position that AI cannot replicate.

What genuinely tempts me is the protocol-layer angle -- and this is where only my framework catches the tragedy of the situation. These founders created a real internet primitive. MPIC is infrastructure that other systems build on. That's exactly the kind of thing I fund -- Aleo, Helium, Lightning Labs, Algorand. But unlike those investments, where I'm buying into a protocol that captures value as adoption compounds, MPIC is open-source and regulatory-mandated. The protocol has been given to the world. The company isn't monetizing the primitive; it's building an application adjacent to the primitive. It's as if Satoshi launched Bitcoin, made it completely open, and then started a Bitcoin wallet company. The wallet might be good, but the asymmetric return was in owning the protocol layer. Crosslayer Labs occupies the application layer above its own protocol, and application-layer companies get absorbed.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. If the MPIC standardization work translates into distribution -- the team has deep relationships with Google, Apple, Amazon, Let's Encrypt, and Sectigo from years of CA/Browser Forum collaboration -- that's an enterprise sales pipeline that money can't buy. Security companies with deep protocol expertise sometimes become acquisition targets at premium multiples (Area 1 Security to Cloudflare for ~$162M). And cybersecurity is one of the few SaaS categories where AI might strengthen rather than weaken moats, because attackers also leverage AI, creating an arms race that rewards deep domain knowledge. If cross-layer correlation becomes a recognized security category the way zero-trust did, the team that defined the category could own it. For this to work, though, you'd need the monitoring product to evolve into infrastructure that other security tools integrate with -- becoming a primitive, not just a product. I don't see evidence of that trajectory in the current positioning, which reads as a classic B2B SaaS enterprise sales motion with demo requests and vertical targeting.

Bottom line: world-class founders pursuing a well-understood opportunity in a crowded category. The team's protocol-layer achievement is extraordinary, but the company is an application-layer SaaS play. My entire thesis says software is a business tool, not a business model, and I don't see the structural moat that survives the next three platform shifts. I'd love to fund these people doing something genuinely insane -- rebuilding internet routing infrastructure, creating a decentralized trust protocol, anything that leverages their protocol-layer genius at the protocol layer. But a security monitoring SaaS, no matter how technically sophisticated, sits in exactly the category where I think incumbents with distribution win.
