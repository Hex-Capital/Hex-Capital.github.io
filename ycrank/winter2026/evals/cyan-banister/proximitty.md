# Proximitty -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Proximitty, and it's not the product: this market is getting crowded fast. LoanPro has $100 million in funding and $24 million in revenue. Prodigal is YC-backed with $14 million and just launched proAgent -- an AI agent for consumer finance that lands directly on top of Proximitty's core thesis. Sedric raised $22 million for compliance monitoring alone. When I see four well-funded companies converging on the same insight in the same window, the signal I trust most -- that the company is unpopular, that it's difficult to assess, that most investors think it's crazy -- evaporates. Nobody thinks AI for lending and collections is crazy right now. Everybody thinks it's the next big thing. And in my experience, by the time everybody thinks something is the next big thing, the price is wrong and the opportunity for outsized returns has already been compressed. I invested in Uber when ride-sharing was illegal in most cities, not when a dozen ride-sharing companies were racing each other to market.

When I sit down with founders, before anything else, I want their story. Not the business -- the human journey that led them here. With Proximitty, what I find are strong credentials: Wye Yew Ho went to LSE, worked at McKinsey, led growth at Taptap Send. Zi Zhang spent five years at Bloomberg building security infrastructure and maintains an impressive open-source AI agent platform with nearly 5,000 GitHub stars. These are accomplished people. But I can't find the thread. Where's the lived connection to collections, to borrower distress, to what it actually feels like when a family member can't make a loan payment and the calls start coming? Taptap Send is fintech-adjacent -- international remittance -- but it's not the same pain. McKinsey consulting teaches you to analyze problems; it doesn't teach you to feel them in your bones. The founders I back at the earliest stages are the ones where the biography and the mission are inseparable, where you can't tell where the person ends and the company begins. I don't see that here, and at pre-seed, when there's no meaningful traction data to override my intuition, that absence weighs heavily.

I do want to engage honestly with the bull case, because there's a version of this that works. The timing convergence is real -- LLMs can now handle nuanced, regulation-heavy conversations that were impossible two years ago, BNPL has flooded collections pipelines beyond what human agents can handle, and browser-use AI enables no-code automation that could genuinely transform legacy workflows. The complementary skill set is precise: fintech domain knowledge plus AI agent infrastructure expertise. The unified data layer approach is architecturally sound -- if you can become the system of record that connects a lender's LMS, dialer, email, and internal tools, the switching costs are material. Zhang's ACI.dev work demonstrates he's actually built agent orchestration infrastructure before, not just fine-tuned prompts and called it AI. And the claim of "publicly traded fintechs and banks" as customers, while unverified, would be a meaningful signal at this stage if true. If this team can outexecute the better-funded competition through a genuinely integrated, AI-native architecture while incumbents are still bolting agents onto legacy systems, there's a real business here.

But here's where my framework pushes back: the product vision spans a unified data layer, risk scoring models, voice AI agents, omni-channel collections, real-time multi-regulation compliance monitoring, and computer-vision browser automation. That's an extraordinary surface area for two people. And this is a regulated industry where enterprise sales cycles run 6 to 18 months and a single compliance failure could destroy customer trust overnight. When I backed Crusoe Energy through their 2020 crisis, we had the luxury of deep hands-on support -- Jonathan literally embedded full-time. But even with that, it required founders whose personal commitment to the problem was so deep that walking away wasn't an option. The biographical fuel that sustains founders through 18-month sales cycles, compliance scares, and well-funded competitors eating into their pipeline -- I need to see evidence of it. I also notice Zhang's LinkedIn shows dual affiliations between ACI.dev (which raised $3 million separately) and Proximitty. I'd want clarity on whether attention is divided.

One thing a generic analyst might miss: collections is a system that's largely invisible to most Americans until it happens to them, and when it does, it's often dehumanizing. There's a real opportunity here to make that system more transparent and humane -- an AI agent with full borrower context could theoretically offer better hardship plans and more dignified treatment than an overworked human collector reading from a script. That pattern of making invisible systems visible is one I gravitate toward, and it's what drew me to Affirm and Carta. But the dossier positions Proximitty entirely as a tool for lenders to improve collection rates and reduce costs. I don't see the borrower-first narrative. I don't see who beyond the lending institution benefits. Without that framing, this is an efficiency play, not an access play, and efficiency plays don't keep me up at night with excitement.

This is a competent team building in a real market at the right moment, and I respect the regulatory complexity they're taking on. But it doesn't activate the signals I've learned to trust. The founders' story doesn't explain why this problem is theirs. The market is trending toward consensus, not away from it. And the company's framing prioritizes lender efficiency over borrower dignity. I'm passing -- not because the business won't work, but because it's not my kind of bet.
