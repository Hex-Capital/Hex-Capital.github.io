# Ruma Care -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells you everything you need to know about whether a secret exists. CoverMyMeds was acquired by McKesson for $1.1 billion in 2017. Cohere Health has raised $200 million. Infinitus Systems has $103 million from Andreessen Horowitz. Waystar is a public company guiding toward a billion dollars in revenue. Infinx processes $170 million in annual revenue. And now Ruma Care -- two founders, pre-seed -- enters the prior authorization automation market and claims to have found something these heavily capitalized players missed. The question answers itself: when five well-funded companies and multiple incumbents are all working on the same problem, there is no secret. There is only competition. Prior authorization is broken -- this is not a truth that few people agree with. The AMA publishes position papers about it. CMS has issued final rules to fix it. Insurers have made public commitments to streamline it. The entire healthcare establishment is in violent agreement that PA is a problem. Consensus problems do not produce monopolies.

The "biologics-first" positioning is the most interesting element, and it deserves honest scrutiny. Shen worked as a Medical Assistant at San Mateo Rheumatology -- she has directly experienced the workflow of infusion clinics losing $2,000 to $8,000 per denied biologic authorization, 30 to 50 times per month. That is genuine domain knowledge, not second-hand market research. The buy-and-bill model creates financial exposure that is unusual in healthcare: the provider has already purchased an $80,000-per-year drug and is waiting for reimbursement, which means a denied PA is not merely an inconvenience but a direct financial loss measured in thousands of dollars. This creates willingness to pay for automation that is structurally higher than in typical PA workflows. The niche is real, the pain is acute, and the founder knows it firsthand. If I were Paul Graham, I would be excited -- this is a textbook example of a founder who stumbled into a genuine problem through lived experience.

But I am not Paul Graham, and organic problem discovery is not the same as a contrarian secret. The bull case for Ruma Care requires believing three things simultaneously: first, that biologics-specific PA is sufficiently specialized that broad platforms cannot serve it well; second, that the denial-pattern data accumulated by processing biologics PAs creates a compounding advantage; and third, that CoverMyMeds, Waystar, or Epic will not build a biologics module when the market opportunity becomes visible. The first premise is plausible -- each medication-diagnosis-payer combination has unique submission criteria, and broad platforms lack incentive to build deep specialization for a narrow initial market. The second is speculative -- data flywheels require scale, and a two-person pre-seed company is far from the volume needed. The third is the critical vulnerability. The underlying technology is LLM-based form extraction and criteria matching -- application-layer work on top of commodity models. This is reproducible by any well-resourced healthcare IT company within eighteen months. When I backed Stripe, the Collison brothers had built a developer-first payments API that represented a genuine category creation -- there was no "payments module" inside an existing platform that did what Stripe did. Ruma Care is building a better-configured version of functionality that already exists across multiple platforms.

The regulatory dynamic compounds the concern rather than alleviating it. CMS-0057-F took effect January 2026, requiring faster PA decisions and specific denial reasons, with API-based exchange requirements following in 2027. This is presented as a tailwind, but it cuts both ways. The regulation is explicitly designed to reduce the PA burden -- if it succeeds, the addressable problem shrinks. More importantly, the API standardization requirements will make it easier for any player to build PA automation, lowering the technical barriers that currently give specialized knowledge some value. You are building a company whose core value proposition depends on a problem that the federal government is actively trying to eliminate. That is the opposite of durability.

The one dimension where Ruma Care fits my framework is the small-market dominance strategy. Starting with rheumatology infusion clinics in California and Nevada, then expanding to all infusion clinics, then all specialty medications, then all PA -- that is the right sequence. The Formulary Navigator as a free lead-generation tool shows tactical sophistication. And the claimed metrics -- 50% denial rate reduction, 20x staff time reduction -- if sustained and verified, represent meaningful product-market fit within the niche. But a good go-to-market strategy inside a competitive market with no structural moat is not sufficient. You can dominate a small beachhead and still lose when a larger player decides the beachhead matters. The small market must be a launching pad for monopoly, not a refuge from competition.

The founders are competent -- Uber One scaled to 13 million members, Apple ML engineering, NASA JPL -- but competence is not conviction. I see no evidence that Shen or Huang have articulated a definite vision for how Ruma Care transforms healthcare beyond "automate PA for biologics." No refusal of an easier path. No civilizational framing. No indication that this company, at maximum success, becomes something other than a well-run vertical SaaS business that processes prior authorizations more efficiently. The power law demands that every investment have the potential to return the entire fund. Even in the most optimistic scenario -- Ruma Care dominates biologics PA, expands to all specialty PA, captures significant share of the $16 billion projected ePA market -- the outcome is a solid business, not a transformative one. The absence of a genuine secret, combined with a crowded competitive landscape and reproducible technology, means this company is structurally bounded in its upside. I pass.
