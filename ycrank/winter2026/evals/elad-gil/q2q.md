# Q2Q -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Q2Q is the competitive dynamics unfolding around it. Datasite acquired both Grata and SourceScrub in 2025 and committed $500M to build out private market intelligence. That's not background noise -- it's a well-capitalized incumbent signaling explicit intent to own the end-to-end deal sourcing workflow. Some founders would pitch this as an opportunity: "the incumbent is distracted by integration." But Datasite isn't a slow-moving legacy player fumbling an acquisition. They're a sophisticated platform operator buying the exact companies that sit upstream of Q2Q's value chain. When your two primary data sources get absorbed by a single entity with half a billion dollars earmarked for expansion, "incumbent distraction" is optimistic framing. The more likely scenario is that Datasite adds outbound automation to its combined Grata/SourceScrub platform within 18 months -- and it has the existing PE firm relationships to distribute it.

The structural moment question here is weak. What changed in the last 12-24 months? LLMs got good enough for personalized outreach and AI voice agents crossed a quality threshold. That's real, but it's the exact same "why now" that every AI SDR company in the YC batch is citing. AI-powered outbound automation is not a non-obvious market -- it's one of the most consensus categories in AI right now. 11x, Artisan, Instantly, and dozens of others are attacking automated outreach with tens of millions in funding. Q2Q's answer is vertical specificity: "we're the AI SDR for PE deal sourcing." But vertical narrowing on top of a consensus horizontal doesn't create a non-obvious market -- it creates a niche within a crowded one. The PE deal sourcing buyer base is thousands of firms, not millions of businesses. When I invested in Gusto, payroll seemed boring but served every employer in America. When I backed PagerDuty, alerting seemed niche but every company running software needed it. PE deal sourcing is genuinely niche in a way that constrains the upside -- there isn't a hidden 10x in the market size when you look past the surface.

There's also a structural tension in the product that concerns me. PE deal sourcing is fundamentally a relationship and trust business. A business owner considering selling their company -- often their life's work -- expects serious, personal attention from a credible buyer. AI-generated emails and AI phone agents calling to "confirm availability" risk undermining exactly the trust signal that makes outreach effective. This isn't like AI SDR for SaaS sales, where a meeting request from a bot is mildly annoying but acceptable. The stakes are categorically different when you're asking someone to consider a life-changing transaction. Q2Q might need two miracles: (1) outreach quality high enough to book meetings at rates justifying the cost, and (2) PE firms willing to let AI represent their brand in a context where personal credibility is the entire currency. That's a compounding-odds problem.

The strongest bull case for Q2Q is Brianna Lin's founder-market fit. She was a PE analyst at a buyout firm and an investment banker at Jefferies. She literally performed the manual workflow Q2Q automates. The search fund and independent sponsor community is tight-knit enough that a founder with credibility and a working product could achieve rapid adoption through network effects within that community. If Q2Q can build a proprietary data flywheel -- learning which outreach messages and approaches yield the highest response rates across industries and geographies -- that compounding advantage could create real defensibility. And the product-to-distribution path exists in theory: start with sourcing automation, expand into due diligence workflow, deal management, portfolio monitoring. If Q2Q becomes the operating system for deal execution, not just deal sourcing, the TAM expands meaningfully. For this bull case to work, Q2Q would need to (a) acquire PE customers faster than Datasite can ship outbound features, (b) prove that AI outreach actually works in this high-trust context, and (c) expand beyond sourcing before horizontal AI SDR platforms add a "PE mode" with minimal customization. That's possible, but it's three things that need to go right, not one.

What I keep coming back to is the commoditization risk the dossier itself identifies. Every component of Q2Q -- company databases, LLM-generated personalization, AI voice calling, calendar booking -- is available as an API. The domain-specific tuning for PE is real but thin. A well-resourced horizontal player adding PE templates, integrating PitchBook data, and offering a "deal sourcing mode" could approximate Q2Q's value proposition without building from scratch. The barrier isn't technology -- it's integration quality and domain credibility. Brianna's PE background provides the credibility, but credibility is a founder advantage, not a product moat. This feels more software-aware than software-driven: the AI is enhancing a fundamentally human-relationship workflow rather than creating a new category of software-native value that compounds over time.
