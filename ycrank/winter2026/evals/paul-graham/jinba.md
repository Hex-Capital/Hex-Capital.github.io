# Jinba -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Jinba is the competitive landscape. Enterprise workflow automation with AI-generated logic is exactly the kind of idea that sounds great in a brainstorming session — "what if you could describe workflows in plain English?" — and that's the problem. Zapier has $310M in revenue and 8,000 connectors. Workato has raised $421M and already launched AI agents. n8n has raised $253M and is growing 6x year-over-year. When I said the most impressive YC companies I've seen recently aren't working on AI, this is the kind of company I was thinking about. Not because AI workflow automation is bad — it's obviously useful — but because when every well-funded incumbent is racing to add the same capability, being a small startup in that category means you need something they structurally cannot replicate. I don't see what that is here.

The origin of the idea concerns me. Matsumori comes from Preferred Networks, one of Japan's best AI labs. Norisugi comes from McKinsey. Together they have the skills to build an AI-powered enterprise tool — but the dossier contains no story about how they stumbled into workflow automation specifically. Were they personally drowning in broken approval processes? Did they watch colleagues at McKinsey or PFN waste hours on manual workflows and think "I have to fix this"? Maybe. But nothing in the evidence suggests it. The positioning as "vibe-coding for workflows" borrows a trending term to describe a trending application of trending technology. That triple-trending combination is almost always a sign the idea was assembled from market analysis rather than discovered through frustration. Stripe wasn't "vibe-coding for payments." It was Patrick Collison being unable to accept online payments without wanting to throw his computer out the window.

The 40,000 enterprise users claim is the most interesting puzzle in the dossier. If it's real, everything changes — that would be genuine user pull in financial services, one of the hardest markets to crack. Suntory is a real company, and the testimonial from their Ph.D. senior specialist suggests actual product usage, not just a pilot agreement. But no third-party source confirms the 40K figure, and it likely comes from the prior Carnot product in Japan, not from Jinba's current US-market positioning. Enterprise users in Japanese financial institutions who adopted a Japanese product under a different brand name are not the same as organic US market demand. The geographic transition from Tokyo to San Francisco is ambitious and shows drive, but enterprise sales relationships don't transfer across oceans and regulatory regimes. SOC 2 Type II is still in progress. They're essentially starting the US enterprise sales cycle from scratch.

The bull case would look like this: Matsumori's deep ML expertise (published at ICCV, contributed to Chainer and CuPy) means the AI workflow generation is genuinely better than what incumbents can bolt on. The on-prem deployment capability is a real differentiator for regulated industries — Zapier can't offer that, and Workato's architecture wasn't built for it. If the Japan financial services traction is real and transferable, Jinba has something most pre-seed companies don't: proof that large, conservative institutions will actually adopt the product. The McKinsey + ML PhD combination is strong for enterprise AI sales. And maybe the Japan market itself is the beachhead — a place to get profitable and build workflow templates before competing head-on with US incumbents. For this to work, though, the AI generation quality needs to be dramatically better than what Workato Genies and n8n's AI features deliver, and I don't see evidence that it is.

The technical founder signal is genuinely strong. Matsumori has a real ML research pedigree — Preferred Networks is world-class, and contributing to deep learning frameworks like Chainer shows he can build infrastructure, not just applications. Both founders have ML backgrounds. The product exists and works. On the technical-hacker-founder dimension, this team passes. But technical competence doesn't overcome a market structure problem. The schlep here — enterprise compliance, on-prem deployment, financial services regulations — is real but well-understood. Workato and Tray.io have been navigating it for years. This isn't the kind of schlep that causes unconscious avoidance. It's the kind that costs money to solve, and the incumbents have more money.

I keep coming back to the same question: why will Jinba win against companies with 100x their resources that are building the same thing? "We use conversational AI instead of drag-and-drop" is a UX difference, not a moat. Every competitor will have conversational AI within 18 months — most already do. The answer would need to be something structural: a regulatory advantage, a data advantage, a distribution advantage, a network effect. On-prem deployment for regulated industries is the closest thing to structural, but it's a feature, not a business model. I respect the founders' credentials and their willingness to uproot from Japan to compete in the US market. But this feels like smart people doing exactly what I described in "Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas" — applying their considerable talent to a problem they identified through market analysis rather than personal necessity, in a category where the consensus has already formed.
