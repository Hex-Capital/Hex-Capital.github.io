# Doomersion -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice is that another YC company -- Parrot, from Fall 2025 -- is occupying almost exactly the same space: "TikTok for language learning" using comprehensible input methodology. When two companies in consecutive YC batches are building the same fundamental thing, that tells me this is becoming consensus, not contrarian. The whole reason I get excited about a deal is the feeling that nobody else sees what I see. Here, clearly a lot of people see it. The language learning app market is one of the most well-funded categories in consumer software, dominated by a $14 billion public company. Every VC in the world knows this space. That's the opposite environment where I find my best investments. The best companies I've backed -- SpaceX when private space was laughable, Crusoe when burning gas for Bitcoin seemed deranged -- were companies where I was one of very few people who believed. Doomersion is a smart product insight in a crowded, visible market. That's a different kind of bet than the one I make.

Mostafa Afr is clearly talented, and I respect what he's built. Self-teaching Japanese over six years and becoming the top-upvoted resource on r/LearnJapanese -- that's real domain experience, not just market analysis. The fact that he built Langmates.ai before this tells me language learning is genuinely in his bones. And the Healing Helpers nonprofit, providing translation services to 900+ refugees in Phoenix, is the kind of detail that catches my attention -- it tells me he understands that language barriers are real obstacles to economic participation, not just an inconvenience for tourists. That's the seed of something I'd care about. But when I listen for the story underneath the story -- the adversity that forges someone into the kind of founder who will persist through the absolute worst moments -- what I hear is a high-achieving Penn M&T student who's passionate and capable. That's not the same as someone who's been through the fire. I'd want to sit across from him and hear what he doesn't put on his profile page.

The strongest bull case here is the traction: 15,000 downloads in two weeks and power users spending three-plus hours a day. That engagement number is striking -- if real, it suggests the product has found something genuinely addictive. The "why now" is also legitimate: Gen-Z doomscrolling behavior creates a behavioral substrate that didn't exist five years ago, and LLMs now make automated content-to-proficiency matching technically feasible at low cost. If the matching algorithm gets good enough and the user base grows, there's a data moat forming around what content drives learning outcomes at each proficiency level. I can see the version of this story where Doomersion becomes the default way young people acquire languages, and Duolingo can't respond because pivoting to third-party video feeds would cannibalize their entire streak-based engagement model. That's a real structural advantage.

But I keep coming back to what's missing for me. This company doesn't make an invisible system visible. It doesn't create economic access for people who lack it -- at least not in its current form as a consumer app targeting Gen-Z scrollers. The refugee translation angle in Mostafa's background is actually closer to the kind of problem I'd want to fund, but the company isn't built around that. The content dependency on TikTok-style platforms introduces fragility rather than the kind of regulatory moat I typically find attractive -- and with the ongoing TikTok proceedings in the U.S., that fragility is acute. The monetization path is entirely unproven, with no visible pricing or subscription structure. And the team composition is opaque: four people, but only one name. After HQ Trivia taught me that team dynamics are everything, investing into a structure where I can't even see who the other three people are would make me deeply uncomfortable.

This is a well-conceived product by a capable young founder in a large, growing market. For a lot of investors, that's enough. But I'm not most investors. I'm looking for the thing that makes me uncomfortable in a good way -- the company that sounds ridiculous until you realize the founder has seen something nobody else has. Doomersion sounds sensible. That's not a compliment in my framework.
