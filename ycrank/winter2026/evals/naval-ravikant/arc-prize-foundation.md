# ARC Prize Foundation -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

François Chollet didn't study AGI measurement. He invented it. The "On the Measure of Intelligence" paper, the original ARC benchmark, Keras with 63.8K GitHub stars and 2M+ users -- this is a decade of obsessive work at the intersection where deep learning practice meets intelligence theory. You cannot hire for this. You cannot train someone into it. Chollet's understanding of what constitutes genuine reasoning versus pattern memorization is the kind of knowledge that emerges only from building the tools that power modern deep learning and then asking the harder question: *what are these tools actually doing?* Pair that with Mike Knoop, who co-founded Zapier and scaled it to $5B while leading AI R&D, and Greg Kamradt, whose "Needle in a Haystack" context retrieval test became a de facto industry standard -- this is a team where each founder independently created evaluation infrastructure that the AI community adopted voluntarily. That almost never happens. The founder-problem authenticity here is among the strongest I've encountered: the founders didn't find this problem, the problem is an extension of who they already are.

But I invest my own money. And the structural reality is that ARC Prize Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with no earned revenue, no equity, and no path to financial return. My entire framework rests on ownership -- "you're not going to get rich renting out your time, you must own equity." There is no equity here. The benchmark creates extraordinary leverage for the AI ecosystem: one evaluation framework shapes how billions of R&D dollars are directed, four frontier labs voluntarily report ARC-AGI scores in their model cards, and the competition has drawn nearly 3,000 teams across two years. That's genuine platform-layer influence. But the leverage flows entirely to the commons. An angel check into a nonprofit is a donation, not an investment. The organizational structure eliminates the asymmetric upside that makes angel investing rational.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. ARC Prize is becoming the trusted measurement infrastructure for the most consequential technology transition in human history. If governments formalize AGI evaluation requirements -- and the EU AI Act and U.S. AI Safety Institute activity suggest they will -- independent benchmark providers become critical infrastructure. There's a world where ARC Prize Foundation spawns a for-profit entity for enterprise evaluation services, licensed benchmark access, or regulatory compliance tools, the way Mozilla Foundation spawned Mozilla Corporation. Knoop has the product and business instincts to architect that. The competitive positioning is also favorable: Scale AI's SEAL benchmarks carry commercial conflicts of interest that an independent nonprofit doesn't. If credibility is the scarce resource in AI evaluation, ARC Prize has a structural advantage. Were this a for-profit company with the same team and the same adoption trajectory, I'd be writing a check immediately.

The timing is more consensus than contrarian. Everyone agrees we need better AI benchmarks. The specific intellectual thesis -- that LLMs are memorizing rather than reasoning, and that "skill acquisition efficiency" is the right measure of intelligence -- carries genuine contrarian weight within the research community. But the *organizational* thesis -- "independent AI evaluation is important" -- is mainstream. Scale AI raised $15.9B. METR catalyzed $38M through the Audacious Project. Epoch AI raised $10M+. This is a crowded category of well-funded efforts, even if ARC Prize's specific approach is differentiated. The competitive moat relies on Chollet's authorship and community adoption rather than on technology that compounds in a proprietary way. Benchmark design is not technically irreplicable -- the moat is social and reputational.

The integrity signals are strong and genuine. Choosing nonprofit over for-profit when you could easily raise venture capital is a costly signal of long-term orientation. Chollet walking away from Google to pursue this full-time, the independent academic panel from UCLA, NYU, Santa Fe Institute, and Columbia -- these founders are building for the mission, not for an exit. That's exactly the kind of person I want to work with for a decade. But the financial structure means "working together" looks like philanthropy, not investment. I respect what they're building. I'd donate to it. I won't angel invest in it, because there's nothing to invest in.
