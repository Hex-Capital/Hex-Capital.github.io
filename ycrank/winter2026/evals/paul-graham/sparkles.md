# Sparkles -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Sparkles is the competitive landscape, and it's sobering. Lovable is at $200M ARR with $530M raised. Cursor is at $1B+ ARR with $3.4B raised. Replit just raised at $3B. And the positioning here -- "Lovable for existing projects" -- is essentially a feature gap in those companies' roadmaps. That phrase tells me something: the idea was found by studying the market map, not by living with a problem. When you describe your company in relation to another company's limitation, you're advertising that your moat is their prioritization decision. The moment Lovable adds GitHub import -- and their blog already discusses it -- this positioning evaporates. Claude Code's GitHub Actions integration already lets non-technical users trigger AI-generated PRs from issue comments. The gap Sparkles occupies is real today but structurally temporary.

How did this founder find this problem? Dan Bekirov is a 20-year-old developer who worked at Structured AI, interned at Iterate.com, and served as a Cursor Ambassador. He was embedded in the AI coding tool ecosystem. That's domain proximity, not organic discovery. There's no story of a specific moment where a marketing colleague Slacked him at 2 AM needing a button color changed and he thought "this is insane." The problem itself -- non-technical teammates bottlenecked on trivial front-end changes -- is genuine. Every engineer has felt this. But the dossier reads like someone who surveyed the competitive landscape, identified the white space between Lovable (greenfield only) and Cursor (developers only), and built into the gap. That's the approach I've warned about in "How to Get Startup Ideas" -- finding opportunities by looking at what other companies don't do rather than by noticing what's broken in your own life. The schlep of safely editing production codebases is real -- sandboxing, permissions, enterprise workflows -- but it's technical complexity, not the kind of deep regulatory or logistical pain that deters competitors for years. Stripe's schlep was dealing with banks and money transmission licenses. This schlep is something a funded team of five could replicate in a quarter.

The solo founder question is central. I've been clear about this: cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. Yes, I made an exception for Drew Houston -- but Houston had built an extraordinary technical prototype and the problem had grown so organically from his own life that the founder-problem bond was undeniable. Here, a 20-year-old solo founder is targeting enterprise sales to VPs of Operations and Marketing. Enterprise sales cycles are long, relationship-intensive, and require someone selling while someone else builds. A one-person team cannot do both, and the YC page shows is_hiring as false. The angels from xAI, a16z, OpenAI, Cloudflare, and General Catalyst are a positive signal about Dan's ability to attract interest, but angel names don't write code or close enterprise deals.

The strongest bull case: the timing is perfect, the problem is universal, and this kid is actually technical -- he built the product himself, which puts him ahead of most solo founders I see. If the "vibe coding" wave continues expanding and existing-codebase editing becomes a distinct category rather than a feature, Sparkles could establish itself before the incumbents pivot. The switching costs from configured environments and enterprise rulesets could compound. And the fact that Jared Friedman is his YC partner means someone sharp believes in this. If Dan finds a co-founder in the next three months and lands two or three enterprise pilots, this becomes a different company. But that's a lot of "ifs" -- and I've learned that when my investment thesis requires the founder to do three things they haven't done yet (find a co-founder, close enterprise deals, outrun incumbents), I'm not investing in what exists but in what I hope will exist.

What I don't see is evidence that anyone wants this yet. No user counts. No revenue. No customer logos. No organic sharing signals. A hundred sixty YC launch upvotes and 220 Twitter followers -- that's launch-day noise, not pull. At pre-seed I don't demand traction, but I look for any signal that someone found this product and couldn't stop using it. That signal is absent. The freemium pricing is live, which means the product exists, but existence is not demand.

Dan Bekirov is clearly smart and technically capable. Getting into YC as a solo 20-year-old founder is not nothing. But smart and technically capable is the starting line, not the finish. The idea feels manufactured from a gap in the competitive landscape rather than discovered through lived frustration. The moat is thin. The competitive threats are massive and proximate. And the solo founder structure is fundamentally mismatched with the enterprise GTM strategy. I'd want to see Dan find a co-founder, demonstrate organic user pull from at least a handful of teams who genuinely depend on the product, and show that the existing-codebase editing niche is defensible before putting my own money in.
