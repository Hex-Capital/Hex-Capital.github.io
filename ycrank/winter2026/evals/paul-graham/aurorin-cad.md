# Aurorin CAD -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Building a CAD kernel from scratch might be the purest example of schlep blindness I've seen in years. Every mechanical engineer on earth knows that SolidWorks takes four hours to open a file. Every programmer who's glanced at the underlying geometry engines knows they were built in the 1980s and never fundamentally rebuilt. The problem has been sitting in plain sight for decades. But nobody attempts a ground-up replacement because the work is staggeringly tedious — computational geometry, NURBS surface math, constraint solvers, boolean operations on solid bodies. It's years of grinding through the ugliest kind of math before you have anything to show. This is exactly the dynamic I wrote about with Stripe: thousands of hackers knew payment processing was broken, but the schlep of dealing with banks and regulatory compliance caused their unconscious minds to look the other way. The CAD kernel schlep is, if anything, harder.

What makes Michael Baron's background interesting is that he didn't just notice this market — he appears to have been forged at the exact intersection where this problem lives. Three SpaceX internships working on propulsion simulation and flight software means he used engineering tools under extreme performance demands. An Apple internship optimizing GPU drivers means he understands at the metal level what modern hardware can actually do. And then he spent four years — from 2018 to 2022 — building a multi-GPU graphics engine that rendered terrain at hundreds of frames per second across multiple monitors. That's not a weekend project. That's someone who spent years developing the precise technical intuition needed to recognize the gap between what today's GPUs can deliver and what 1980s-era CAD kernels actually use. I don't think this is a manufactured idea. I think this is someone who lived inside both worlds — high-performance graphics and engineering simulation — until the obvious inadequacy of existing tools became unbearable.

The technical founder signal here is the strongest dimension by far. Baron is the archetype of the hacker who builds the core product himself. He didn't hire engineers to build the kernel; he built it. He didn't license Parasolid or ACIS; he wrote his own. The working desktop app for Mac and Windows exists today. This is the kind of founder I would describe as "an animal" in the specific sense I mean — someone who stays up all night because the code itself is the thing they care about. The SpaceX-to-Apple-to-custom-engine pipeline demonstrates sustained intensity over nearly a decade.

Here is my problem: this is a solo founder building what historically required teams of dozens. When Drew Houston came to us as a solo founder, I didn't reject him — I made finding a co-founder a condition. Houston had a working prototype and an organically discovered problem, which is what made the condition reasonable instead of disqualifying. Baron has similar elements: a working product and a plausibly organic origin story. But a CAD kernel is broader in surface area than file sync was. You need computational geometry expertise, professional-grade UI for demanding users, file format import/export for decades of legacy designs, AI integration, go-to-market in enterprise software, and eventually compliance with industry certification standards. One person cannot sustain excellence across all of these simultaneously. The solo founder concern here isn't abstract — it's structural.

The other gap that keeps me from writing a check today is the total absence of user pull. The product is downloadable. Presumably engineers can try it. But there's no evidence that anyone has tried it and been excited. No beta users singing its praises, no waitlist growing organically, no engineer on Twitter saying "I just tried Aurorin and it actually works." Thirty-five YC Launch upvotes and 148 Twitter followers is essentially noise. At pre-seed I don't demand traction, but I want some signal that the thing works for real users doing real work — even five engineers who would be genuinely upset if it disappeared. That signal is absent.

The bull case is compelling enough to state clearly: if Baron has actually built a functioning parametric CAD kernel with B-Rep support that's dramatically faster than SolidWorks, the moat is enormous. Nobody else in the AI-CAD startup cohort — not Zoo, not Adam, not Hestus — has built their own kernel from scratch. They're wrapping existing engines or plugging into incumbents. A custom kernel that's AI-native from the ground up, built by someone with GPU-driver-level optimization expertise, could be the foundation of the next generation of engineering software. The incumbents can't rebuild their kernels without breaking backward compatibility with millions of existing designs. The market is $12 billion and growing. If Baron finds a strong co-founder, demonstrates that real engineers can do real work in this tool, and shows even modest organic growth, this becomes a very different conversation. The frighteningly ambitious quality of the idea — replacing SolidWorks from scratch — is precisely what suppresses competition from other startups and creates structural opportunity. That's the same dynamic I saw in Boom, though Baron needs to prove the product works for professional workflows, not just demos.

Today, the schlep is real, the founder's technical credentials are exceptional, and the organic origin is plausible. But the solo founder structure, the complete absence of user evidence, and the gap between "parts in seconds" demo claims and verified professional-grade capability keep me on the edge. I'd want to sit down with Baron, see the product, and understand his co-founder plan before committing my own money.
