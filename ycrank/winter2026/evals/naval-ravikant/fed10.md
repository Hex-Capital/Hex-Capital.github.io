# Fed10 -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The founding story here is genuinely interesting. Three best friends who lobbied together in the Nevada legislature, passed actual bills before one of them could legally vote, then reconvened to build the AI replacement for what they'd been doing by hand. Armand as the youngest governor appointee in Nevada, drafting recommendations that became law -- that's not a credential you acquire through career optimization. That's a kid who was obsessed with how legislation actually moves. The question I keep returning to, though, is whether this is non-transferable knowledge or operational familiarity. There's a difference between understanding the deep structure of a domain -- the way Evan Williams understood public communication as a medium -- and understanding the workflow of a domain. These founders know what a policy brief looks like, what clients need, how bills die in committee. That knowledge is real. But it's also possessed by every experienced lobbyist and government affairs director in Washington. It's specific, but it's not rare enough to constitute a durable intellectual moat.

The leverage architecture here concerns me structurally. Fed10 is borrowing leverage from foundation model providers and applying it to legislative text. The AI does the analysis, but the AI isn't theirs -- it's OpenAI's or Anthropic's, wrapped in domain-specific prompting and workflow tooling. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question and answer made the knowledge graph more valuable and harder to replicate. Or Alchemy, where developer adoption created infrastructure lock-in at the protocol layer. Fed10's leverage is real -- one AI agent replacing a $500/hr consultant is genuine cost arbitrage -- but it's the same leverage story that every "AI replaces professional services" company tells in 2026. The platform doesn't become more powerful as more customers use it in any obvious way. Customer-specific policy models could create switching costs over time, but that's standard SaaS stickiness dressed up as a network effect.

The timing is where this breaks down for me. "AI agents replace expensive consultants" is not a contrarian thesis. It's the defining consensus of this era. Every YC batch has fifteen companies doing exactly this across different professional services verticals. USLege raised $2.7M for a nearly identical approach nine months before Fed10's batch. FiscalNote and Quorum are both layering AI capabilities onto their existing platforms. Plural Policy got acquired specifically for its AI regulatory intelligence. When the incumbents, the new entrants, and the acquirers all agree that this is the direction, the pricing of the opportunity already reflects optimism. The real money gets made when you're positioned against the crowd, not with it. I invested in Uber when ride-sharing was illegal and most smart people thought the legal risks were disqualifying. I don't see an equivalent non-consensus angle here.

Let me steelman the bull case, because the market fundamentals are real. $5.24B in federal lobbying spend, growing almost $800M year-over-year. FiscalNote at $120M revenue proves enterprise willingness to pay for legislative intelligence. The incumbents have a genuine innovator's dilemma -- they sell human analyst overlays as upsells, which means AI-delivered analysis cannibalizes their highest-margin revenue stream. A hungry, domain-expert founding team that nails output quality could capture meaningful share precisely because FiscalNote and Quorum are structurally incentivized to move slowly. If the trio's hands-on legislative experience translates into measurably better AI output evaluation and training -- if they can make the analysis 90% as reliable as a human consultant -- the unit economics flip dramatically and adoption follows. The CRM and workflow layer creates stickiness that a pure analysis tool wouldn't have.

But even granting all of that, I'm looking at an application-layer company in a consensus category with replicable technology and borrowed leverage. The founding team has real domain experience but not the kind of singular, non-transferable insight that produces asymmetric returns. The technology -- LLMs parsing public legislative text -- does not compound in any structural way. Any well-funded team with legislative domain hires and access to GPT-5 can produce equivalent output within twelve months. The dossier itself states the commoditization risk plainly. I want companies where the founder's knowledge creates a gap that widens over time, where the technology gets harder to replicate with each iteration, where the consensus is wrong about something fundamental. Fed10 is a competent team executing a consensus playbook. That produces 2x-3x outcomes, not the 1000x asymmetry I structure my portfolio around.
