# EigenPal -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about EigenPal is that this is a consensus idea. "Use LLMs to process enterprise documents without templates" is the kind of thing you'd arrive at by reading about AI capabilities and scanning for large addressable markets. I don't see evidence that either founder was personally drowning in badly scanned invoices or handwritten KYC forms. Blaszyk comes from search infrastructure at Elastic and Yelp. Novak was running a mobile app revenue optimization company. These are smart engineers who noticed a technology shift and aimed it at a big market. That's not the worst origin story -- it beats a brainstorming session over coffee -- but it's not organic discovery either. When I ask "would these founders have built this product if they weren't trying to start a startup?" I suspect the answer is no. Compare that to Drew Houston, who built Dropbox because he kept forgetting his USB drive. The problem found him. Here, the founders found the problem.

The IDP market is also exactly the kind of category I get nervous about. Hyperscience has raised $439 million. Rossum did $44.9 million in revenue last year. ABBYY is the entrenched incumbent with 60% new ARR growth. Docsumo is already at $10.3 million revenue. And those are just the named competitors -- every team with access to GPT-4V or Claude Vision can build basic document extraction now. The dossier itself identifies the core risk plainly: "The template-free LLM approach that differentiates EigenPal today may become table stakes within 12-18 months." When everyone can see the same opportunity at the same time, the upside gets priced in fast. The schlep here -- compliance certifications, on-prem deployment, accuracy guarantees -- is real, but it's not hidden. Every IDP vendor already knows about these requirements. That's effort, not insight.

The strongest signal in EigenPal's favor is the enterprise traction. Two large European banks working on loan automation at pre-seed stage is not nothing. Getting SOC II Type 2 certified this early shows the founders understand what enterprise buyers actually require -- that's a form of doing things that don't scale, investing months in compliance work before you have revenue to justify it. And the open-source DOCX editor with 396 GitHub stars shows Blaszyk has genuine hacker instincts. He builds things and ships them publicly. These are not poseurs.

The bull case would look like this: legacy IDP vendors face a classic innovator's dilemma. ABBYY and Kofax built their businesses on per-template licensing. Switching to template-free LLM processing would cannibalize their core revenue model -- the same dynamic that killed Kodak's film business when digital cameras arrived. If EigenPal can lock in enterprise customers during the transition window, those relationships become sticky through compliance requirements and workflow dependencies. Novak's experience as a 3-time B2B AI founder who raised a $4M Series A for Assetario means he's navigated enterprise sales cycles before. If both founders are fully committed, the combination of Blaszyk's infrastructure engineering and Novak's enterprise go-to-market could work. The timing window is genuinely real -- LLM vision capabilities crossed a production threshold in 2023-2024 that makes template-free processing reliable for the first time.

But I keep coming back to two problems. First, the co-founder commitment question. Novak is listed as CEO of Assetario from 2020 to present. That's a company that raised $4 million. Is it wound down? Is he splitting attention? The dossier flags this as unknown. Co-founders are for a startup what location is for real estate, and a co-founder who might be running another company simultaneously undermines the whole foundation. Second, this market doesn't have the structural protection that schlep blindness provides. When Stripe tackled payments, the banking and regulatory complexity was so painful that even programmers who understood the problem perfectly couldn't bring themselves to start. Document processing doesn't have that quality. The schlep is moderate and widely understood. That means competition will be continuous and well-funded.

Blaszyk is a real builder, and the team has legitimate enterprise credentials. But the idea feels like it emerged from a capability scan -- "LLMs can now read messy documents, therefore we should build an IDP platform" -- rather than from years of frustration with a specific broken workflow. The market is large and growing, which is exactly why it attracts capital from every direction. I don't see the moat that would let a pre-seed team outrun incumbents with hundreds of millions in funding and existing customer relationships. This might work out -- enterprise software transitions do create openings for fast-moving newcomers -- but it's not the kind of bet where the problem itself provides structural protection.
