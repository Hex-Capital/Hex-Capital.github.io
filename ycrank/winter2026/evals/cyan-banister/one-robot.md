# One Robot -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about One Robot is that this isn't a contrarian bet -- it's a consensus one. World models for robotics is one of the hottest categories in AI right now. NVIDIA launched Cosmos in January 2025 with 20 million hours of training data. Runway raised $315 million and built GWM Robotics. 1X published their own world model. Google DeepMind and Meta are developing similar capabilities internally. When I see a space where every major tech company and well-funded startup is converging simultaneously, my instinct is to walk the other way. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- were companies that other investors actively didn't want to fund. Nobody was racing to build competing gas-flare Bitcoin mining platforms when we backed Crusoe. Nobody was lining up to fund male contraceptive gel when I championed Contraline through Founders Fund. One Robot is entering a space where the race is already crowded, and the biggest player in the room is giving their product away for free.

When I try to apply my usual starting question -- tell me your story, not the business -- the dossier gives me strong credentials but no survival narrative. Hemanth earned a 4.0 at Georgia Tech, received a NASA Early Career Achievement Medal, worked at Google and McLaren, and bootstrapped Crescer AI to profitability. Elton spent five years at Tesla building factory automation and Dojo infrastructure, then led software at Industrial Next. These are impressive resumes. But I'm not hearing the story of how someone ended up so obsessed with deformable object manipulation that they couldn't do anything else. I'm not hearing about the personal experience that makes this founder uniquely forged for this particular fight. When I backed Uber, it wasn't because Travis had a great resume -- it was because I could feel his gravitas, his almost primal need to disrupt an industry he saw as fundamentally broken. Hemanth's Balashree Honour, selected from 200,000 children across India, hints at a remarkable origin story I'd love to hear, and bootstrapping a company to profitability shows real entrepreneurial toughness. But based on what I can see, these founders chose this problem through professional pattern recognition rather than personal necessity -- and at the earliest stages, that distinction matters deeply to me.

The bull case here is real, and I want to be honest about it. If world models become the standard training paradigm for VLA-based manipulation -- which seems increasingly likely -- then the team that owns task-specific simulation for deformable objects could build a genuine data flywheel that's hard to replicate. Textiles, flexible packaging, soft assembly -- these are contact-rich domains where rigid-body simulators genuinely fail, and where NVIDIA's horizontal platform may never specialize deeply enough. The founders' shared experience at Industrial Next, a YC-backed robotics manufacturing company, gives them direct exposure to the exact bottleneck they're solving. They've seen firsthand how slow and expensive physical robot data collection is for manipulation tasks. And Hemanth's combination of ML research depth with hands-on robotics experience, plus a proven ability to build a profitable company from nothing, is genuinely rare. If this niche proves defensible -- if task-specific deformable-object simulation is truly a distinct problem from general world modeling -- then One Robot could become the picks-and-shovels play for an entire category of robotic manipulation. That's an infrastructure bet at a genuine inflection point, which is a pattern I've invested in before.

But I keep coming back to the competitive landscape. NVIDIA's Cosmos has 20 million hours of training data and is free. Runway has $860 million in funding. These aren't future threats -- they're present realities. One Robot's defense is specialization in a niche, but niches have a way of getting absorbed when the platforms mature. I also don't see the economic access dimension that draws me to my strongest investments. Uber created income for drivers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people who couldn't get it. Postmates connected delivery workers with earning opportunities. One Robot makes robotics R&D teams more efficient -- that's valuable, but it doesn't create pathways for people who currently lack access. It's an optimization play for well-funded teams, not a tool that opens doors for people on the outside.

The co-founder dynamic is the one area where I feel genuinely good about this company. Both founders worked together at Industrial Next, which means they've already navigated a startup together -- the uncertainty, the disagreements, the hard calls. After HQ Trivia taught me that even the perfect product fails when co-founders can't resolve conflict, I always want to see evidence of a tested partnership. This one qualifies. A two-person team with a confirmed prior working relationship in the same domain is a solid foundation.

Ultimately, One Robot is a competent team with relevant experience building in a crowded, consensus space without a clear economic access story or the kind of biographical urgency that anchors my strongest investments. I can see the path where this works -- the niche holds, the data flywheel compounds, the big players stay horizontal while One Robot goes deep -- but it doesn't produce that jolt of intuitive energy I've learned to trust. It looks like a good bet to many investors, and that itself is the signal that tells me this isn't my kind of bet.
