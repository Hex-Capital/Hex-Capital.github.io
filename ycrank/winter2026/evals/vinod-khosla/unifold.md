# Unifold -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a team that has done something I see constantly and almost always pass on: three people who worked together inside an incumbent, identified a feature they think should be unbundled, and left to build exactly that feature as a standalone company. All three founders converge at MoonPay. Timothy Chung built Streambird and sold it *to* MoonPay. Quang Huynh spent two and a half years there. Hau Chu was a senior blockchain engineer there. Now they are building deposit orchestration infrastructure that sits adjacent to what MoonPay already offers. This is the definition of industry insiders executing the industry's playbook. They know what works, they know what doesn't -- and that's precisely the problem. They know what the industry considers impossible, which constrains what they will attempt.

Let me start where I always start: if Unifold succeeds completely -- becomes the dominant deposit orchestration layer for every on-chain application -- what changes in the world? Applications integrate crypto deposits faster. Developers save a few weeks of engineering time per integration. Users experience smoother cross-chain transactions. And that's it. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. No physical reality transforms. The crypto payment gateways market is worth roughly $1.7 billion today, growing to maybe $6 billion by 2035. Even capturing a dominant share of that, you've built a respectable middleware company. The team has done exactly what I warn about: they've reduced every conceivable risk -- they know the technology, they know the customers, they know the competitive landscape -- to the point where the consequences of success are thoroughly manageable. A nice business. Not a transformation.

The bull case deserves serious examination. Stablecoin transaction flows reached $2.9 trillion in 2025 and could reach $56 trillion by 2030. If stablecoins genuinely become the rails underneath global payments, the deposit orchestration layer becomes critical infrastructure for a financial system migration. In that world, Unifold could capture enormous throughput. The team's insider knowledge becomes an asset: Chung has already built and exited wallet infrastructure, Huynh brings fifteen years of operational depth, and Chu engineered at Solana Labs before MoonPay. Multi-chain fragmentation is accelerating with new L2s, which deepens the problem Unifold solves. This team might be the most qualified three people on the planet to build this specific product. But being the most qualified to execute an obvious idea in a crowded market is not the same as pursuing something worth pursuing. Stripe did not become Stripe because payments processing was a novel concept -- Stripe became Stripe because the internet itself was transforming commerce, and the Collisons saw a developer experience gap nobody else was attacking in 2010. Unifold is arriving in 2026 to a market where Glide has $15 million, a two-and-a-half-year head start, and a CEO who built the Robinhood Wallet. That's not skating to where the puck will be. That's skating to where everyone is already standing.

The technology itself raises a flag I cannot ignore. The dossier states plainly that "the core technical components -- multi-chain address generation, transaction routing, gas abstraction -- are implementable by well-resourced teams." There is no proprietary dataset, no patent, no network effect. The differentiation claimed -- compliance integrations with centralized exchanges and gas sponsorship -- are features, not moats. Features get replicated in months. When I backed Juniper against Cisco, Pradeep Sindhu had a fundamentally different architectural approach to routing that Cisco's entire engineering organization was structurally incapable of replicating quickly. The architecture itself was the disruption. I do not see an architectural disruption here. I see a cleaner API on top of commodity infrastructure.

What strikes me most is the gap between this team's capability and the ambition of the problem they chose. These founders have real talent -- a prior exit, deep multi-chain engineering skill, operational experience at scale. They are too capable for the size of problem they are attacking. A better developer SDK for crypto deposits is a feature inside Fireblocks, a module inside MoonPay, a product Glide already shipped. It is not a category. I would tell these founders: you have the engineering depth to build something genuinely difficult, something the industry says cannot be done. Go find that problem. Build programmable compliance infrastructure that makes regulators and crypto native-compatible in a way nobody has solved. Build cross-chain settlement that eliminates bridges entirely at the protocol level. Pick a fight with an incumbent that matters. Do not build a slightly better on-ramp when the people who taught you how on-ramps work are your direct competitors with a billion dollars in the bank.
