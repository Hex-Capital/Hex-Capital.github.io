# Veriad -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most telling fact about Veriad is that a company called Red Marker built essentially the same product starting in 2013 and was acquired by IntelligenceBank last July. IntelligenceBank now has $39M raised, $11.5M in revenue, and 400 customers doing marketing compliance with AI. Blee, a YC S22 company, has been doing this for two years in financial services. Sedric AI has $22M for adjacent compliance automation. When I invested in Juniper, Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router -- that dismissal was the signal. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry thought plant-based meat was a joke. Here, nobody is laughing. Nobody is dismissing the approach. The category is validated, the incumbents are already there, and a competitor was acquired for it. When the established players endorse what you're doing by acquiring your predecessors, it means the innovation isn't threatening enough to resist. That's not where I find transformational returns.

Let me start with my first question: if Veriad succeeds completely -- becomes the dominant AI compliance platform for marketing -- what actually changes in the world? Marketing teams at enterprises review their creative assets in 20 seconds instead of days. Campaigns launch sooner. Compliance headcount shrinks. That is useful. It is a real business. But the advertising industry still works the same way. The regulatory system is unchanged. Content is still created, reviewed, and published -- the only difference is that a machine checks the boxes instead of a human. The "$100B wasted on ineffective ads" figure on their YC page is a marketing claim, not an industry being disrupted. The actual AI compliance monitoring market is $1.8 billion growing to $5.2 billion. That is a nice market for a SaaS company. It is not a system being made obsolete. The consequence of full success here is a solid enterprise software business, perhaps worth a few hundred million dollars at peak. That outcome does not justify the effort of the most ambitious founders I could be backing.

The founders themselves are competent and well-matched for this exact problem -- that's actually part of why this doesn't excite me. Rohan built AI products at CoLoop, shipped SaaS to Fortune 500 companies, and understands the compliance workflow. Anton closed seven-figure deals at some of the world's largest enterprises. They previously built and sold internal compliance tools to Fortune 500 companies. They know this space. They have the relationships. They are insiders executing the insider playbook with precision. And that is precisely the pattern I've learned to avoid. People with established market experience aim for predictable, achievable outcomes. They know what the market will buy, so they build it. They've reduced their probability of failure admirably -- and in doing so, they've constrained the consequence of success to something entirely manageable.

The strongest bull case I can construct: AI-generated content is exploding, regulatory enforcement is intensifying globally, and the compliance bottleneck is becoming genuinely painful for enterprises spending $50M+ on advertising. Veriad's team has the enterprise sales muscle to close large contracts, the technical capability to build a reliable product, and the timing benefit of LLMs finally being good enough to parse regulatory text accurately. If they execute with the discipline their backgrounds suggest, they could build a $50-100M ARR business in a growing market. That is a real outcome. For many investors, that is an attractive bet -- a known market, a capable team, a proven category. I am not that investor. I look at the core technology -- applying LLMs to check content against regulatory text -- and the dossier itself tells me this is "technically reproducible by any team with access to frontier language models." There is no deep technology moat here. The defensibility comes from accumulated compliance rule sets and enterprise switching costs, which are real but incremental. This is a feature that Adobe or Salesforce could ship in a quarter if they decided marketing compliance was strategic.

I would tell Rohan and Anton: you clearly understand enterprise software and compliance. You have the skills to build something bigger. Go find a problem where success means an entire industry operates differently, where the experts tell you it cannot be done, where the magnitude of what changes if you're right justifies the risk of total failure. Marketing compliance review is a fine business. It is not a problem too important not to work on.
