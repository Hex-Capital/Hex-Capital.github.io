# Proximitty -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company building better collections software for banks. The team is solid, the market is real, the technology works, and well-funded competitors are already there. I can see the spreadsheet -- $9 billion TAM, 16.7% CAGR, clear enterprise ROI from replacing expensive human agents with AI. And that is precisely why I stop evaluating. If Proximitty succeeds beyond anyone's expectations -- if every bank and credit union on the planet adopts their platform -- the world gets slightly more efficient debt collection. Borrowers get contacted through better channels. Collections rates go up. Compliance violations go down. It is a perfectly fine business outcome. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No industry becomes structurally obsolete. The lending system continues to work exactly as it does today, just with fewer people doing the repetitive parts. They have optimized their way into a manageable outcome.

The competitive landscape tells the story. Prodigal, a YC-backed company with $14.2 million in funding, launched proAgent in 2025 -- an AI agent for consumer finance that directly overlaps with Proximitty's core offering. LoanPro has $100 million and $24.3 million in revenue building the same lending infrastructure from the API-first direction. Sedric AI raised $22 million for compliance monitoring. When I backed Juniper to challenge Cisco, the CTO of Cisco publicly said they would never build a TCP/IP router. When I backed Impossible Foods, the food industry said plant-based meat was a joke. Where are the dismissals here? Nobody is laughing at AI collections agents. Everyone is building them. The experts validate the approach, which in my experience means the innovation is incremental enough to be non-threatening to the existing order. If the incumbents see you coming and are not worried, you are not disrupting them.

The strongest counterargument deserves serious attention. The CTO's open-source work on ACI.dev -- 4,700 GitHub stars on a tool-calling platform integrating 600+ tools for AI agents -- is a genuine technical signal. That is not a resume bullet; it is demonstrated ability to build the exact kind of agent orchestration infrastructure Proximitty needs. Combined with five years of security infrastructure at Bloomberg, Zhang understands both the plumbing and the compliance constraints of financial systems. The CEO brings McKinsey analytical rigor and growth experience at Taptap Send, a regulated remittance company -- relevant domain knowledge for navigating enterprise sales in financial services. If any two-person team can execute across this technical surface area, this pairing is credible. And the timing argument is real: voice AI crossed the production-quality threshold for regulated conversations in the last eighteen months, BNPL portfolio growth is flooding collections pipelines with volume that manual workforces cannot absorb, and browser-automation capabilities in AI models only emerged in 2024-2025. The convergence of these trends creates a genuine window.

But here is what I notice that a market-sizing analyst would miss: the founders' ambition is calibrated to the scale of enterprise SaaS, not to the scale of the problem. The framing is "autonomous loan servicing and collections" -- a feature description, not a vision for transforming how credit works in society. A founder who said "we are making human debt collectors obsolete and fundamentally restructuring the relationship between lenders and borrowers" would at least be aiming at a consequence worth pursuing. Instead, the positioning is a better tool for existing institutions doing existing things. The no-code browser automation converting screen recordings into workflows is clever engineering, but it is a productivity feature for operations teams, not a technology that makes the incumbent approach uneconomic. Compare this to Square, which did not give existing merchants a better POS system -- it created access to payment processing for millions of merchants who had none. That is the difference between improving a system and replacing one.

The compliance angle could theoretically create a moat -- real-time monitoring across FDCPA, CFPB, TCPA, FCRA, SCRA, and state-level regulations is genuinely hard, and if Proximitty becomes the trusted compliance layer for AI-driven collections, switching costs would be substantial. But compliance moats are defensive, not offensive. They protect a position; they do not create a new category. And the claim of being "trusted by publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" with zero named customers and no independently verified metrics makes me cautious. I have seen enough startups describe pilot conversations as customer relationships to discount unverified trust claims entirely.

I pass. These are capable founders in a real market with reasonable timing. In a different framework, this might be an attractive bet. But I do not invest in making existing industries 20 percentage points more efficient. I invest in making existing industries irrelevant. Proximitty has reduced the probability of failure to the point where even their success scenario is a mid-scale SaaS company in a market where four competitors already have tens of millions in funding. The founders are too smart and too technically capable to spend their careers on a problem this contained.
