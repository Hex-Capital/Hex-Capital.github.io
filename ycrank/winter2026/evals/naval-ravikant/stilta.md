# Stilta -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything about the timing. Solve Intelligence has $55M raised and profitable 8-figure ARR. DeepIP hit 7-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics grew ARR 20x in six months with $21M behind it. That's over $90M in venture capital already deployed into AI patent tooling, with multiple companies demonstrating explosive growth. This is not a contrarian bet. This is a consensus market at peak enthusiasm. When four well-funded startups are all scaling in the same category, the efficient market has already priced in the thesis that AI will transform patent work. The question isn't whether the thesis is right -- it's whether there's any asymmetric upside left for a pre-seed entrant arriving after the land rush.

The specific knowledge problem is structural, not circumstantial. Four McKinsey and QuantumBlack alumni building AI tools for patent attorneys. QuantumBlack is McKinsey's AI division -- it literally trains people to deploy enterprise AI systems. That is the definition of teachable, transferable knowledge. Consulting firms produce hundreds of people per year with exactly this skill profile: take AI capabilities, apply them to an enterprise vertical, build workflow tooling. Oskar Block's prior ventures were in sports betting. Nobody on this team has spent years inside the patent system developing the kind of non-obvious understanding of claim construction, prosecution strategy, or prior art epistemology that would give them an edge a competitor couldn't replicate in six months. The founders identified this opportunity the way consultants identify opportunities -- by surveying a market and finding inefficiency. That's pattern recognition, not specific knowledge. Any QuantumBlack team could have landed on the same insight during a client engagement.

The "Cursor for patent attorneys" framing reveals the leverage gap. Cursor works because software developers already operate inside code -- the AI augments an existing substrate of infinite leverage. Patent attorneys don't have that substrate. They operate in a fundamentally human, judgment-intensive, liability-constrained domain where each client engagement requires bespoke analysis. The leverage ratio of serving one more patent attorney is not the leverage ratio of serving one more developer. This is per-seat B2B SaaS with direct sales to conservative law firms -- each customer needs to be convinced individually, each workflow needs customization, and trust must be earned through a long adoption cycle. There are no network effects, no protocol dynamics, no permissionless distribution. The business scales linearly with sales effort.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: that end-to-end workflow coverage is a durable advantage over specialized tools, that the McKinsey enterprise sales muscle gives Stilta a distribution edge with large firms, and that the competitors' head starts are offset by their narrower product scope. If Stilta could genuinely consolidate FTO analysis, monitoring, drafting, and strategy into a single workspace that replaces three or four point solutions, the switching cost moat would be real. And the team's consulting background might actually be the right background for selling to conservative enterprise buyers who trust McKinsey-style credibility. The relocation from Stockholm to San Francisco and the claim of being live with leading firms on both continents suggests execution velocity. But even this bull case runs into the arithmetic of a four-person team trying to build depth across multiple workflow verticals while competing against companies with ten times their capital and a year's head start in each individual workflow.

The technology doesn't compound in any distinctive way. The underlying LLMs are commodity. The auditability and traceability features are engineering work, not fundamental research -- any well-funded competitor can build source-backing and audit trails. There's no proprietary dataset, no visible knowledge graph, no physics-first innovation. The potential for data moats exists in theory -- accumulated patent analysis workflows and firm-specific training data -- but the competitors with larger user bases are accumulating that data faster. Solve Intelligence has been refining its models on real patent prosecution for years. Stilta is starting that flywheel from zero in a market where the leaders already have escape velocity.

This maps cleanly to my framework for passing on vertical SaaS: smart people, real market, no specific knowledge that can't be taught, no new form of leverage, and timing that is consensus rather than contrarian. The founders are capable -- the bootstrapping track record and the relocation demonstrate energy and execution -- but capability without specific knowledge in a hot market is a race you're unlikely to win. I need founders who know something about patent epistemology that surprises me, not founders who know how to deploy enterprise AI systems the way McKinsey taught them.
