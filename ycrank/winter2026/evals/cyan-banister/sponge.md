# Sponge -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what struck me immediately: five funded startups, three of the biggest payments companies on the planet, and Coinbase are all building the same thing at the same time. Visa launched Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard shipped Agent Pay. Stripe -- the founders' own former employer -- released an Agentic Commerce Suite in February 2026. When I look at a deal, the first filter after the founder's story is whether the company is unpopular and difficult to assess. Sponge is the opposite. Agent payments is possibly the hottest infrastructure category in fintech right now. The moment I see a market where every major incumbent and a half-dozen well-capitalized startups are converging simultaneously, I know the weirdness has been arbitraged out. This isn't a pocket of dreamers nobody's found yet -- it's a parade.

I wanted to understand who these founders are before the business, and the dossier gave me almost nothing to work with on that front. Three engineers from Stripe Crypto. Waterloo, UofT, UCSD. They built stablecoin financial accounts and money movement systems. That's impressive domain expertise -- genuinely, these people know this infrastructure cold. But when I ask "tell me your story," I'm not listening for a résumé. I'm listening for the moment that broke you open and made this problem yours. What was the experience that made autonomous agent payments feel like a personal mission rather than a market opportunity? I can't find it. The narrative reads like three talented engineers spotted a gap in their employer's product line and decided to fill it. That's a valid reason to start a company -- it's just not the kind of signal that activates my conviction. The founders who persist through the hardest moments are usually the ones who can't imagine doing anything else because the problem is woven into their biography. Here, the problem is woven into their LinkedIn.

Let me be fair about the bull case, because there is one. The fiat-plus-crypto hybrid approach is genuinely uncommon among competitors -- Coinbase AgentKit is crypto-only, Skyfire is crypto-native, and the Gateway product that lets businesses sell to agents by uploading an API spec is a clever wedge that nobody else seems to offer. If you believe the developer-to-agent infrastructure layer is structurally different from enterprise merchant checkout, these founders are precisely the right people to build it. They literally constructed the underlying systems at Stripe. And my SpaceX investment proves I can back infrastructure at inflection points. But here's the difference that matters: when I wrote that first check to SpaceX, private space was considered lunacy. Nobody else was doing it. The conviction required was enormous because consensus said Elon was crazy. Agent payments in 2026 requires no conviction at all -- consensus has already formed. Catena Labs raised $18 million. Payman AI raised nearly $14 million. The question isn't whether this market is real; it's whether Sponge can win a land grab against competitors with ten to thirty times their capital and against Stripe itself.

The thing I keep coming back to is what this company does to the world if it succeeds. When I backed Uber, the economic access story was immediate -- Roger, my driver, could earn a living on his own terms. Affirm made credit transparent for people who'd been exploited by hidden fees. Carta let employees understand what their equity was actually worth. These companies pulled invisible systems into the light. Sponge moves in the other direction -- it takes human financial decisions and makes them happen invisibly between machines. That's useful infrastructure, but it doesn't create economic access for anyone who lacks it. It doesn't make an opaque system transparent. It optimizes a flow that primarily serves developers and businesses who are already well-resourced. I can't find the positive-sum economic story that gets me excited.

The regulatory dimension is where I see genuine complexity, and that normally draws me in. Giving AI agents the ability to hold and spend money autonomously touches KYC/AML, money transmitter licensing, and liability frameworks that don't yet exist for non-human actors. That's the kind of hard space I'm comfortable in -- IronPort taught me that regulatory moats protect the companies willing to navigate them. But Sponge hasn't disclosed a regulatory strategy, while Catena Labs, founded by a Circle co-founder, has explicitly positioned itself as a regulated financial institution. If the regulatory moat is the competitive advantage in this space, the competitor with $18 million and a compliance-first strategy may already be building it. I'd want to understand how Sponge plans to handle licensing across jurisdictions before I'd feel confident about defensibility here. Three co-founders with shared Stripe experience is a reasonable starting point for team dynamics -- better than a random co-founder pairing, and three-way splits avoid the 50/50 deadlock that destroyed HQ Trivia. But I have no evidence of how they handle real disagreement, and the absence of any public-facing presence (no confirmed Twitter accounts, no LinkedIn company page) makes it harder to read their dynamic from the outside.
