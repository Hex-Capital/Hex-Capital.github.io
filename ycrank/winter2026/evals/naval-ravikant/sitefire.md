# sitefire -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the competitive landscape, because it tells me everything about timing. Peec AI has $29M and $4M+ ARR with 1,300 brands. Otterly.AI has 20,000 users bootstrapped. LLMrefs claims 10,000 marketers. Atyla serves 200+ teams. HubSpot shipped an AEO grader. This is not a contrarian bet -- this is a gold rush with a crowd already digging. When I invested in Uber at a $4M valuation, ride-sharing was illegal in most cities and smart people thought it was crazy. When I invested in Bitcoin in 2014, the consensus was "nerd money." The consensus on GEO in 2026 is that AI is transforming search and brands need new tools. That's not a secret -- that's a market research report projecting $7.3 billion by 2031. You don't get asymmetric returns betting on things everyone already believes.

Now the specific knowledge question. Jochen has a PhD in optimization and deep reinforcement learning applied to power grids. Vincent has CS from TUM and built things at a robotics company and a healthcare startup. They co-founded an energy company together. Then they pivoted to AI marketing tools. I'm looking for founders who have been living inside their problem -- who possess understanding that can't be acquired through six months of research. What non-obvious insight about how AI models select and cite sources do these founders have that a competent ML engineer at Peec AI doesn't? The dossier is explicit: neither founder has documented background in marketing, SEO, or content strategy. Their ML expertise is genuine but transferable -- any strong engineer can query LLMs and analyze citation patterns. This is the kind of founding team that identified a hot market and applied general technical skill to it, not one where the founder's specific knowledge produced a contrarian insight about the problem space.

The leverage architecture is standard SaaS. Analytics dashboard plus content generation plus CMS delivery. It's a tool that makes existing marketing teams marginally more efficient at a new task. Compare this to what excites me: Replit gives anyone who can think the power to build software. Notion turns one knowledge worker into a coordination engine. Those create new forms of leverage -- new categories of capability that didn't exist before. Sitefire makes existing capability slightly faster. A marketing team using Sitefire does the same work they were already doing, just with better data about AI citations. There's no leverage multiplication here -- no protocol, no network effect, no mechanism where one user's activity makes the product exponentially more valuable for the next user.

The bull case deserves articulation. The BMW, Xtrackers, and DWS enterprise relationships are genuinely notable for a two-person pre-seed team -- landing Europe's largest brands suggests the founders have exceptional sales ability and perhaps a network advantage through their Munich/TUM connections. If you reframe the problem as "reverse-engineering neural information retrieval" rather than "marketing analytics," Jochen's optimization and RL research becomes more directly relevant -- understanding why LLMs cite what they cite is fundamentally a machine learning problem. And the differentiation of closing the loop from analysis to automated content creation and CMS delivery is real -- competitors monitor, Sitefire acts. If content quality proves high enough for enterprise brands to publish under their names, that's a meaningful workflow integration that creates switching costs. The question is whether this differentiation survives the next twelve months as Peec AI (with 15x more capital) and the SEO incumbents add content generation to their platforms.

But the structural problem remains. The monitoring layer is commoditizing visibly. The content generation layer uses the same foundation models available to every competitor. CMS integrations are engineering work, not compounding technology. The dossier identifies no moat signals and explicitly flags commoditization risk. For the technology to compound, Sitefire would need proprietary data on citation patterns that improves recommendations over time -- but that advantage accrues to whoever has the most customers first, and Peec AI already has 1,300 brands. In a race where scale of data determines quality of output, entering late with less capital against an entrenched competitor is not the position I want to fund.

I'm passing. Smart founders, real market, wrong configuration. The founders don't have the domain-specific knowledge that would let them see what Peec AI's team can't. The market is consensus, not contrarian. The technology doesn't compound distinctively. And the leverage is linear -- better tools for existing workflows, not new capabilities for new categories of people. I want to fund companies where the founder knows something that can't be taught, building leverage that didn't exist before, at a moment when the crowd thinks they're wrong. Sitefire is competent generalists building in a category the crowd has already validated.
