# Agentic Fabriq -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about Agentic Fabriq is not the company itself -- it's the market signal surrounding it. Over $200M in dedicated startup funding has already been deployed into the agent identity and permission management space. Oasis Security raised $75M. Astrix raised $85M. CrowdStrike just acquired SGNL for $740M. Okta shipped Auth for GenAI and its Cross App Access protocol months before this company even launched. Microsoft is building agent identity features into Entra. When the biggest players and the best-funded startups are all converging on the same problem simultaneously, the asymmetric upside has been priced out. "Anyone in this business who's chasing hot markets gets killed." This isn't contrarian timing -- this is arriving at the consensus party after the music is already playing.

The specific knowledge question is where I lose conviction entirely. Paulina and Matthew Xu have legitimate AI and ML research backgrounds from serious MIT labs -- Kavli, Haystack, CSAIL. That gives them understanding of how AI agents work. But the problem they're solving isn't an AI problem. It's an enterprise identity, access management, and compliance problem. Building a control plane for agent permissions requires deep knowledge of OAuth delegation architectures, enterprise security procurement, SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certification workflows, how IT administrators actually think about least-privilege enforcement at scale. That knowledge comes from years inside enterprise security organizations, not from computational biology research at CSAIL. The founders dropped out at 19. No prior exits. No enterprise security experience. No IAM background. They identified a real gap -- but it's a gap that any attentive person reading Microsoft's security blog could identify in an afternoon. That's not specific knowledge; that's pattern recognition applied to a trending category.

The leverage architecture has a structural problem that concerns me more than the market competition. The product requires building and maintaining prebuilt connectors to enterprise tools -- every SaaS application, every database, every workflow system an enterprise uses. Each connector is engineering work that scales linearly with coverage. When third-party APIs change, the connectors break and need maintenance. This is the iPaaS trap: it looks like infrastructure but operates more like a services business disguised in a software wrapper. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question-and-answer pair made the knowledge graph more valuable without proportional engineering effort, or to Alchemy, where one API abstraction layer served every blockchain developer. The "connectors plus policy engine plus audit logs" stack doesn't create new leverage -- it assembles known components into a configuration layer.

The strongest bull case requires believing three things simultaneously: that Okta's bolt-on approach to agent permissions will prove structurally inadequate because its data model was built for human SSO; that the employee-to-agent permission mapping is a genuinely new primitive requiring a new architectural approach; and that switching costs will lock in early enterprise adopters before competitors close the gap. If all three are true, the company sitting at the center of every enterprise's agent permission graph would have enormous strategic value -- every agent, every tool, every employee's access scoped through a single control plane. The 40% of enterprise apps projected to embed agents by 2026, up from 5% in early 2025, represents a real inflection. But this bull case demands that two first-time founders with $500K out-execute Okta's enterprise sales machine and Oasis's $75M war chest in enterprise security deals -- a domain where credibility, certifications, and existing relationships determine who gets past procurement. That's not a bet on specific knowledge producing non-obvious insight. That's a bet on speed in a category where speed alone doesn't compound.

The founders' willingness to drop out of MIT at 19 signals genuine conviction, and I don't see integrity red flags. But conviction about a problem isn't the same as possessing non-transferable knowledge about how to solve it. The dossier itself notes that "the underlying technical components (OAuth delegation, policy engines, audit logging) are well-understood building blocks that multiple teams could assemble." When the building blocks are commoditized and the market is crowded with well-capitalized teams assembling the same blocks, the differentiator has to be the founder's unique insight about how the pieces fit together differently. I don't see evidence of that insight here -- the "employee-scoped agent permissions" framing is a reasonable product positioning choice, not a deep architectural breakthrough that emerges from years of domain immersion.
