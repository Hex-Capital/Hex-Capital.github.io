# Voxel Energy -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most important question about Voxel Energy isn't whether the market is real -- it's whether a pre-seed company can survive a direct competitive collision with Crusoe, which has $3.9 billion in funding and is pursuing an almost identical approach: off-grid data centers powered by second-life EV batteries, built through a partnership with Redwood Materials. When I led Anduril's $450M Series D, the structural vacancy was total -- Google's Project Maven cancellation opened a defense AI category with zero credible startup competitors. That's not what's happening here. Voxel is entering a market where the best-funded competitor has already staked out the same thesis, has 86 operational sites, and a 45 GW power pipeline. The competitive asymmetry runs in the wrong direction.

The structural moment is undeniably real. AI compute demand has overwhelmed grid capacity, interconnection queues stretch past five years, and half of $3 trillion in planned data center projects may not get built for lack of power. Three curves are converging: AI workload growth is exponential, second-life EV battery supply is inflecting (41.72% CAGR projected through 2040), and GPU architectures natively operate on DC power -- making Voxel's DC microgrid architecture technically elegant rather than merely clever. The 30%-to-4% energy loss reduction from eliminating AC/DC conversion stages is a real engineering insight. But here's my problem: this market is the opposite of non-obvious. Every LP deck, every energy investor, every hyperscaler strategy team has "data center power" circled in red. When I look at PagerDuty or Gusto, those were markets other investors dismissed. Nobody is dismissing data center power -- they're throwing billions at it. The structural moment is clear, but it's consensus-clear, which means the returns accrue to whoever has the most capital and the strongest execution, not whoever saw it first.

The team's domain fit is the strongest signal in this dossier, and it's genuinely impressive for pre-seed. Pfeiffer built Maxwell Vehicles -- described as a multi-million dollar EV manufacturing business that specifically pioneered second-life EV battery reuse. That's not adjacent experience; that's direct operational knowledge of the hardest technical component in Voxel's stack. Spencer spent 7.5 years on Tesla Autopilot and has founded three hardware companies. Schmidt brings a decade of data center construction management. They've already secured thousands of acres under contract (upgraded from an initial "hundreds"), are accumulating battery inventory, and have a working prototype running off-grid compute. For a pre-seed hardware company, that velocity is real. These aren't founders who pivoted into energy because it's hot -- they've been building in this domain.

But the single-miracle test is where this breaks down. Voxel needs to simultaneously solve at least three hard problems: (1) commercialize the DC microgrid architecture at a scale that meets 99.99% uptime SLAs -- off-grid, with weather-dependent generation and degrading batteries; (2) build a reliable supply chain for second-life batteries, which vary dramatically by chemistry, manufacturer, and usage history and account for less than 0.1% of grid-scale projects today; (3) raise the capital to compete in a market where the leading competitor has four thousand times their funding. Each of these is a legitimate challenge. Together, they compound into the kind of multi-miracle plan I consistently pass on. Pfeiffer's Maxwell Vehicles experience partially de-risks the battery supply chain piece, which is why I don't view this as a hard pass -- but "partially de-risks one of three miracles" isn't enough.

The bull case is straightforward and I want to be honest about it: if Voxel's DC microgrid architecture provides a meaningful efficiency and deployment speed advantage over Crusoe's approach, and if second-life battery supply scales faster than expected (creating an abundance that favors nimble operators over Redwood Materials' centralized model), this team could own a valuable niche. The months-not-years deployment timeline, if achievable, is a genuine differentiation against every competitor building at campus scale. Crusoe is optimizing for gigawatt campuses; Voxel could capture the long tail of smaller, faster deployments for AI companies that need power next quarter, not next year. That's a real wedge. But I'd need to see evidence that this speed advantage translates into signed contracts, not just capacity reservations -- and I'd need to see a plausible path to the capital required to build physical infrastructure at the scale where unit economics work.

The product-to-distribution trajectory is limited by the physics of the business model. Powered data center space can become a platform for compute services and monitoring, and the Sift partnership suggests some platform thinking. But fundamentally, this is a physical infrastructure business -- each new site requires land, solar arrays, batteries, and construction. That's not Stripe, where a single API integration distributes ten additional products. Distribution here means sales relationships and land acquisition, not software-driven compounding. The business is more "software-aware" than "software-driven" in my framework -- the DC microgrid control software is important, but remove it and you still have a solar-plus-battery data center. A smart toaster that happens to be well-engineered is still in the toaster business.
