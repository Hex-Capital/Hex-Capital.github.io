# Verdex -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The central puzzle of Verdex is a number: 11% of all American farmland. That's roughly 59 million acres. Two Dartmouth graduates, months out of school, claim on their YC page to be helping insure that much land. No named customer confirms it. No press covers it. No independent source corroborates it. Either these founders have achieved something genuinely remarkable for a pre-seed company -- landing at least one of the 16 USDA-approved insurance providers as a real customer -- or the word "helping" is doing enormous work in that sentence. The ambiguity matters because without that number, Verdex is a two-person team with an idea. With it, they have a wedge into a market that's notoriously hard to enter.

The problem itself is the right kind of ugly. Agricultural insurance claims in America run through a Rube Goldberg machine of USDA regulations, physical field inspections, and 16 approved insurance providers who process claims on 540 million acres. The schlep is genuine and multi-layered: you need satellite data pipelines, weather model fusion, crop-specific damage algorithms, and -- this is the part that scares off engineers -- deep familiarity with federal program rules governing how claims can be verified. Ceres AI raised $86 million but aimed at growers and agronomists, not claims settlement. EOSDA built a horizontal satellite platform. Nobody built the specific infrastructure that lets an adjuster settle a claim from a desk. That gap has existed for years, and the reason nobody filled it is the same reason nobody built Stripe for a decade: the regulatory and institutional complexity is the moat, but it's also the barrier to getting started. Verdex is pointed at the right hole in the market.

But here's my concern: how did they find it? Jad Bousselham had a prior agriculture technology project at Dartmouth that won a small founder grant, which suggests some pre-existing interest in the space. That's worth something. But neither founder has documented experience in agriculture or insurance. They didn't grow up farming. They didn't work at an insurance carrier. Jad previously interviewed at YC with a completely different project called SignPact, which suggests a founder searching for the right idea rather than one who couldn't stop thinking about a problem they'd lived with. The strongest organic discoveries happen when the problem found the founder, not the other way around. I can't tell whether Verdex emerged from genuine immersion in ag-tech or from a smart analysis of large regulated markets with broken workflows. The distinction matters because navigating USDA regulations and selling to 16 institutional buyers requires the kind of domain intuition you only get from years inside the industry -- or from an extraordinary willingness to learn it the hard way.

The bull case is real, and I want to be honest about it. If Verdex has even one actual AIP relationship -- which the 11% number might imply -- they're in a position that's structurally hard to replicate. Sixteen buyers is a concentrated market, which means direct sales work. Once an insurer integrates your satellite-based claims data into their workflow and starts building historical baselines on it, switching costs compound every season. The timing is right: Planet offers daily global coverage, Sentinel-2 provides free 10-meter imagery every five days, and computer vision has crossed the threshold where remote damage assessment can compete with a guy driving to a field. If these founders have the determination to navigate the regulatory thicket and the technical ability to build accurate damage assessment models, this could become critical infrastructure for the entire federal crop insurance program. That's a real business.

The technical foundation is plausible but not demonstrated. Jad's math and CS background is the right training for satellite data fusion. Evan won an engineering prize for an ML capstone applying machine learning to diagnostic assessment, which shows applied modeling capability. But I can't find a single public GitHub repo for either founder. At a two-person company building satellite analytics infrastructure, I want to see evidence that the founders are the kind of programmers who build things because they can't help themselves. The absence of any visible technical output -- no open source work, no public projects beyond school -- leaves me uncertain about whether we're looking at builders or at capable students who identified an opportunity.

I'd feel differently about Verdex if I could see two things: first, a credible organic story connecting these founders to the specific pain of crop insurance claims -- not "agriculture is interesting" but "we watched adjusters spend three days driving to fields after a hailstorm and realized this was insane." Second, independent confirmation that the 11% number represents a real commercial relationship, not a pilot or data partnership being described generously. Either of those signals would significantly move my conviction. As it stands, the problem is the right kind of ugly, the market structure is favorable for a small team, and the timing with satellite infrastructure is good. But the founders' connection to the problem is thin, the traction claim is unverified, and I'm not sure these are the specific people who will survive the multi-year schlep of selling into federal crop insurance. Smart founders, interesting problem, insufficient evidence of the organic fit that separates companies that endure from companies that pivot after a year.
