# Reframe -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out here is Didero. A company building AI agents for manufacturing procurement just raised $30 million in Series A — backed by Microsoft's M12 — in February 2026. Same month Reframe enters YC. This isn't a case where Reframe is pursuing a non-consensus idea that mainstream VCs dismiss. The market has already been validated, the checks have been written, and the competitor has an 18-month head start with 18x more capital. When I'm looking for a sane person with an insane idea, and the idea already has $37 million in institutional validation from sophisticated investors, I'm looking at a sane person with a thoroughly sane idea. That's the worst configuration for my framework — you're buying consensus at market price, but without the distribution advantages the consensus play already secured.

Let me run my "cherry on top" test, which is really the test I wish I'd applied more rigorously to Birchbox. If AI didn't exist, would Reframe be a good business? The answer is unambiguously no. There is no business without the AI agents. The entire value proposition IS the AI layer — ingesting BOMs, communicating with suppliers, dynamically updating build plans. Strip the AI and you have... a consulting firm? A spreadsheet? This is the precise category I've been publicly flagging since 2024: an "AI-powered" version of an existing workflow where the AI capability is obvious, replicable, and will be absorbed by incumbents with distribution. SAP and Oracle already own the procurement software for large enterprises. Didero is gunning for the mid-market with Microsoft's backing. Every LLM provider is making agent frameworks more accessible by the quarter. The moat here is a sandcastle and the tide is AI commoditization — the exact opposite of what I look for.

Bryan Zin's Apple iPhone hardware background is the one genuinely interesting signal. Four years designing product for the most sophisticated hardware supply chain on earth gives him real credibility on the pain point. Eric Wiener's ML engineering pedigree from Zoox and DoorDash is solid for building agents. If I'm being honest about the bull case: the domain of overseas hardware procurement is genuinely messy — tolerances, lead times, multi-supplier sequencing, language barriers with Shenzhen factories, customs logistics. There's physical-world complexity here that creates switching costs once embedded. If Reframe could accumulate proprietary supplier performance data across dozens of hardware customers, that data flywheel could become a real defensibility layer over time. And there's a plausible narrative where hardware startups proliferate (robotics, EVs, wearables, drones) and all need procurement infrastructure they can't build in-house. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe Reframe can win a land grab against a better-funded competitor by being more focused on the hardware build-schedule coordination niche, accumulate enough customer data to create genuine lock-in before Didero or an LLM-native feature from an ERP vendor catches up, and expand from "procurement agent" to "hardware operations platform." That's three things that all need to go right simultaneously against a competitor with a massive head start.

On the primitive-versus-application test: Reframe is building an application on top of existing LLM infrastructure. It's not creating a new protocol, a new data standard, or a foundational layer that other companies build on. It's a workflow tool — a good workflow tool, potentially, but a tool nonetheless. My largest returns come from protocol-layer investments that create compounding network effects. Venmo created a new payment primitive. Solana created a new consensus mechanism. Aleo created a new privacy primitive. Reframe is using someone else's primitives to automate someone else's workflow. The ceiling on that is inherently bounded, and every improvement in the underlying LLMs benefits your competitors equally.

The complete absence of any traction signal compounds the structural concerns. No revenue, no customer logos, no LOIs, no waitlist, no Product Hunt launch, nothing. At pre-seed this isn't unusual, but when you're entering a market where Didero already has customers and $37 million, the absence of even a single named design partner is concerning. I need to see evidence that hardware companies are choosing Reframe's approach over the alternatives — and right now there's zero evidence of any customer interaction at all. The brand collision with another YC company called Reframe is a minor irritant but symbolic of a broader problem: this company hasn't yet established any distinct identity in its market.

I'd rather fund a company that makes physical things more efficiently using software as a layer — a Craftwork for hardware manufacturing, where the operational complexity IS the moat and AI just makes the scheduling tighter — than fund an AI agent that coordinates procurement from a Slack window. The former gets stronger as AI improves. The latter gets commoditized.
