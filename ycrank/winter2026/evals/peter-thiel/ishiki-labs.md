# Ishiki Labs -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Ishiki Labs is not the product but the founders' provenance -- and what that provenance reveals about the competitive structure they're walking into. Both Amit Yadav and Robert Xu spent years at Meta building precisely the system they now want to commercialize: always-on, socially-aware multimodal AI assistants for smart glasses. Amit trained multimodal LLMs on the LLaMA team and built video assistants for Reality Labs. Robert spent four years engineering the orchestration infrastructure that runs these assistants on constrained hardware like the Orion AR glasses. This is not the usual "ex-FAANG founder with tangential experience" story. These two people literally built the thing, inside one of the most well-resourced AI labs on the planet, and then left to build it independently. The immediate question this raises is: why did Meta let them? The answer almost certainly is that Meta is building this capability for its own hardware platform. Which means the founders' most dangerous competitor is their former employer.

The secret question is where this falls apart. What does Ishiki Labs believe that most intelligent people actively disagree with? The stated insight -- that AI assistants need social awareness, that they interrupt when they shouldn't, that they cannot tell whether you're addressing them or someone else -- is not a secret. It is a product observation that every engineer working on voice AI at OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic can articulate. The entire industry is converging on this problem. When I read that ChatGPT Voice and Gemini Live "lack social awareness," I am reading a statement of the current state of the art, not a contrarian thesis. A genuine secret would be something like: "Social awareness in AI requires a fundamentally different architecture that foundation model scaling will never solve" -- and the founders would be building that architecture. But there is no evidence of that claim. Instead, Ishiki Labs appears to be building an application layer on top of commodity foundation models, competing on a feature dimension -- knowing when to be quiet -- that every major platform provider is already working to solve.

The competitive landscape confirms the mimetic diagnosis. Otter.ai has raised $70 million and generates $100 million in ARR. Fireflies.ai reached a billion-dollar valuation. Read.ai has raised $81 million. Granola has raised $67 million. These companies are all converging from different starting points -- transcription, automation, analytics, note-taking -- toward the same destination: the AI meeting assistant that understands context, provides real-time value, and integrates into your workflow. Ishiki Labs enters this field with a two-person team and YC funding, claiming differentiation on a single axis: social awareness. But the axis itself is temporary. As multimodal models improve -- and they are improving rapidly -- the gap between "transcription-first tools" and "socially-aware copilots" will close. Meanwhile, Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet are adding native AI features to platforms that already own the user relationship. Microsoft Copilot is already providing real-time meeting assistance within Teams. Building a standalone meeting copilot that must join as an external participant is architecturally disadvantaged against native integrations that have zero marginal distribution cost.

The bull case deserves serious examination. If the social awareness problem is genuinely harder than it appears -- if it requires years of specialized research in multimodal inference, conversational dynamics, and latency optimization that cannot be replicated simply by throwing compute at larger models -- then Yadav and Xu may be two of fewer than fifty people on Earth qualified to solve it. Amit's twenty-plus publications at CVPR, NeurIPS, and ICASSP, combined with Robert's four years optimizing real-time multimodal systems on constrained hardware, represent accumulated knowledge that is not easily transferred. If they can build a product that genuinely works -- an AI that sits in your meetings, understands everything, and speaks only when spoken to -- and if they can reach critical mass before the platforms catch up, the resulting user habits could create meaningful switching costs. Professionals who learn to rely on a real-time advisor in high-stakes conversations (sales calls, investor pitches, board meetings) would find it painful to lose that capability. The timing argument has some force: existing tools have trained the market to accept AI in meetings, but none deliver real-time value during the conversation itself. There is a gap between what professionals want and what they can get today. But even this strongest version of the bull case does not resolve the monopoly question. User habits without structural moats are fragile. When Zoom bundles equivalent functionality for free, habits break overnight.

What I cannot find in this company is a path to monopoly that survives contact with the competitive landscape. No network effects -- my meeting copilot does not improve because you use one. No economies of scale unique to Ishiki Labs -- the underlying models are available to everyone. No supply-side exclusivity like Spotify's licensing agreements. No small-market beachhead strategy -- the go-to-market appears to target "professionals" generically rather than monopolizing a specific niche first. The founders are building from Meta's playbook, in Meta's backyard, against Meta's own roadmap, and against a half-dozen well-funded startups pursuing adjacent approaches. This is the structural pattern I have spent twenty years avoiding. Exceptional founders in a market without a monopoly path build good companies, not great ones. The power law demands that I invest only where the upside, if realized, is extreme -- and a socially-aware meeting assistant, even a brilliant one, is bounded by a competitive market structure that prevents the kind of winner-take-all dynamics I require.
