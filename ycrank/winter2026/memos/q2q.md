## The Idea

**Problem:** Private equity firms, search funds, and independent sponsors rely on junior analysts to manually source acquisition targets — researching industries, building prospect lists, finding owner contact information, writing outreach emails, and booking introductory calls. This process is time-intensive, expensive, and produces generic outreach. The industry relies on the same databases (e.g., PitchBook, Grata), causing business owners to receive duplicative, impersonal messages that reduce response rates (YC Launch page, Feb 2026). Current alternatives range from hiring junior analysts/interns, to using deal sourcing databases like Grata or SourceScrub, to engaging buy-side search firms like SourceCo.

**Approach:** Q2Q automates the full sourcing-to-meeting workflow. Users input their acquisition criteria (investment thesis, company type, geography, etc.), and Q2Q: (1) identifies private companies matching those criteria, (2) researches each company using web and social media data to write personalized outreach, (3) deploys an AI phone agent to call business owners directly for contact confirmation and availability, and (4) books meetings with prepared notes synced to the user's calendar. The human-in-the-loop element is message approval — users review and approve outreach before it is sent (YC Launch page, Feb 2026).

**Differentiation:** Existing deal sourcing platforms (Grata, SourceScrub, Affinity) primarily provide databases and search tools — the user still must execute the outreach themselves. Buy-side search firms (SourceCo) provide high-touch services but at higher cost and lower speed. Q2Q differentiates by combining sourcing intelligence with automated multi-channel outreach (email + AI phone agent) and meeting booking into a single workflow. The AI phone agent component appears to be a specific differentiator not present in database-only platforms (YC Launch page, Feb 2026).

**Business Model:** No public pricing page was accessible at time of research (website rendered as JavaScript-only with no extractable content). [Inferred]: Most likely monetization path is a SaaS subscription model, potentially with tiered pricing based on number of outreach campaigns, meetings booked, or seats, given the B2B SaaS positioning and PE buyer audience.

**TAM/SAM:** No public TAM/SAM data found for the specific deal sourcing software segment. For context, Datasite committed $500M to expand its private market intelligence solutions organically and inorganically (BusinessWire, Jun 2025), and acquired both Grata and SourceScrub in 2025, signaling market consolidation and perceived value. Nearly half of dealmakers (49%) report using AI tools almost daily (Grata, 2025 via search snippet).

**GTM / Distribution:** The YC Launch page asks for introductions to "private equity professionals, M&A specialists, independent sponsors, MBAs, and search fund operators in acquisition mode" (YC Launch page, Feb 2026). [Inferred]: Initial distribution is likely founder-led sales leveraging Brianna Lin's PE network from her buyout firm and Jefferies experience, combined with YC's network of PE-connected alumni. The search fund and independent sponsor community is relatively tight-knit, suggesting potential word-of-mouth distribution within that segment.

## Defensibility

No defensibility signals found in public sources at this stage.

[Inferred]: Potential moat could develop via (1) proprietary data on which outreach messages and strategies yield the highest owner response rates across industries and geographies — a data flywheel that improves with each campaign; (2) switching costs once PE teams integrate Q2Q into their deal pipeline workflows and CRM systems; (3) accumulated relationship mapping data that improves targeting over time. These are unproven at this stage.

**Market structure:** The deal sourcing database incumbents (Grata/Datasite, PitchBook/Morningstar) are primarily data and intelligence platforms. Adding automated outbound and meeting-booking functionality would require them to take on email deliverability, compliance, and AI voice agent capabilities that are outside their core competency. Datasite's acquisition strategy (buying Grata and SourceScrub) suggests a build-by-acquisition approach rather than organic product expansion into outbound workflows. [Inferred]: The structural barrier is that database providers monetize via subscriptions for data access, while an outbound engine monetizes via outcomes (meetings booked), creating potential business model tension for incumbents that adds features cannibalizing their users' need for manual analyst headcount.

**Commoditization risk:** The underlying components — company database access, email personalization via LLMs, AI voice agents, calendar booking — are individually available as APIs and tools. A well-resourced competitor or adjacent player (e.g., an AI SDR platform like 11x or Artisan expanding into PE, or a CRM like Affinity adding outbound) could build comparable functionality. The barrier to entry is integration quality and domain-specific tuning for the PE deal-sourcing workflow rather than any single proprietary technology.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **Grata (acquired by Datasite, Jun 2025):** AI-driven private market intelligence platform with 16 million company profiles. Raised ~$35M total, including a $25M Series A led by Craft Ventures (Jan 2022) (Crunchbase via search snippet). Acquired by Datasite for an undisclosed amount as part of a $500M investment commitment (BusinessWire, Jun 2025). Key differentiator vs. Q2Q: database and intelligence platform focused on search and screening; does not automate outreach execution or meeting booking.

2. **SourceScrub (acquired by Datasite, Aug 2025):** Deal sourcing platform that continuously crawls the web to find private companies, connecting them to 290,000+ sources. Previously backed by Francisco Partners and Mainsail Partners (Crunchbase via search snippet). Acquired by Datasite (Aug 2025); being integrated into Grata. Key differentiator vs. Q2Q: focused on data discovery and tracking, not outbound outreach automation.

3. **Affinity:** Relationship intelligence CRM for private capital. Raised $120M+, including an $80M Series C led by Menlo Ventures (Affinity press release, Sep 2021). 1,700+ customers in 70 countries including Bain Capital Ventures and SoftBank (Affinity website via search snippet). Key differentiator vs. Q2Q: CRM and relationship-mapping focus; does not provide automated outreach or meeting booking for new targets.

4. **SourceCo:** Buy-side acquisition search firm covering 200M+ companies with 150+ investment teams as clients (SourceCo website via search snippet). Operates as a services/tech-enabled advisory model rather than pure SaaS. Key differentiator vs. Q2Q: high-touch human service model vs. Q2Q's AI-automated approach. Funding data not publicly available.

**Why now:** [Inferred]: Two converging catalysts opened this window: (1) LLM capabilities reached the quality threshold in 2024-2025 where AI-generated personalized outreach emails and AI voice agents can pass the quality bar expected by business owners, making automated outbound viable where it previously was not. (2) Consolidation of incumbent deal sourcing databases by Datasite (acquiring both Grata and SourceScrub in 2025) may create platform lock-in concerns and openness among PE teams to try alternative, more workflow-integrated tools.

**Co-founder relationship:** Both founders studied in the same program — the Jerome Fisher M&T Program at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer Science and Finance. This shared educational background indicates prior acquaintance through their undergraduate program.

**Founder-market fit:** Brianna Lin's direct experience as a PE analyst at a software buyout firm and as a Jefferies investment banker gives her firsthand exposure to the manual deal sourcing workflow Q2Q aims to automate, as well as a network within the PE buyer community. Claire Wu's engineering background (hedge fund engineering, Qualtrics product management) and AI interests (Meta AI hackathon selection) position her to build the technical product. The combination of PE domain expertise (Brianna) and engineering/product skills (Claire) maps directly to the problem.

## Key Risks

**Brand disambiguation and discoverability:** "Q2Q" is a common string shared by multiple established businesses — Q2Q Communications, Q2Q Global, Q2Q IT, Q2Q Ltd. — across telecom and IT services. This creates SEO competition, potential customer confusion, and trademark complexity. The domain tryq2q.com (rather than q2q.com) reflects this constraint.

**Incumbent platform expansion:** Datasite's 2025 acquisitions of both Grata and SourceScrub, with a $500M investment commitment (BusinessWire, Jun 2025), signal an intent to build an end-to-end deal intelligence platform. If Datasite adds outbound automation and meeting-booking to its combined Grata/SourceScrub platform, Q2Q would face a well-resourced competitor with existing PE firm relationships and data assets.

**AI outbound deliverability and compliance:** Automated email outreach at scale faces increasing spam filtering, CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance requirements, and business owner fatigue from AI-generated messages. If email providers tighten deliverability rules for automated outbound or if business owner response rates to AI outreach decline, Q2Q's core value proposition (booked meetings) would be directly impacted.

**AI SDR market convergence:** General-purpose AI SDR platforms (e.g., 11x, Artisan, Instantly) could expand into the PE deal sourcing vertical with relatively modest domain customization, given that the outreach automation mechanics are similar across sales and deal sourcing use cases. The PE-specific differentiation may not constitute a durable barrier against well-funded horizontal players.
