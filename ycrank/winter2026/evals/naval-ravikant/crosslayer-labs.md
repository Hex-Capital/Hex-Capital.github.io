# Crosslayer Labs -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The founders of Crosslayer Labs didn't just study internet infrastructure attacks. They invented the defense that became a global mandate. Henry Birge-Lee coded the first MPIC implementation in 2016, published the foundational paper at USENIX Security in 2018, and then co-authored the CA/Browser Forum ballot that made it mandatory for every certificate authority on earth. That standard now secures approximately eight million certificates issued daily. Prateek Mittal's research shaped the design of Tor and Let's Encrypt. This is specific knowledge in its purest form — knowledge that took a decade to accumulate, that literally cannot be replicated by hiring smart engineers for six months, and that has already reshaped how the internet works. When I backed Stack Overflow, part of the thesis was that the team had irreplaceable knowledge about how developers learn and share information — knowledge embedded in years of building developer communities. The Crosslayer team has something even rarer: they defined a protocol that the entire internet adopted, and now they're building the commercial monitoring layer on top of it. That's not domain expertise. That's domain authorship.

The leverage question is where the thesis gets more complicated. MPIC itself is pure protocol-level leverage — one standard, written once, securing billions of certificates. But the commercial product is enterprise B2B security SaaS: outside-in monitoring dashboards, demo-driven sales, probable per-domain pricing. Software has baseline leverage by nature, but there's no obvious network effect here. Each new customer doesn't make the product more valuable for other customers. Each sale likely requires integration work and security team buy-in. This is closer to selling a specialized instrument than building a platform. I systematically favor infrastructure and picks-and-shovels plays, and cross-layer internet monitoring is genuinely infrastructure-level — but the business model doesn't create a new form of leverage that didn't exist before. It's a better monitoring tool, not a new category of capability.

The contrarian timing is real and underappreciated. The entire cybersecurity industry is chasing AI-powered threat detection — every pitch deck features an LLM analyzing logs. Crosslayer is doing something almost anachronistic: going back to the fundamental protocol layers of the internet and saying that DNS, BGP, and TLS are still under-monitored and under-defended. The MPIC mandate in 2025 validated their threat model, but the mandate also created a narrow window. Right now, CAs and enterprises are newly aware that BGP hijacking can compromise certificate issuance. Most security investors would dismiss infrastructure-layer impersonation as too niche, too academic. That dismissal is itself the signal — when smart people wave something away as "too specialized," pricing hasn't caught up. The Klayswap example — $2 million stolen via a single compromised JavaScript file — is the kind of concrete, painful proof point that converts skeptics.

The bull case that would make me write a larger check: the team's CA/Browser Forum relationships — built through years of standardization work with Google, Apple, Amazon, Let's Encrypt, Sectigo — function as a proprietary distribution channel disguised as academic credibility. These are not cold calls. When you co-authored the standard that every CA must now implement, you have trust that no sales team can manufacture. If Crosslayer can convert that trust into enterprise contracts with the organizations that issue certificates and the enterprises that depend on them, they have a wedge into a $5 billion market through a door that only they can open. The cross-layer correlation engine — combining BGP, DNS, TLS, and JavaScript signals — could develop compounding defensibility as it accumulates attack patterns. Each detected incident enriches the model in ways that a competitor starting from scratch would need years to replicate.

The concern that holds my conviction below the top tier: the academic-to-commercial transition. Three Princeton researchers, no prior startup exits, no evidence of someone on the team who can sell. The PhD-to-CEO path works — I've seen it — but it requires a founder who wants to build a company, not just publish the next paper. Mittal as "Chief Scientist" almost certainly means part-time, which is fine for credibility but leaves two PhD students running the entire operation. The narrow attack vector focus is also a structural question — enterprises want fewer security vendors, not more. Can cross-layer impersonation monitoring grow into a broader platform, or will it remain a point solution that gets absorbed as a feature by CrowdStrike or Palo Alto? The technology moat is genuine but the commercial moat is unproven.

I'd invest, sized modestly. The specific knowledge here is extraordinary — among the deepest I've evaluated at pre-seed. The founders authored a global internet standard. That's not something you can train someone to do. The leverage architecture and commercial execution are the gaps, and those are addressable gaps, not structural deficiencies. This is a bet on knowledge that compounds at the protocol layer, with the open question being whether the team can translate protocol authority into commercial authority.
