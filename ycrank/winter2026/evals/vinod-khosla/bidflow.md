# Bidflow -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Bidflow: two genuinely exceptional young engineers -- USACO Platinum, Jane Street extern at eighteen, bootstrapped a company to $120K revenue at sixteen -- and they've pointed all that firepower at making electrical contractors fill out spreadsheets faster. That's the core tension. These founders could be working on problems that reshape how energy infrastructure gets built, how construction labor gets allocated, how buildings get designed from scratch. Instead, they've chosen to optimize one step in one trade's bidding workflow. The consequence of success is a solid vertical SaaS business in a $2 billion software market. Nobody's world changes. The electrical contracting industry doesn't operate differently -- contractors just spend fewer hours on the estimating step before doing the same physical work the same way.

I understand the bull case, and I want to take it seriously. Data center construction is exploding -- AI workloads are driving electrical infrastructure demand at a pace the industry hasn't seen. The labor shortage in skilled trades is real and worsening. If Bidflow starts with estimating and expands to become the operating system for electrical contractors -- procurement, scheduling, project management -- they could own a vertical platform serving a $237 billion services market. The Square analogy is tempting: start with one wedge (a card reader, an estimating tool), then build the full platform. And the legacy incumbents are genuinely stuck -- ConEst and Trimble are desktop-installed software with architectures that predate the smartphone. A web-native, AI-first platform should eventually displace them. If the data flywheel works and accuracy climbs from 83.5% to 98%, the value proposition becomes compelling enough to pull contractors off tools they've used for decades. That's a real business -- maybe a $5-10 billion outcome.

But here's what I notice that most investors would miss: the founders have systematically narrowed their aperture to minimize risk. One trade. One workflow step. One geography (Northeast U.S.). "Assistant, not a replacement" -- their own framing. This is exactly the pattern I warn against most viscerally: they've reduced the probability of failure to the point where the consequences of success are, frankly, modest. They're not attempting to transform how buildings get built. They're not challenging the fundamental economics of construction labor. They're making an existing process run faster within the existing system. Beam AI has $48M and 1,100 customers pursuing AI construction takeoffs. Togal.AI has $17.5M. The category is consensus, not contrarian -- which means the outsider advantage that creates asymmetric returns has already evaporated.

The pivot from Ghostship -- QA agents for bug detection -- to electrical estimating in what appears to be a single batch cycle tells me something important about the team. These are smart, adaptable founders searching for product-market fit, and searching is a valid strategy. But it's not the kind of deep, obsessive problem conviction I've seen in my best investments. Pat Brown spent years thinking about animal agriculture before I met him. Pradeep Sindhu and I spent six months in weekly meetings before Juniper existed as a company. The founders who create transformational companies are usually consumed by one problem, not iterating through verticals. Jesse and Gautham may develop that conviction for construction tech over time -- the Bass Electric relationship and customer testimonial suggest they're learning the domain rapidly -- but right now, the depth of domain obsession isn't visible.

On the technology itself: 83.5% accuracy on electrical takeoffs means roughly one in six counts needs manual correction. On a project with thousands of data points, that's still hundreds of corrections. The founders position this honestly -- it's a first pass, not a replacement -- but it also means the technology today augments rather than disrupts the existing workflow. Augmentation tools have real value but they don't make the incumbent approach obsolete. A contractor using Bidflow still needs an experienced estimator reviewing every output. Compare this to how Square made traditional POS infrastructure structurally uneconomic, or how Juniper's TCP/IP routing made legacy telecom architectures irrelevant. The disruption test -- does the technology, at scale, make the current way of doing things unviable? -- comes back negative here. It makes the current way faster, not obsolete.

These founders are clearly talented enough to build something transformational. I'd tell them what I've told many technically brilliant teams: you're too talented to spend your careers on a problem with this ceiling. The electrical estimating market is real, the pain is real, and you'll probably build a decent business. But the world doesn't need you specifically for that -- any competent team with AI engineering skills can build a construction takeoff tool, and several well-funded ones already are. What the world needs from founders with your rate of learning and raw ability is an attack on a problem where success reshapes how things work. Find the version of this that terrifies you.
