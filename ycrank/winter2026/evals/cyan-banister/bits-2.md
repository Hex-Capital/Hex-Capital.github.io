# Bits -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately about Bits: within weeks of OpenClaw hitting 214,000 GitHub stars, at least six other companies launched managed hosting for the same open-source project, with prices already spanning from two dollars a month to seventy-nine. That's not a market forming -- that's a gold rush. And I've learned to run the other way from gold rushes. The most promising companies are not popular and they're difficult to assess. Bits is neither. Everyone who saw OpenClaw's explosive growth had the exact same idea at the exact same time: "I should host this for people." When the insight is that obvious, the returns won't be.

I don't have the founders' personal stories in front of me, and that's the first thing I'd ask -- Robbie, Bailey, tell me how you got here. Not the business. How did you arrive at this moment? But what I can see from the dossier doesn't give me the biographical signal I need. Robbie went to Stanford, traded bonds at Jane Street, built AI agents at Console. Bailey did math research at Cal Poly, worked at Amazon and Metaculus, then joined Robbie at Console. These are clearly sharp technical minds -- Bailey's GitHub alone shows real systems-level fluency, from a Rust DNS client to a C container implementation. But smart credentials aren't what I'm evaluating. I'm looking for the specific hardship or obsession that makes someone the only person who could build this particular thing. What I see instead are two capable engineers who spotted a trending open-source project and moved fast. That pattern -- chasing the obvious opportunity with strong execution -- can build a solid business, but it's not the kind of founder-problem entanglement that produces the companies I write checks into.

The defensibility question is where this really falls apart for me. I've said many times that your moat is one of the first things I evaluate, even at the earliest stages. Bits is wrapping an MIT-licensed open-source project with managed hosting and a security layer. There is no proprietary model, no unique dataset, no regulatory barrier, no network effect yet. DigitalOcean and Hostinger already offer one-click OpenClaw deploys for five to fifteen dollars a month. ClawTrust has an enterprise security pedigree from a founder who built products at Palo Alto Networks and SentinelOne. LobsterTank is running Firecracker microVMs at two dollars a month. The underlying software is free, the infrastructure to host it is commodity, and the barrier to entry is a VPS and some Docker configuration. I've seen this pattern before in open-source ecosystems -- a dozen hosting companies race in, margins compress, and the project itself evolves to make self-hosting easier, which shrinks the addressable market. When OpenClaw's creator joined OpenAI and the project moved to a foundation, that could go either way -- it might create demand for managed providers, or it might mean OpenAI eventually absorbs the capability natively and the entire hosting category disappears.

Let me steelman this, though, because I owe that to any founder. The bull case requires believing three things: first, that the managed OpenClaw hosting market consolidates around one or two winners and Bits, with YC backing and a security-first positioning, becomes the default choice. Second, that OpenClaw itself becomes the dominant personal AI agent platform for the next several years, growing with the 42% CAGR agentic AI tailwind. Third, that Bits builds proprietary value on top -- accumulated user memory data, enterprise compliance certifications, a skills marketplace that creates lock-in -- and evolves from hosting into an AI agent platform company. If all three happen, this could be meaningful. The co-founders' shared experience building AI agents at Console gives them genuine domain knowledge in this space, and their prior working relationship is a real asset. But even in the bull case, I'm looking at a commoditized hosting layer on someone else's open-source project, competing with six-plus entrants who all launched in the same few weeks, with no evidence yet of the proprietary value creation that would justify venture-scale returns.

This isn't a bet I'd make with my own money. It doesn't create economic access for people who lack it. It doesn't make an invisible system visible. It doesn't operate in a hard, regulated space that deters other investors. And most fundamentally, it doesn't feel like a company born from personal conviction about an unpopular insight -- it feels like a fast follow on a consensus opportunity. The founders seem technically capable and their prior collaboration is encouraging, but capability deployed against a commodity market without a moat isn't where I find outsized returns.
