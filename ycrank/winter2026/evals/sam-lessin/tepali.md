# Tepali -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Boulevard raised $80 million in July 2025 explicitly to expand into medspas with AI features. They have 5,000 customers, $188 million in total funding, and a product roadmap that now directly targets the exact market Tepali is entering. Zenoti has $331 million raised and $174 million in annual revenue serving multi-location wellness chains. AestheticsPro is already a medspa-specific incumbent with "thousands" of users. This is the competitive context in which a two-person pre-seed team is proposing to build an "AI-native operating system for medspas." The market isn't contrarian -- it's a feeding frenzy. When Boulevard's press release cites the "Botox and GLP-1 surge" as a demand driver, that's consensus dressed in scrubs. Every investor in the room already knows medspas are growing at 15% CAGR. The opportunity is priced in.

Here's my fundamental problem: this is a textbook example of the category I've been publicly arguing is structurally broken. An AI-powered vertical SaaS platform where the AI layer is the primary claimed differentiator. Strip away the AI, and you have another medspa scheduling-CRM-charting bundle competing against well-funded incumbents who've been building these features for years. The AI doesn't make the business structurally better -- it IS the pitch. That's the opposite of "cherry on top." My test is brutally simple: would this business be compelling if AI didn't exist? The answer here is plainly no. Without the "AI-native" positioning, Tepali is a late entrant into a vertical SaaS market where the incumbents have distribution, data, and capital advantages. And the AI angle itself -- natural language querying across business data -- is commoditizing so fast that every SaaS platform will have it as a checkbox feature within eighteen months. I'd rather fund someone running actual medspas with a tech layer than a tech company building software for medspas it has never operated.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't hit my filter either. Chrisvin Jabamani is clearly smart -- PJT Partners investment banking, operations at Rilla, NYU Stern, real programming chops visible in his GitHub. That's a credible operator. But credible for what? There's no visible medspa domain expertise anywhere in the founding team's background. No clinical experience, no medspa operations, no history as a medspa owner or investor in the space. And the second co-founder, Vishnu Pathmanaban, is essentially invisible -- no public professional footprint, no LinkedIn details, no GitHub repos. For a two-person team, having half the founding bench be a black box is genuinely concerning. The "sane" part of my equation requires domain-specific credibility for the particular idea, not generic competence. A former investment banker building medspa software is a "sane person with a sane idea" -- the least interesting quadrant.

The bull case I can construct is real but doesn't overcome these structural issues. The HIPAA compliance layer creates genuine friction for horizontal salon platforms trying to move upmarket into medical aesthetics -- Vagaro and Mangomint would need to restructure their entire compliance posture to serve medspas properly. That's a real structural gap. If Tepali could establish itself as the default for independent medspa operators before Boulevard completes its expansion, switching costs from embedded patient records and treatment histories could create meaningful lock-in. And Chrisvin's experience at Rilla -- selling AI-powered vertical SaaS to fragmented SMB markets -- is directly relevant to the GTM challenge. In a world where the competitors were sleepy and the timing was five years earlier, this could work. But the competitors aren't sleepy. Boulevard is actively spending $80 million to own this exact position. The window for an underfunded insurgent to establish a beachhead before the funded armies arrive may already be closed.

There's nothing here that creates a new primitive or protocol layer. Consolidating six existing software categories into one vertical platform is application-layer work -- useful, but not the kind of foundational infrastructure that generates compounding network effects. The medspa management software TAM is roughly $300 million globally, which puts a hard ceiling on the narrative. You can stretch it to "operating system for all aesthetic medicine" or "SMB healthcare infrastructure," but those narrative expansions require beating incumbents who already have that same vision and dramatically more resources. This isn't an infinity story -- it's a market-share story in a defined, modest-sized market where the largest players have already consolidated meaningful positions.
