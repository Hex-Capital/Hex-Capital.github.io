# Autumn AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Autumn AI is that they're entering a space where consensus has already formed -- and formed loudly. "Signal-based selling" was named and popularized by well-funded companies in 2024 and 2025. Clay raised $204 million and hit a $3.1 billion valuation. 6sense raised over half a billion dollars. Common Room, Unify -- the list goes on. When I look for investments, I'm looking for ideas that other investors find confusing or ridiculous, opportunities where the founder has to explain why this isn't crazy. The tagline here is "Stalk your prospects at scale," which is memorable, but the underlying product -- monitoring public web signals to surface buying intent for sales teams -- is a well-understood capability that multiple well-capitalized companies are already building as features within broader platforms. This isn't the kind of opportunity where I get that jolt of intuitive energy. It's the kind of opportunity where I ask, "Why hasn't this already been built by the companies with hundreds of millions of dollars?"

I always start with the founder's story, not the business. Vishnu and Shiv are clearly bright -- an ISEF grand award for Alzheimer's detection, NeurIPS publications, AI research at SandboxAQ. These are impressive academic credentials from two Columbia students who are probably among the sharpest technical minds in their class. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "Tell me how you got here, not the business" -- what I'm hearing is professional exposure and academic accomplishment, not a survival story. Vishnu built sourcing technology at Sierra Ventures, which gives him genuine proximity to the problem, and that matters. But proximity through a VC internship is different from the kind of biographical connection I look for, where the founder's identity and the company's mission are inseparable. I backed Travis at Uber partly because my husband and I had spent years furious about the taxi medallion racket -- that frustration was personal and deep. I don't sense that same kind of personal wound driving Autumn AI. These founders identified a market opportunity, which is perfectly rational, but rationality isn't what makes me write a first check.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. LLMs have created a real capability shift -- parsing unstructured public data at the quality and cost needed to build this product simply wasn't feasible two years ago. The enterprise incumbents are built on cooperative third-party browsing data, which is a fundamentally different architecture than monitoring public posts, commits, and blog content in real time. There could be a disruption dynamic where 6sense and Bombora can't cannibalize their $50,000-$150,000 enterprise contracts to serve mid-market teams at a fraction of the price, the same way legacy monitoring couldn't adapt to Datadog's model. And if Vishnu and Shiv nail the signal-scoring intelligence through proprietary models that improve with usage, they could build real switching costs. The GTM intelligence market is growing at 40% CAGR. Two talented ML researchers with a focused product, YC distribution, and a lower price point than incumbents -- that's a real wedge. If I were evaluating purely on market mechanics and founder technical capability, I'd be more interested. But market mechanics and technical capability in a consensus category aren't what I invest on.

What I uniquely notice is the absence of an economic access dimension. My portfolio has a thread running through it: Uber created income for drivers who previously had none, Postmates for delivery workers, Affirm brought transparent credit to people shut out of traditional finance, Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that couldn't afford it. Autumn AI creates value for salespeople at companies that already have resources. It optimizes an existing workflow for an existing professional class. There's nothing wrong with that as a business -- it's just not the kind of company that makes me feel something. And honestly, "stalk your prospects" as a value proposition sits uncomfortably with my instinct toward companies that make opaque systems transparent in ways that empower people, not in ways that give already-resourced sales teams more leverage over their targets.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the warmest signal here. Best friends since their first day at Columbia orientation, building together as a two-person team -- that's the kind of genuine relationship foundation I've learned to value after watching HQ Trivia implode. I don't have visibility into how they handle disagreement, but friendships that predate the company are a better starting point than relationships formed around a business plan. If I were going to get excited about this company, it would start with spending time with Vishnu and Shiv, hearing them talk about each other, and understanding whether the friendship has been tested in ways that would prepare them for the pressure ahead.

Ultimately, this is a competent team building a reasonable product in a hot, crowded market. That's exactly the profile I pass on. The most promising companies are the ones nobody else wants to fund because they sound absurd. Autumn AI sounds perfectly sensible -- and in my framework, that's the problem.
