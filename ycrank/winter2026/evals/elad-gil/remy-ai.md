# Remy AI -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is the first thing I see, and it's hard to look past. Dexterity, Nimble Robotics, Covariant, and RightHand Robotics have collectively raised over $970 million, with two already at unicorn valuations. These aren't sleepy incumbents — Covariant built RFM-1, a foundation model purpose-built for robotic picking, with ABB as a distribution partner. Nimble has FedEx as a strategic partner running fulfillment-as-a-service. When I invested in Harvey, legal AI had no well-funded competitors with unicorn status. When PagerDuty was early, operations alerting was a category most investors dismissed entirely. Warehouse robotics in 2026 is neither uncrowded nor dismissed — it is a consensus-funded market with serious, well-capitalized teams already operating in production environments. A two-person pre-seed company entering this field isn't attacking a non-obvious market. It's entering one that most investors have already sized, mapped, and funded.

The "why now" argument — VLA model maturation through 2024-2025 with OpenVLA, Physical Intelligence's π0, and Gemini Robotics — is real, but it applies uniformly across the field. When a technology threshold benefits every player equally, it's a rising tide, not a structural advantage for any single entrant. Compare to how GPT-4's capability jump specifically rewarded companies that had pre-positioned with legal workflow and enterprise trust — Harvey captured that moment because the foundation model improvement compounded their existing positioning. Here, Remy AI has no accumulated deployment data, no enterprise relationships, and no operational infrastructure that would let them differentially benefit from VLA improvements. Covariant and Dexterity have more warehouse data, more compute, more deployment experience. The improving models make their existing products better, not Remy's hypothetical one.

The brownfield angle targeting the 80% of unautomated warehouses is the most interesting element of the pitch, and I want to give it a fair hearing. There's a pattern I've seen work before — Gusto targeted the SMBs that ADP wouldn't serve, Stripe targeted the developers that PayPal's checkout flow couldn't reach. If Remy AI is genuinely building for a customer segment that Dexterity and Nimble structurally cannot serve — because their sales processes, pricing, and deployment models are optimized for large facilities — that could be a real market. The 70,000 US-based 3PL providers that have never automated represent a potentially large, underserved segment. The structural barrier would be that incumbents' unit economics prevent them from moving downmarket, the same way Oracle's sales model prevented them from serving small businesses even when they had better technology than early Salesforce. If that structural barrier holds, Remy AI could own a segment the incumbents can't efficiently address.

But here's where the analogy breaks down: Gusto and Stripe are pure software companies with software margin structures. Remy AI builds and deploys physical robots. Every new customer requires manufacturing, shipping, installing, and maintaining hardware in a demanding warehouse environment. The cost floor is dominated by atoms, not bits. Achieving "50% lower cost" through a different training pipeline is implausible when hardware, field service, and deployment logistics are the primary cost drivers. This looks more like a "software-aware" business than a "software-driven" one — remove the VLA model and you still have a robotics company with all the capital intensity, margin compression, and scaling friction that entails. A smarter robot is still a robot.

The multi-miracle problem is severe. For Remy AI to succeed, they need: (1) VLA model performance reliable enough for diverse warehouse products and environments, (2) affordable hardware that survives demanding industrial conditions, (3) a manufacturing and supply chain operation, (4) field deployment and maintenance capability, and (5) enterprise sales into cost-sensitive 3PLs. That's four or five sequential breakthroughs, each with meaningful failure probability. I explicitly avoid companies where success requires compounding low-probability events. The founding team has relevant backgrounds — Ben Kaye's CVPR 2025 publication in 3D vision is a genuine technical credential, and Oscar Brisset's BCG X logistics consulting provides domain exposure — but neither has built and shipped a physical product, run a hardware manufacturing operation, or sold to enterprise logistics customers. There's no evidence of a working prototype, pilot deployment, or customer conversations.

On the technology cycle specifically, I'll note that the VLA wave is real and the timing of 2025-2026 for warehouse manipulation capability is plausible. But being at the right moment in an adoption curve only matters if you can capture the moment — and capturing it in hardware robotics requires capital, manufacturing expertise, and deployment infrastructure that a pre-seed team cannot conjure through execution speed alone. Harvey could position ahead of the GPT-4 curve because building legal workflows is a software problem. Positioning ahead of the VLA curve in warehouse robotics requires robots in warehouses, which requires everything I described above.
