# Balance -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Balance: this is one of the most popular categories in startup investing right now. AI-powered accounting has attracted hundreds of millions in venture capital over the past two years -- Digits at $97M, Pilot at $222M-plus, Zeni at $51M, Docyt at $35M, Truewind at $17M. Every one of these companies launched an AI agent product in 2025. When I look at a market where that many well-funded teams are racing toward the same thesis, my instinct isn't excitement -- it's caution. The most promising companies are the ones that nobody else wants to fund, the ones where investors look at you sideways when you describe the opportunity. AI accounting in 2026 is the opposite of that. This is a crowded, well-understood, consensus bet, and that's the hardest thing for me to get past.

When I think about the founders, I want to hear about the journey that led them here -- not the business rationale, but the personal thread. Mathias Løvring was a CFO at Female Invest and founded an accountancy practice, and he describes chasing external accountants, correcting their mistakes, spending hours on manual processes. I believe that frustration is real. But professional frustration is different from the kind of biographical commitment I look for. There's no survival story here, no moment where this problem became existential for the founder. Compare that to how I felt when I heard the Crusoe founders explain why they were in North Dakota trying to turn flared gas into computation -- their whole lives had led to that specific weird insight. Mathias understands the problem intellectually and professionally, and that matters, but it doesn't give me that visceral sense that he's the only person on earth who could solve it. Gus brings strong AI credentials from Oxford and Imperial, and the jockey-turned-researcher backstory is genuinely colorful, but it doesn't connect to accounting in any way I can trace. Emil's McKinsey-plus-YC-companies path is polished and capable -- and "polished and capable" is exactly the profile that tells me less about what happens when everything goes wrong.

The bull case deserves serious engagement, because the timing argument is compelling. Bench -- the closest operational precedent to what Balance is building -- raised $113M and then imploded in December 2024, stranding 35,000-plus customers overnight. That created a vacuum and simultaneously proved that the human-heavy managed bookkeeping model breaks at scale. If you believe that AI has crossed the accuracy threshold for financial document processing in 2024-2025, then the argument writes itself: do what Bench did, but with AI handling 80-90% of the work and humans reviewing only the output. That's a fundamentally different cost structure. And the incumbents -- Big Four firms, mid-tier practices -- are structurally trapped by their billable-hour revenue models, making it genuinely difficult for them to adopt flat-rate AI-first pricing without cannibalizing their own business. If Balance can nail accuracy and keep the human review layer thin enough to maintain real margins, the $688B accounting services market is genuinely enormous. There's a version of this company that works.

But that version requires winning an execution race against teams with twenty to sixty times more capital, in a category where the underlying AI capabilities -- LLM-powered categorization, reconciliation, document understanding -- are widely available and rapidly commoditizing. When the technology risk is low and the market is obvious, what you're left with is an execution bet. And execution bets in crowded markets aren't where I've built my track record. I backed SpaceX because private space was considered insane. I backed Uber because ride-sharing was illegal. I invested in Contraline because male contraception was so stigmatized that VCs wouldn't even take the meeting. The pattern that's worked for me is finding founders with deep personal conviction operating in spaces that repel other investors -- and then the lack of competition becomes the moat. Balance is operating in a space that attracts investors, and the brand confusion with another well-funded fintech company called Balance (the B2B payments startup at getbalance.com with $350M in debt financing) suggests the positioning challenges that come with entering a crowded field. The economic access dimension is real -- flat-rate accounting could genuinely help small businesses that get poor service from overpriced accountants -- and I appreciate that. But cheaper accounting is an incremental improvement to an existing service, not the kind of structural transparency I've been drawn to with companies like Carta or Affirm that revealed hidden information for the first time. I respect what this team is building, but this isn't my kind of bet.
