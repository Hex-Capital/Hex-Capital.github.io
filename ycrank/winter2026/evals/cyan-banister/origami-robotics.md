# Origami Robotics -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Origami Robotics, and it's the thing that would keep me from leaning in at the table: this is a consensus bet dressed in a contrarian outfit. Physical AI and dexterous manipulation are arguably the single hottest category in venture capital right now. Physical Intelligence has raised $1.1 billion. Figure AI is valued at $39 billion. Every fund in Silicon Valley is scrambling to write checks into robotics. When I invested in SpaceX, private space was considered delusional. When I backed Uber, ride-sharing was illegal in most cities. The most promising companies are not popular -- and this category is extremely popular. The specific technical approach Origami takes, the matched hardware co-design, is a clever engineering insight, but it lives inside a market where the world's most well-capitalized startups and research labs are all converging on the same general problem. That's a very different risk profile than the ones I'm drawn to.

The founder story here is one of academic excellence, not biographical grit. Daniel Xie is doing his PhD at CMU's Robotics Institute, publishing papers on exactly the embodiment gap problem the company addresses, and his research record is genuinely strong -- oral presentation at WACV in the top 2%, papers in RA-L, work on foundation models for robotics. Ryan Xie has prior hardware startup experience with Ground Robotics and practical robotics engineering from Canvas Construction. These are smart, capable people. But when I sit across from a founder, the first thing I want to hear is the story that explains why this problem chose them -- not why they chose this problem. The path here is RPI undergrad, top graduate programs, research lab, commercialize the thesis. It's a well-worn and respectable path, but it's not the kind of biographical urgency that tells me this person will survive the three or four near-death moments every startup faces. The fact that Ryan's LinkedIn still lists Ground Robotics and Daniel may still be enrolled in his PhD program adds a layer of ambiguity about full commitment that I'd want to probe hard.

I want to be fair about the bull case, because there's a real one. The co-designed hardware approach -- building matched data-collection gloves and robot hands so there's zero embodiment gap -- is a genuinely differentiated technical insight. While everyone else is either trying to brute-force simulation-to-real transfer or building expensive full humanoid bodies, Origami is saying the problem is fundamentally about hardware matching, and they're solving it at the right layer. If that insight proves correct, they could be the hands that plug into everyone else's arms and bodies. The "narrow wedge" strategy of focusing only on hands is capital-efficient compared to Figure or Sanctuary building entire humanoids. And the data flywheel concept -- deploy paired devices into factories, collect proprietary manipulation data, train models, sell automation back -- has the potential to create a compounding moat if they can get the first dozen deployments. If Daniel and Ryan are brothers, which the shared surname and shared alma mater suggest, that would actually map to something I care deeply about: family-run businesses with proven conflict resolution. For this to work, everything would need to break right on timing, the data flywheel would need to spin up before the billion-dollar competitors solve the embodiment gap through sheer compute, and the founders would need to fully commit and outrun organizations with hundred-to-one resource advantages.

What's missing for me is the economic access dimension. My best investments -- Uber, Postmates, Affirm, Thumbtack -- create new economic opportunity for people who didn't have it before. They make invisible systems visible and put money in the pockets of working people. Industrial automation for manufacturing and logistics does the opposite: it replaces human labor. There's a legitimate labor shortage argument, and I don't dismiss it, but I can't get excited about a company the way I do when I can see how it lifts people up economically. The company's narrative is about efficiency and capability, not about access or transparency. That's fine for other investors -- it's just not where I feel that jolt of intuitive energy.

The hard-space dimension is where Origami actually earns some of my respect. Hardware robotics is genuinely difficult, capital-intensive, and unforgiving in ways that software founders never have to confront. Actuator design, manufacturing tolerances, supply chain complexity, the brutal physics of real-world manipulation -- these are hard problems that create real barriers. But the difficulty here is engineering difficulty, not regulatory or stigma-based complexity. When I backed Contraline or Mindbloom, the moat wasn't just technical -- it was that other investors were afraid of the category itself. Nobody is afraid of robotics right now. They're throwing money at it.

This is a pass for me. Not because the founders aren't talented or the technology isn't real -- both are solid -- but because nothing about this company activates my core investment instincts. It's a credentialed team in a hot category with a clever technical differentiator, and there are probably a dozen funds that would be delighted to write this check. I'm not one of them. I'm looking for the deals that make people uncomfortable, that nobody else wants, that come from founders whose life story and company mission are the same sentence. Origami Robotics is a perfectly reasonable company for a different kind of investor.
