# Skillsync -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Let me start with what's most revealing about Skillsync: the product positioning shifted from "Discover hidden talent in your codebase" — an internal analytics tool — to "Find anyone in open source" — an external recruiting tool. That pivot between a June 2025 Product Hunt launch and the YC W26 batch tells me the founders haven't yet converged on which problem they're solving. But more fundamentally, both versions of the problem converge on the same consequence: making it somewhat easier for companies to hire engineers. That's the ceiling. Whether I'm evaluating the internal version or the external version, if Skillsync succeeds completely — captures every dollar of code-based developer sourcing — the world has slightly better recruiting tooling. No industry becomes obsolete. No trillion-dollar system gets restructured. Hiring gets incrementally more efficient for a subset of technical roles.

This is the archetype of what I walk away from. The founders have found a real pain point — specialized engineers are invisible on LinkedIn, and their skills live in code rather than resumes. True. But they've scoped their ambition to a feature-sized problem inside a mature industry. The recruitment software market is $2-3 billion growing at 5-9% annually. That's not an exponential curve; that's a commodity market with established players. SeekOut has $189 million in funding and indexes 700 million profiles. HireEZ, Entelo, and Turing all occupy adjacent positions. Skillsync's differentiation — analyzing code rather than profiles — is real but narrow, and critically, it's technically reproducible. The dossier itself acknowledges this: GitHub's public API provides the same raw data, and LLMs have made code understanding broadly accessible. LinkedIn, which sits inside Microsoft alongside GitHub, could build this as a feature without breaking a sweat. When your differentiation is a layer of AI analysis on publicly available data that any well-funded competitor can replicate, you haven't built disruption — you've built a temporary head start.

The founders have genuine domain knowledge worth acknowledging. Both came from Juspay, where they helped grow Hyperswitch from launch to 20,000+ GitHub stars, managing a community of hundreds of open-source contributors. They experienced the problem of identifying skilled contributors firsthand. Narayana brings product sensibility; Nishant is a serious Rust engineer with real open-source credibility (shelgon at 271 stars, active contributor to a 40K-star repo). This is legitimate founder-market fit. But here's what I notice that a generalist investor might not: these are insiders building an insider's tool. They know what's possible because they lived inside the open-source community. That's the kind of domain expertise that produces competent execution and reasonable businesses — not the kind of outsider naiveté that produces Juniper Networks or Impossible Foods. Nobody told them this was impossible. Nobody laughed. The experts aren't dismissing code-based sourcing; they just haven't prioritized it. That's a market signal, not a contrarian signal.

The bull case requires believing that code-based identity becomes a foundational layer — that Skillsync isn't a recruiting tool but the beginning of a new professional identity infrastructure where what you've built replaces what you've listed on a resume. If code-contribution analysis becomes the primary signal for developer capability across the entire hiring ecosystem, and Skillsync's skill taxonomy and profile depth compound into an irreplicable data asset, then the consequence grows considerably. The LLM timing angle is genuine — parsing code semantics at scale simply wasn't feasible three years ago, and Skillsync is early to applying this capability to talent identification. That's a favorable technology trajectory. But even this optimistic version caps out at reforming how one profession gets hired, not at transforming how an industry or system operates. The maximum ambition I can construct from the evidence is "better LinkedIn for developers" — and that's not a problem too important not to work on.

The pricing structure tells the story: $499 per month per seat, $3 per deep profile credit, an enterprise tier with custom integrations. This is a SaaS business with predictable unit economics selling to recruiters. It's designed to reduce the probability of failure — manageable niche, proven business model, clear buyer persona. And in doing so, the founders have ensured that the consequences of success are, from where I sit, inconsequential. These two are smart enough and technically capable enough to attempt something that would make me uncomfortable. Instead, they've built a better search bar for recruiters. I'd tell them what I tell every team in this position: you're too capable to spend your careers on a problem this contained. Go find the version of this idea that terrifies LinkedIn into restructuring.
