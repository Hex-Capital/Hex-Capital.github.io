# Ruma Care -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the competitive landscape, and what it tells me about timing. CoverMyMeds was acquired for $1.1B in 2017. Cohere Health has raised $200M. Infinitus has $103M. Waystar is public. Infinx does $170M in revenue. And the CMS just mandated faster prior authorization processing starting January 2026. When the government passes a rule saying "fix this," and five well-capitalized companies are already building in the space, you are not contrarian. You are late-consensus. The biologics-specific niche is a reasonable wedge, but "go narrow where the incumbents are broad" is strategy, not insight. Every vertical SaaS pitch makes that argument. The real question is whether the niche is defensible long enough to compound, or whether it's a feature that Waystar ships in a quarter.

Now, the specific knowledge question. Meng Fei Shen worked as a Medical Assistant at San Mateo Rheumatology -- an infusion clinic, the exact customer type. That's real. She sat with the forms, made the phone calls, watched patients get denied. That experience gave her pattern recognition about the workflow that a product manager doing customer discovery interviews wouldn't have. But a Medical Assistant stint is operational exposure, not decade-deep domain knowledge. Compare this to what I look for: someone who has been thinking about this problem space so long that they see structural dynamics invisible to outsiders. The CEO's career path -- East Asian Studies at Yale, Uber PM, Walmart Data Ventures, then a stint as an MA -- reads more like deliberate problem-discovery than accumulated specific knowledge. It's smart and resourceful, but it's the kind of insight you could acquire in six months of embedded work. The CTO's profile is stronger for this particular problem: ML engineering at Apple combined with healthcare payer integrations at Medallion gives her a rare intersection of technical capability and domain-specific systems knowledge. That combination is harder to hire for.

The leverage architecture is where this company loses me. Ruma Care automates prior authorizations. It makes clinic staff 20x faster at filling out forms. That's valuable -- the $720K-$4.8M in annual at-risk revenue per practice means the ROI story practically tells itself. But automation is not leverage in the sense I mean. Leverage creates a new capability that didn't exist before. AngelList didn't make fundraising faster -- it created a new way for individuals to deploy capital into startups. Replit didn't make coding faster -- it enabled people who couldn't code to build software. Ruma Care makes an existing bureaucratic process less painful. Important? Yes. A new form of leverage? No. Each new clinic is a customer to onboard, not a node that makes the network more valuable. The denial-pattern data flywheel adds a compounding element, but it's narrow -- it optimizes one workflow for one medication category, not a platform that other products build on top of.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. The financial pain in buy-and-bill is severe and quantifiable -- a rheumatology practice absorbing $2,000-$8,000 per denied infusion, 30-50 times a month, is bleeding cash. A 50% reduction in denial rates, if sustained and verifiable, translates to hundreds of thousands in recovered revenue per clinic per year. That's not a vitamin, that's a tourniquet. The biologics niche is also structurally underserved: CoverMyMeds monetizes through pharma companies, Cohere is payer-aligned, Infinitus does phone calls not forms, and Waystar is too broad to care about the specific documentation requirements for each medication-diagnosis-payer combination. If Ruma can lock in enough infusion clinics before an incumbent decides to specialize, the switching costs from workflow integration and accumulated denial-pattern data could hold. And the expansion path from rheumatology biologics to oncology and neurology specialty drugs is natural. If everything breaks right, this is a $100M+ vertical SaaS company.

But "if everything breaks right" is not how I underwrite angel investments. I'm looking for asymmetric upside -- the kind where being right early produces 100x or 1000x, not 10x. A well-executed vertical SaaS company in healthcare PA automation is a solid business, maybe a good private equity return. It's not a leverage-creating platform that compounds into something qualitatively new. The technology -- LLM-based form extraction, criteria matching, form-filling -- is technically reproducible by any team with competent ML engineers and healthcare domain knowledge. The data moat takes time to build but isn't protected by physics or network topology. And the regulatory tailwind that creates urgency today could become a headwind tomorrow if payers actually streamline PA requirements for biologics, shrinking the problem Ruma exists to solve.

This is a competent team with real domain exposure building a useful tool in a market with genuine pain. I respect the hustle of going to work as an MA to understand the problem firsthand. But I invest in companies that create new categories of capability, not ones that optimize existing workflows. The timing is consensus, the leverage is linear, and the technology doesn't compound in a way that makes it qualitatively harder to compete with over time. I'd wish them well and watch from a distance.
