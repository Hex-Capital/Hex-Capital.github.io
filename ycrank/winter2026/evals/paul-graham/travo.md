# Travo -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first question I always ask is: how did they find this problem? Four Stanford CS undergrads -- backgrounds in edtech, aerospace software, law, and Roblox -- building a data platform for RV park investors. I've looked through every piece of information in this dossier and I cannot find the thread. Nobody on this team has worked in real estate. Nobody appears to have invested in an RV park, managed one, or tried to buy one and gotten frustrated by the data. The most likely story is that someone analyzed the CRE data market, noticed that CoStar and Reonomy don't cover niche asset classes, and said "there's a gap." That's market research, not organic discovery. It's the difference between Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive and a team sitting in a room saying "cloud storage is underserved."

The gap they identified is real. RV park ownership is fragmented -- 90% of parks owned by operators with fewer than five properties -- and the data really is scattered across county records and zoning maps. But the fact that a gap exists doesn't mean the founders were the ones who should fill it. The schlep here is data aggregation: scraping county assessors, parsing zoning databases, normalizing rental listings. That's tedious engineering work, but it's not the kind of schlep that produces what I call schlep blindness. Nobody is unconsciously avoiding this because it's frightening. They're avoiding it because the market for data tools serving RV park investors might be too small to bother. When Stripe went after payment processing, every programmer knew it was broken but nobody wanted to deal with banks and regulators. That's schlep blindness. When nobody builds data tools for a $10.9 billion niche industry, the more likely explanation is that the addressable market for those tools is thin, not that everyone is scared.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. CoStar started with one city and one property type and became worth $30 billion. If Travo nails RV parks and expands to mobile home parks, self-storage, marinas, and campgrounds -- the entire long tail of alternative commercial real estate -- the opportunity grows substantially. Institutional capital has been flowing into alternative assets as mainstream CRE yields compress, which means the buyer base for this data is growing. And the team has real technical credentials: Dalva did ML fault-resilience research and wrote satellite software, Sriram built backend systems at Roblox and an edtech company with millions of users. Chen has a prior exit, even if the details are opaque. Calafiura worked at Wachtell Lipton, which is not a place that hires people who aren't extremely capable. If they develop deep domain expertise through sheer intensity of execution -- the way Tony Xu at DoorDash learned logistics by personally delivering food -- they could overcome the organic-origin deficit. The data asset itself compounds: every month of collection widens the moat against anyone starting from scratch.

But I keep coming back to the origin. The strongest startups are built by people who couldn't stop thinking about the problem before they started the company. The founders here could have built a real estate data platform or an edtech platform or a developer tool -- the idea seems chosen, not inevitable. And the niche-first strategy, while defensible as a wedge, has a ceiling problem. The U.S. RV park industry is $10.9 billion in total revenue. The addressable market for data services to investors in that segment is some fraction of a fraction of that. Until they prove they can expand to other niche asset classes at comparable quality, this looks like a small market with a plausible but unproven expansion story.

On the technical side, the credentials are strong on paper but the evidence of building is thin. The CTO has two public repos on GitHub with roughly one star. For a company whose core product is AI-powered data collection and analysis, I'd want to see more visible technical output -- a working prototype, an interesting open-source project, something that shows these specific founders building this specific kind of system. The team has the raw ability. What I can't see is whether they've directed it toward this problem with the kind of intensity that produces something real. Zero traction signals -- no revenue, no users, no waitlist, no named customers -- makes it impossible to evaluate whether they've built anything people want. At pre-seed that's normal, but combined with the manufactured-idea concern and the absent domain expertise, it leaves me without a single concrete signal to anchor conviction on.

This is the pattern I've described before: brilliant people working on something they discovered through analysis rather than necessity. The market gap is real. The team is capable. But capability applied to a chosen problem is less powerful than capability applied to a problem you've been living with for years. I'd want to see evidence that at least one founder has gone deep into the RV park investment world -- spent months talking to park operators, sat in on deals, understood the specific pain of manually assembling comps from county records. If that happened and I just can't see it from public information, this could be a different evaluation. But based on what's visible, this is a pass.
