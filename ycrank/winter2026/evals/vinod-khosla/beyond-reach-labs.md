# Beyond Reach Labs -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The thing that immediately activates my framework here is the Redwire problem -- and I mean Redwire's problem, not Beyond Reach Labs'. Redwire has $304 million in revenue, roughly 60% market share in deployable space structures, and their entire business is built around ROSA roll-out blanket architecture. Now here come two guys from Pittsburgh with a scissor-truss design that claims 10x more usable power at the same launch mass. This is the Juniper-Cisco dynamic all over again. Cisco's CTO told me they would never build a TCP/IP router. Redwire is similarly locked into an architecture that trades structural rigidity for deployability at scale -- and they cannot adopt a fundamentally different geometry without cannibalizing the product line they've spent years qualifying. When an incumbent has to choose between protecting today's revenue and chasing tomorrow's architecture, they almost always choose today. That structural paralysis is where outsiders win.

The consequence of success here is conditional, and I want to be honest about that. If you take the current space solar array market -- $635 million, growing to maybe $3 billion by 2033 -- success means a solid business, not a world-altering one. But that's the wrong framing. In January 2026, SpaceX filed for a million-satellite orbital AI datacenter constellation. In February, Starcloud filed for 88,000 orbital datacenter satellites requiring 5 GW. Google announced Project Suncatcher. The projected power demand in orbit goes from 20 MW today to 10 GW or more. If that demand materializes, the market for deployable solar arrays isn't $3 billion -- it's something nobody has accurately estimated, because the estimates predate the orbital datacenter wave entirely. This is like estimating the market for routers in 1992 before anyone understood what internet traffic would look like. Power is THE constraint in space. Everything -- orbital computing, commercial stations, lunar outposts -- gates on power. If Beyond Reach Labs becomes the standard power architecture for space industrialization, the consequence of success is enabling an entire frontier. That's worth a bet even at high failure probability. But the conditionality is real: if orbital datacenters prove uneconomic, this contracts back to a respectable niche business fighting Redwire for share in a modest market.

The founders are not the classic outsiders I usually gravitate toward -- they're deeply credentialed in exactly this domain. Fogelson's PhD is literally in deployable space structures and mechanical metamaterials, conducted under a NASA NIAC grant with zero-gravity flight validation. Collins spent seven years at SpaceX and led the design of Crew Dragon parachutes that brought NASA astronauts home from the ISS -- that's human-rated flight hardware, the highest bar in aerospace engineering. They're outsiders to the incumbent deployable structures *industry* (Redwire, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris), but insiders to the underlying engineering disciplines. I'd normally worry that this kind of domain expertise constrains ambition, but the 20:1 extension ratio and football-field-scale arrays suggest they haven't limited their imagination to what Redwire considers feasible. The fact that the technology originated in academic research rather than corporate R&D is a positive signal -- academic labs tend to explore solution spaces that industry ignores because they don't fit existing product lines.

The timing trajectory is the strongest dimension of this investment. They built the technology before the demand wave arrived. The orbital datacenter announcements of early 2026 created a power demand in space that is orders of magnitude beyond what anyone projected two years ago, and Beyond Reach Labs had already developed and begun validating the deployable architecture that could serve it. That's the Gretzky principle -- skating to where the puck will be. The rate of change in space power demand is exponential, driven by the convergence of declining launch costs, AI compute demand pushing into orbit, and commercial space station development. They're positioned ahead of an accelerating curve that hasn't reached mainstream awareness among most investors. The $175M+ in LOIs from multiple space companies, while non-binding, signal that potential customers already recognize the power constraint and are actively seeking solutions beyond what Redwire offers.

The risk I weigh most heavily is flight heritage. This technology has been tested in parabolic flights but has never operated in orbit. Thermal cycling between -150°C and +150°C, atomic oxygen erosion, radiation degradation of mechanisms, micrometeoroid impacts on deployed trusses -- these are brutal failure modes that cannot be fully replicated on the ground. The Q2 2027 in-space demonstration is the single most critical de-risking event. If that succeeds, the patent-pending architecture gains mission heritage that creates a real barrier to competitors. If it fails or slips significantly, the $175M LOI pipeline evaporates. This is exactly the kind of binary, option-value bet I structure my portfolio around -- the money either expires or you build something transformational. At a pre-seed check size, the downside is bounded and the upside, if orbital power demand follows its current trajectory, is enormous.

For a two-person team, the gene pool is well-engineered. One founder owns the core technology risk, the other owns the manufacturing and qualification risk. Their advisory board -- an AFRL Chief Scientist with 25 years of space vehicle experience and an MIT professor who co-advised Fogelson's PhD -- directly addresses the government procurement and continued technology development risks. They'll need to recruit aggressively to reach production, but they've correctly identified the two most critical competencies for the founding team. I'd want to see them bring on a business development lead with deep DoD and NASA procurement experience as their first key hire.
