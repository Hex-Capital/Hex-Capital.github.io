# Luel -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Luel is what's missing from the story: how did these founders find this problem? The dossier gives me a market thesis — AI training data is growing at 22% CAGR, lawsuits are making rights clearance urgent, Scale AI's Meta acquisition opened a neutrality gap. All true. All the kind of thing you'd write on a whiteboard during a brainstorming session at Berkeley. What I don't see is the moment. Drew Houston forgot his USB drive. The Collisons tried to accept a payment online and nearly threw their laptop across the room. Somewhere in the founding story of every great company is a specific, concrete encounter with a broken thing. Namgyal was a founding engineer twice and Lenderking was an ML researcher — either of those backgrounds *could* have led to a painful collision with data sourcing. But the dossier tells me nothing about whether it did. And in my experience, when the organic origin exists, founders can't stop talking about it. When it's absent from every public surface — the YC page, the website, LinkedIn — that's because it probably doesn't exist.

The schlep here is real but visible. Rights clearance, contributor management, consent documentation, chain-of-title verification — these are genuinely tedious problems that deter lazy founders. I'll give Luel credit for that. But schlep blindness is about problems hiding in plain sight because the unconscious filters them out. This problem isn't hidden. Protege raised $65 million to attack adjacent territory. Mercor is at a $10 billion valuation with $450 million in annualized revenue. Surge AI bootstrapped to $1.4 billion in revenue. The pain of AI training data sourcing is one of the most widely discussed problems in the industry right now. When I invested in Stripe, every programmer knew payments were broken but the Collisons were nearly alone in walking into the banks. Luel is entering a room that's already crowded.

The strongest bull case is the structural opening from Scale AI's compromised neutrality. When Meta effectively acquired Scale for $14.3 billion, Google and OpenAI reportedly cut ties. That's a genuine market dislocation — the dominant vendor suddenly became conflicted, and frontier labs need alternatives. If Luel could position itself as the neutral, rights-first data marketplace at exactly the moment the incumbents are distracted or compromised, there's a real window. The contributor-driven model for *creating* new multimodal data on demand is also genuinely different from what Scale, Surge, and Mercor do — those companies focus on labeling or expert annotation of existing data, not mobilizing everyday people to produce fresh video, audio, and images to specification. If this distinction matters to buyers, and if the marketplace can build supply liquidity before well-funded competitors pivot into the same lane, Luel could win a meaningful niche. The claimed backing from xAI, Meta, and Mercor — if true — would represent extraordinary customer-investor alignment. But "if true" is doing a lot of work in that sentence, since the dossier found no independent confirmation.

On the founders: two Berkeley dropouts, team of two, $500K. Namgyal's "2x founding engineer" experience is a positive signal — he's built things at startups before. But I can't find evidence that either founder is the kind of technical animal who stays up all night writing code because they can't stop. Namgyal's public GitHub shows a student research project. Lenderking is titled COO and has no visible public repos. For a company that needs to build a sophisticated two-sided marketplace with quality control systems, rights verification infrastructure, and multimodal data processing pipelines, I'd want to see stronger evidence that the technical foundations are being laid by the people in the room, not planned for future hires.

The absence of any traction signal concerns me. No revenue, no user counts, no contributor counts, no growth metrics, no press. A contributor balance of $128.40 displayed on the website is the only tangible evidence the platform is operational, and even that could be a mockup. At pre-seed I don't expect much, but I expect *something* — a handful of contributors who are excited, an AI lab that signed an LOI, a pilot dataset that someone paid for. The complete absence of any demand signal, combined with an idea that reads as market-analysis-driven rather than organic, puts this squarely in territory I've learned to avoid. Smart people, logical thesis, no evidence anyone is pulling the product toward them.

I keep coming back to the competitive dynamics. Luel has $500K. Mercor has $350 million. Protege has $65 million and a16z behind it. Surge AI has $1.4 billion in revenue and zero outside funding — they're the most capital-efficient company in the space. Any of these could expand into rights-cleared multimodal data collection within months. The marketplace model for data collection is replicable. The switching costs for enterprise buyers between data vendors are low for commodity datasets. Luel would need to build supply-side liquidity so fast that it becomes the default before anyone else moves — and I see no evidence of the kind of intense, unscalable user acquisition (knocking on doors, personally recruiting contributors, hand-delivering datasets to labs) that would give me confidence they can do that. This is a category where execution speed against well-capitalized incumbents is existential, and nothing in the dossier tells me these founders are operating at the required velocity.
