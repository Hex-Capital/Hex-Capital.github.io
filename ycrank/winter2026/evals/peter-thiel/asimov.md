# Asimov -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of Asimov is not what it is building but who else is building the same thing. Scale AI -- a company valued at $29 billion with $870 million in 2024 revenue -- launched its Physical AI data collection division in 2025 and already serves leading robotics labs including Physical Intelligence and Generalist AI. Cortex AI, a YC F25 company founded by the co-founder of Carousell (a billion-dollar exit), operates a nearly identical workplace data marketplace. Sensei, YC S24, attacks the same problem through sensorized exoskeletons. The Chinese government has funded 40 dedicated training centers to address the robotics data shortage. When a pre-seed startup, a $29 billion incumbent, multiple YC cohortmates, and a foreign government are all racing toward the same thesis simultaneously, there is no secret. There is a consensus observation dressed in startup clothing. "Robots need training data" is not a contrarian truth that most intelligent people reject -- it is the single most obvious bottleneck in embodied AI, visible to every investor, every robotics lab, and every government ministry paying attention. The Girardian dynamics are textbook: companies imitating each other into the same market, differentiating only on the minor details of their collection hardware while sharing an identical thesis about the world.

The secret test is the first thing I apply, and Asimov fails it decisively. The closest thing to a non-consensus insight here is the claim that organic egocentric human activity data -- captured through headband cameras during unscripted daily life -- is qualitatively superior for robot training compared to scripted laboratory demonstrations. That is a defensible product hypothesis, but it is not a secret in the relevant sense. It is a design choice. No serious robotics researcher would argue against the value of diverse, naturalistic training data; the question is only whether it is worth the quality control headaches of distributed collection. This is an operational trade-off, not a hidden truth about how the world works. PayPal's secret was that email could replace wire transfers. Palantir's secret was that commercial anti-fraud algorithms could transform intelligence analysis. "People doing everyday tasks produce useful training data for robots" is not in the same category. It is an observation anyone with a passing familiarity with machine learning would make.

The technology compounds the problem. A lightweight headband camera is commodity hardware. The annotation pipeline -- 3D body pose estimation, depth maps, semantic labeling, activity segmentation -- uses well-established computer vision techniques. Nothing in this stack is proprietary, novel, or difficult to replicate. This is a logistics and operations business, not a technology company. The distinction matters because logistics businesses compete on execution and price, not on structural advantages that compound over time. Scale AI could deploy identical headband cameras to its existing contractor network within months if it chose to. The 5,000-contributor network spanning three continents is an operational accomplishment for a pre-seed company, but it is not a moat -- contributors face zero switching costs and will work for whoever pays the highest rate. This is "1 to n" work: applying existing camera and annotation technology to a new domain. It does not create something that did not previously exist.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. If humanoid robotics achieves the deployment trajectory that Figure AI's $39 billion valuation and Tesla's Optimus program imply, the demand for training data will be enormous and sustained. The $6.75 billion projected market by 2031 may prove conservative. Asimov's unit economics -- paying contributors $20-30 per hour while the market rate for quality robot training data is $100-500 per hour -- suggest meaningful margins if quality can be maintained at scale. And there is a timing argument: the company that builds the largest, most geographically diverse contributor network first may create a supply-side advantage that takes competitors years to replicate, even if the technology itself is commodity. If Asimov locked in exclusive data supply agreements with the two or three leading robotics labs before Scale AI's physical AI division scaled, it could establish a position that is difficult to dislodge. The Stripe analogy would be: own the infrastructure layer that every robotics company depends on, making switching costs high through deep integration. But this analogy breaks because Stripe's developer API was a genuine 10x improvement over existing payment integration -- it was technically superior in a way that headband cameras are not technically superior to any other camera worn on a head.

The founder profile does not overcome these structural concerns. Lyem Ningthou is a recent UC Berkeley CS graduate with experience at several early-stage startups and NSF-funded AI research, but the dossier reveals no deep robotics domain expertise, no published research in embodied AI, no prior exit, and no evidence of the kind of definite conviction that characterizes the founders I back. The YC bio describes him as a "defense tech robotics researcher," but no confirming publications or institutional affiliations support this claim. I look for founders who have a specific, concrete vision of the future their company creates and who have already refused easier paths in service of that vision. Nothing in the available evidence suggests that level of intellectual depth or conviction. A solo-listed founder managing hardware logistics across three continents with a team of three is operationally ambitious, but ambition without a secret is just hard work in a competitive market -- and hard work does not produce monopoly returns.

This is a company solving a real problem in a growing market. But it is solving the same problem that everyone else can see, using technology that everyone else can build, in a market where a $29 billion incumbent has already arrived. The absence of a contrarian thesis, the commodity nature of the technology, and the crowded competitive landscape make this a clear pass. The data collection business for robotics may prove large and important, but the company that wins it will need either a genuine technological discontinuity or the kind of supply-side lock-in that takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to build -- and Scale AI starts with both more time and more capital.
