# Martini -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately about Martini: the founders have built what appears to be a genuinely well-designed product -- a collaborative workspace for AI filmmaking with real cinematography controls, multi-model routing, and professional NLE export. 200+ films created. A Cannes-screened cinematographer at the helm. Press coverage. A clean pricing page. And my first question isn't "does it work?" but "if it works perfectly, so what?" The consequence of success here is that professional filmmakers have a nicer interface for accessing other companies' AI models. The cited TAM is $3.24 billion for "AI in filmmaking" -- a rounding error against the industries I care about. If Martini captures this entire market, which it won't, the result is a solid mid-tier SaaS company. Nobody's life changes. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The film industry's fundamental structure -- studios, distribution, talent economics -- remains untouched. This is a workflow improvement masquerading as a revolution.

The structural problem runs deeper than market size. Martini has explicitly chosen to be an orchestration layer -- it does not train its own models, it routes requests to Veo 3, Kling, Sora, Runway Gen-4. The company sits between commodity inputs (third-party AI models available via API) and commodity outputs (standard video files). This is the thinnest possible position in the value chain. When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu was building the router -- not a dashboard that let you choose between Cisco's and Bay Networks' routers. When I backed Square, Jack Dorsey was building the payment system -- not an interface that routed transactions to whichever payment processor was cheapest. The disruptive value in AI filmmaking will accrue to whoever builds the model that generates feature-film-quality video from a director's intent. Martini is building a nice front-end for someone else's disruption. That's a fundamentally different risk-reward proposition, and it's the opposite of what I invest in.

The competitive encirclement alone should give anyone pause. Runway has raised $860M and is targeting $300M in annualized revenue. Luma AI has raised over $1 billion. Adobe, which owns Premiere Pro -- the very export target Martini depends on -- invested in Runway's Series E. These companies have the capital, the model expertise, and the distribution to build collaboration features and cinematography controls as product extensions in a quarter. The dossier correctly identifies "business model conflict" as a barrier for model companies building model-agnostic tools, but that logic assumes model companies can't simply add professional workflow features to their own platforms. They absolutely can, and Runway is already doing it. Martini's moat is UX design informed by filmmaking expertise -- replicable by any company that hires two cinematographers and a product designer.

Now, let me engage honestly with the bull case, because there's one worth articulating. The Figma analogy has surface appeal: design renderers commoditized, and the collaboration/workflow layer captured $20 billion in value. If AI video models commoditize similarly -- and there are signs of this with five or six models reaching commercial quality nearly simultaneously -- then the orchestration layer could be where value concentrates. Koh Terai's combination of Cannes screening credits, Stanford design training, and computer science fundamentals is genuinely rare; this isn't a generic engineer building a wrapper. The timing is arguably perfect: this is the exact moment when multiple models became commercially viable, creating the window for multi-model tooling. If Martini builds deep enough workflow lock-in -- project files, team configurations, integrated timelines -- before the model companies add these features natively, there's a path to a real business. But "a real business" is the ceiling of this scenario, not the floor. And the Figma comparison breaks on inspection: design files were the proprietary artifact that lived in Figma's cloud, creating massive switching costs. In Martini's case, the outputs are standard video files and XML exports -- the product is specifically designed to let content *leave* the platform. That's good product design for filmmakers but terrible for defensibility.

The founding team has genuine domain-market fit. A cinematographer who codes and an engineer who builds robust systems -- that's a sensible pairing for this product. But I don't see contrarian courage here. Building "Figma for AI video" is not something the consensus dismisses as crazy. It's the obvious product to build when multiple AI video models hit the market simultaneously. Nobody looks at this and says "that's impossible" or "that's insane." They look at it and say "sure, that makes sense" -- which is precisely the signal that the opportunity is incremental rather than transformational. My best investments were in things that Cisco's CTO said they'd never build, that food industry veterans said was ridiculous, that most VCs called laughable. When the experts nod along, you're not disrupting anything.

I'm passing. These are smart founders building a real product in a real market, and I expect they'll generate revenue. But the consequence of success doesn't justify the kind of bet I make. They've identified a genuine pain point -- filmmakers need better tools for AI -- and built a clean solution. That's good entrepreneurship. But I invest in founders who are trying to make entire systems obsolete, not founders building better interfaces for systems someone else is inventing. I'd tell Koh: you have the rare combination of creative and technical talent to attempt something that actually terrifies you. Go build the model, not the dashboard.
