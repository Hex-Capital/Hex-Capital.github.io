# Robby -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing fact in this entire dossier is buried in the competitive landscape table: Netic, which is building an "autonomous AI revenue engine" for home services, has raised $43 million at a $450 million valuation, grew revenue 1,700% in under a year, and is backed by Founders Fund and Greylock. My own fund already has a bet in this exact vertical. Meanwhile, Housecall Pro shipped "CSR AI" and "Coach AI" in fall 2025. Arch, backed by Coatue and Floodgate, is doing AI outbound marketing for ServiceTitan contractors. ServiceTitan itself went public at $8.45 billion and has every incentive and resource to build revenue-optimization features on top of its existing scheduling and dispatch infrastructure. This is not a market with a hidden secret waiting to be exploited. This is a Girardian convergence -- multiple companies imitating each other toward the same insight, which means it is not an insight at all but a consensus.

What is the secret here? The implicit thesis is that HVAC technicians are leaving money on the table and AI can coach them to capture it. I struggle to identify anyone in the home services software ecosystem who would disagree with that statement. Every company I just listed is pursuing some version of it. The differentiation -- "we focus on the in-field technician interaction rather than calls or marketing" -- is a positional choice within a competitive landscape, not a contrarian truth about the world. A secret must be something that most intelligent observers would actively reject. "The point of highest leverage in home services revenue is the technician standing in the customer's home" is, at best, a product insight that a competent product manager at ServiceTitan could arrive at in a week of customer interviews. It does not create a structural path to monopoly. There are no network effects in coaching individual technicians. There are no meaningful switching costs -- if Netic or Housecall Pro offers a better tool tomorrow, HVAC companies will switch without friction.

The founding team compounds my concern rather than alleviating it. Three Harvard MBA graduates who met at business school, pivoted from a customs brokerage AI platform when tariff policy shifted, then surveyed multiple industries before settling on home services. This is the archetype of what I have called indefinite optimism -- talented people with a process for finding opportunities rather than a conviction about a specific future. The ride-alongs and EPA certification pursuit are admirable domain immersion, but they signal diligence, not vision. Compare this to the founders I back at the earliest stage: Zuckerberg didn't survey industries before building Facebook; Buterin didn't pivot into Ethereum from a customs platform. Definite optimism requires a founder who knows, with specificity, what the world should look like and refuses to be talked out of it. These founders found their market through elimination, which is the lean methodology I explicitly distrust.

The technology offers no discontinuity. Combining CRM data with third-party sources to generate lead scores and talking points is a standard application of current LLM capabilities. The dossier itself notes that the core approach is "technically reproducible." This is a 1-to-n deployment of existing AI tools into a vertical, not a 0-to-1 creation. There is no proprietary algorithm, no novel architecture, no technical barrier that would take a well-resourced competitor more than a few months to replicate. ServiceTitan, with $762 million in revenue and a public-company war chest, could build or acquire this capability as a feature. The "data loop" from technician visits is real but thin -- it improves recommendations incrementally, not exponentially, and any competitor serving the same customers would accumulate similar data.

The strongest bull case requires believing that the in-field technician interaction is so fundamentally different from call center AI or outbound marketing that the companies targeting those surfaces cannot cross over -- that Robby's workflow-specific product, built from riding alongside dozens of technicians, creates compound advantages that generalist platforms cannot replicate. If the team's domain immersion produces a product so deeply embedded in the technician's daily routine that it becomes indispensable, and if 9+ paying customers grow into hundreds before incumbents fully ship their competing features, there is a path to building a meaningful vertical SaaS business. The early testimonials -- "$40k in new business within an hour," "6 figures in additional revenue opportunities every week" -- suggest genuine value creation for customers. But a good vertical SaaS business is not what I invest for. The power law demands that any investment I make must have a plausible path to returning the entire fund. A revenue-optimization layer for HVAC contractors, competing against a $450 million-valued direct competitor and an $8.45 billion incumbent, in a software market projected at $1.3 billion by 2035, does not present that path. This could be a solid $50-100 million outcome if everything goes right -- and that is precisely the kind of bet I leave for others.

The beachhead strategy -- starting with HVAC and expanding to plumbing, electrical, roofing -- is the one dimension where the team shows sound instincts. HVAC is a specific, concentrated segment where the product can be deeply tailored before expanding concentrically. But a good go-to-market in a bad competitive structure does not save the investment. Monopolizing HVAC revenue optimization requires structural barriers that do not exist here. I pass.
