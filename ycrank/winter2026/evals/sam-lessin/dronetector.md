# DroneTector -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my problem with DroneTector: this is a sane person with a sane idea. Three PhDs from St Andrews and Oxford building millimeter-wave radar to detect hostile drones -- in a world where every NATO defense ministry is publicly screaming that they need counter-drone technology, multiple companies are already doing $40-60 million in annual revenue selling exactly this, and the market is projected to grow at 25%+ CAGR. When I hear "anti-drone" in 2026, I hear the same thing I hear when someone says "AI for sales" -- the opportunity is so obvious that the returns have already been competed away. Robin Radar has 200+ radars deployed in Ukraine. DroneShield posted $57.5 million in FY2024 revenue. Dedrone got acquired by Axon. Fortem just landed the FIFA World Cup. Three PhD students in Glasgow with zero revenue and 233 LinkedIn connections are not walking into a non-consensus situation. They're walking into a knife fight with incumbents who have a five-year head start and hundreds of millions in backing.

What genuinely impresses me is the founder-technology fit. Matthew Moore's PhD dissertation is literally the product -- 94 GHz Doppler radar for experimental validation of small UAV micro-Doppler signatures, published in IET Radar, Sonar & Navigation, co-funded by QinetiQ. The CTO achieved what Oxford described as the highest single-qubit gate fidelity ever recorded across all quantum computing platforms. These are not people cosplaying as defense-tech founders. The "sane" calibration is about as strong as I've seen at pre-seed -- but that only matters if the idea is genuinely non-consensus. The 94 GHz millimeter-wave angle on nano drones adds some technical differentiation from competitors using lower frequencies or RF sensing, but "our physics are better for smaller targets" is a feature differentiation, not an insane idea. It's the kind of thing Robin Radar addresses by moving up-frequency in their next product cycle.

Where this business does light up my framework is on the AI-resistance test. This is a physical-world hardware company that software amplifies but cannot replace -- exactly the Craftwork and Seneca pattern I gravitate toward. You cannot software-engineer a millimeter-wave radar into existence. AI actually strengthens DroneTector by improving the classification and identification layers without enabling competitors who lack the underlying hardware. Defense procurement creates genuine switching costs once you're qualified and integrated -- these aren't month-to-month SaaS contracts, they're multi-year defense programs with security clearances and operational qualification cycles. The NATO DIANA and DASA participation provide real credentialing in procurement channels with massive barriers to entry. If I strip away everything except the structural moat question -- "does this business get stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper?" -- the answer is clearly stronger. That's the right answer.

The bull case I have to take seriously: the proliferation of sub-$50 nano drones is creating a detection gap that existing systems genuinely cannot close. If Robin Radar's lower-frequency approach fundamentally cannot resolve a 100-gram drone at operationally useful ranges, and if DroneTector's 94 GHz physics represents the only viable approach to that specific target class, then this isn't competing in counter-drone broadly -- it's creating a new capability layer that doesn't exist yet. Ukraine's 1,600+ monthly drone attacks are increasingly using smaller, cheaper platforms. The enabling "why now" -- millimeter-wave components becoming cheaper via automotive radar and 5G supply chains -- is a real technological inflection that lets three PhDs build what previously required a defense prime's budget. If this thesis is correct, DroneTector could function as the detection primitive that feeds into various defeat systems, becoming infrastructure rather than an endpoint product. That would change everything about my protocol-position assessment.

But I don't see enough evidence that the bull case is true. The dossier says DroneTector "claims higher-frequency radar for smaller targets" but provides no independent validation that existing systems actually fail on nano drones at operationally relevant parameters. Robin Radar pioneered micro-Doppler for drone detection and has deployed hundreds of units -- they're not ignoring this problem. The CTO's dual involvement with Quantum Fabrix on a three-person team is a genuine concern in a business where every hour of engineering matters. And the narrative ceiling is bounded: "airspace security" is a real but specific market category, not an infinity story. This doesn't expand the way Helium grew from IoT hotspots into decentralized wireless infrastructure. Counter-drone radar in 2026 is a market where competent execution wins you a nice defense contractor outcome -- not the kind of asymmetric return profile I need at seed to justify the concentration risk.

I respect the founders and the technical depth. If I were building a defense-focused fund, this would be a serious conversation. But my framework exists to identify non-consensus bets where the crowd is wrong, and the crowd isn't wrong about counter-drone being important -- the crowd is already heavily invested. The question is whether DroneTector's specific physics create a capability gap large enough to matter against scaled competitors, and I don't have the evidence to make that call with my own money.
