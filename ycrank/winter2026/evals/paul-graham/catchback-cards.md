# CatchBack Cards -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about CatchBack Cards is that the solution has fingerprints from the founder's previous job all over it. Joseph Zhang worked at Nexus, a blockchain verifiable computation company. CatchBack Cards is built on Nexus L1 blockchain infrastructure. The product uses cryptographic randomness proofs -- the exact kind of technology Nexus specializes in. This doesn't necessarily mean the idea is manufactured, but it raises the question I always ask first: did the founder discover a problem and then find the right tool, or did he have a tool and go looking for a problem? The crypto/Web3/NFT tags on the YC page make me lean toward the latter. Card collectors who get scammed on mystery packs don't lie awake wishing for on-chain verifiable computation. They wish they hadn't gotten scammed. Those are different starting points, and they lead to different products.

There is a genuine organic thread here, though, and I don't want to dismiss it. Zhang's YC page says he "quit his job to sell Pokémon cards." That's not nothing. Someone who actually trades cards knows the pain of opaque mystery packs, cash-only transactions at card shows, and the trust problem between strangers. The schlep is also real -- physical card inventory, buyback pricing that fluctuates with a volatile collectibles market, shipping logistics, regulatory exposure from what is essentially a gambling-adjacent product (hence the 18+ rating). That operational complexity does deter competitors. But here's what nags at me: the hardest schlep in this business isn't the cryptographic verification layer that Zhang built. It's the inventory management, the buyback liability, and the physical fulfillment. Those are retail operations problems, not engineering problems. The engineering is the part Zhang is drawn to. The schlep he's naturally inclined to tackle isn't the schlep that actually makes or breaks this business.

The co-founder situation is a real concern. Sophia Kim has no public presence whatsoever -- no LinkedIn profile identifiable among hundreds of results, no GitHub, no mention in any public-facing materials. Zhang appears alone in every external communication. I've seen this pattern enough times to know it usually means one of two things: either the co-founder is genuinely contributing but invisibly, or the co-founder was added to check a box. I forced Drew Houston to find a co-founder before accepting Dropbox, but the point was that the co-founder needed to be a genuine complement, not a name on a form. Without any evidence of what Sophia Kim brings to this company, I can't evaluate the team as a team.

The bull case deserves a real hearing. $13K MRR with 700 users roughly a month after launch is genuinely solid early traction -- that implies real spending behavior, not just downloads. Five app versions in four weeks shows the kind of build velocity I respect. The product concept -- letting users *create their own* mystery packs with customizable odds, verified cryptographically -- is novel in a way that neither Whatnot (live auctions) nor TCGplayer (fixed-price listings) nor DOPA (pre-configured packs) replicates. The guaranteed buyback mechanism adds instant liquidity that no competitor offers. And the Steph Curry collaboration, if it materializes, could be a legitimate distribution accelerant in a community that worships athlete-endorsed cards. If mystery packs are the emotional core of card collecting -- and anyone who's ever watched someone rip open a pack knows they are -- then making that experience trustworthy, customizable, and liquid could be a genuine unlock. The version of this that works looks like Whatnot's growth trajectory applied to an async, verifiable, and more accessible format.

But the competitive landscape gives me pause. DOPA has 100,000+ daily users in Japan and just entered the US market. That's not a hypothetical competitor -- it's an established operator with scale advantages in the exact product category CatchBack occupies. Whatnot, at $11.5B valuation, could add cryptographic pack verification as a feature without fundamentally restructuring their product. And the open-sourcing of CatchBack's randomness code, while clever for building trust, also hands the verification approach to anyone who wants to copy it. The moat here is operational bundle complexity -- doing many moderately hard things simultaneously -- rather than any single defensible technology. That kind of moat can work, but it's the hardest kind to maintain because you're running faster rather than standing behind a wall.

What I keep coming back to is this: a Stanford CS grad who previously worked at a blockchain company building a blockchain-verified mystery pack platform for trading cards. Each individual element makes sense. But the combination feels like it was assembled from the founder's resume rather than discovered through years of frustration as a collector. The card collecting experience is real but recent. The blockchain architecture is technically sophisticated but may be solving a trust problem that most collectors would rather solve with reputation and social proof -- the way Whatnot does it with live video. This is a capable founder building a real product with real early revenue. But it doesn't pass my organic test cleanly enough for me to write a check from my own money.
