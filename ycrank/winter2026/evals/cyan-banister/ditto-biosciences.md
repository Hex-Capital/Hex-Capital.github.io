# Ditto Biosciences -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The core idea here is the kind of thing that makes my ears perk up immediately: these founders are telling pharma companies they should be stealing the immune system playbook from parasitic worms, ticks, and viruses. Not designing drugs from scratch in a lab. Not tweaking known molecules with machine learning. They're saying — evolution already solved this problem. Parasites have spent millions of years figuring out how to quietly modulate our immune systems so they can survive inside us, and nobody has systematically gone through those proteins to find drugs. That's genuinely strange in the way I've learned to pay attention to. When I think about Crusoe turning waste gas into computation, or Contraline developing male birth control that made VCs squirm — those ideas shared this quality of being grounded in real science that most people find too uncomfortable or too bizarre to fund. Mining a million parasite proteins for autoimmune therapies has that same quality. It's not popular. It's difficult to assess. And 98% of those proteins remain uncharacterized, which means this team is exploring a space that's essentially unmapped.

But here's where I get honest about what I'm missing. When I evaluate founders, I start with their story — not the business. I want to know what happened to them that makes this the only problem they could be solving. And with Ditto's three founders, what I see are exceptionally credentialed scientists: Adair with her PhD from UCSF and 50+ papers, Dennis with his Harvard degree and Berkeley PhD, Emily with her UCSD doctorate. They're brilliant. They came together at Arcadia Science, a startup built around studying understudied organisms, and after three years of working side by side they realized the parasite proteins they'd been studying could be a therapeutic goldmine. That's a compelling intellectual origin story. But it's not a survival story. I don't see the biographical thread where someone's mother suffered from lupus and the standard treatments destroyed her quality of life, or where one of them grew up watching autoimmune disease ravage their community. The connection between these founders and autoimmune disease runs through scientific fascination, not through personal necessity. And in my experience, when the road gets impossibly long — and in biotech, we're talking 10-15 years to an approved drug — the founders who persist are the ones running toward something deeply personal, not just intellectually thrilling.

What I do find compelling is the team's structural relationship. Three co-founders who spent three years building together at the same startup before launching their own company — that's one of the best co-founder signals you can get. After what happened with HQ Trivia, where the product was transformative but the 50/50 founder dynamic destroyed everything, I probe this relentlessly now. Ditto's team has already been through startup stress together. They have complementary skills that actually make sense for this specific problem — parasitology, computational genomics, microbiology and sequencing. And the fact that they all chose to leave Arcadia together to pursue this tells me they trust each other enough to take the leap with their own careers on the line. That matters enormously over a long journey.

The bull case here is real, and I want to be clear about it. If this platform works, it's not one drug — it's a systematic way to discover thousands of therapeutic candidates from a source that nobody else is mining at this scale. The competitive landscape shows exits happening: Merck paid $1.9 billion for Pandion Therapeutics, and that was synthetic protein design, not this evolutionary biology approach. The specialized knowledge barrier — parasitology plus computational genomics plus protein engineering — is genuinely hard to replicate, even for pharma companies with hundreds of millions in R&D budgets. The tissue biobank they're building for immunogenicity mapping could become a unique data asset. And the timing argument is sound: AlphaFold and advances in protein structure prediction make it possible to systematically screen parasite genomes in ways that would have been prohibitively expensive five years ago. If you believe in convergent timing the way I do, this has the ingredients.

But where I ultimately land is that this doesn't activate my full framework. The economic access dimension — which is central to how I think about why a company matters — is thin here. When I backed Uber, I saw a poverty alleviation tool for drivers. When I backed Affirm, I saw transparent credit access replacing predatory fees. Ditto Bio, if it succeeds, will produce better treatments for autoimmune patients, and that's genuinely important. But it doesn't create economic access or make an invisible system visible for underserved populations in the way my highest-conviction investments do. It's a biotech drug discovery platform with a novel sourcing strategy — valuable, but not the kind of company where I feel that visceral pull about who it helps and how it changes their lives. Combined with the missing biographical grit narrative and the reality that this is a decade-plus journey through regulatory complexity against competitors with hundreds of millions in funding, I'd want to meet these founders and hear their stories directly. The weirdness is real. The team is strong. But I'm not writing a check today without hearing what I'm missing from the dossier — the personal thread that tells me why these three people will still be grinding on this problem in year eight when the data doesn't cooperate and the money runs low.
