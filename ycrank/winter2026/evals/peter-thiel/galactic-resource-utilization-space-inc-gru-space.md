# Galactic Resource Utilization Space, Inc. (GRU Space) -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of GRU Space is the dependency chain. This company does not merely need its own technology to work -- it needs SpaceX's Starship to achieve reliable, affordable lunar delivery. It needs the CLPS program to provide landing slots. It needs regolith-to-brick conversion, demonstrated only in terrestrial laboratories, to function on the actual lunar surface. It needs inflatable habitats to survive micrometeoroid bombardment and radiation in a lunar pit. It needs a regulatory framework for commercial lunar habitation that does not currently exist. And it needs ultra-high-net-worth individuals to commit $10 million each for a multi-day stay in an environment that has never hosted a civilian. Each link in this chain has independent failure probability. When I backed SpaceX, the dependency chain was shorter: build a rocket, launch it, land it. Musk controlled his own critical path. GRU Space's critical path runs through SpaceX, NASA, the FAA, and the Outer Space Treaty before it reaches the company's own technology. That is not a secret about the world -- it is a bet that half a dozen external factors will resolve favorably within six years.

What is the secret here? The implicit claim is that in-situ resource utilization makes commercial lunar habitation economically viable -- that converting regolith into structural materials on-site eliminates the mass penalty that makes lunar construction prohibitively expensive. But this is not a contrarian truth. It is the consensus view within planetary science. NASA, ESA, and multiple academic institutions are investing in ISRU research for exactly this reason. Dr. Cannon's own career -- founding the Exolith Lab, creating the Planetary Simulant Database, receiving $2 million in NASA funding for aluminum extraction from regolith -- demonstrates that the establishment agrees with the thesis. When your secret is also NASA's roadmap, it is not a secret. The genuinely contrarian claim would be that a two-person pre-seed startup can operationalize this technology on the lunar surface before any government agency does, and turn it into a hospitality business. That is contrarian, but it is contrarian in the way that saying "I will run a three-minute mile" is contrarian -- the skepticism is not about the desirability of the outcome but about the feasibility of this particular actor achieving it.

Dr. Kevin Cannon's involvement is the single strongest signal in this dossier. He is arguably the world's foremost authority on lunar regolith processing. He founded the laboratory that produces the simulants everyone else uses for research. He left a professorship at Colorado School of Mines and a CTO role at Ethos Space to join GRU Space. That career decision contains information -- the leading domain expert chose habitation over infrastructure, and chose this company over remaining in academia where his work was already well-funded. When I co-founded Palantir, the key insight was that we had people who understood something specific about anti-fraud algorithms from PayPal that nobody else had combined with intelligence analysis. Cannon represents a similar concentration of relevant expertise. But Cannon is "Founding Member of Technical Staff," not co-founder. The company is structured as Skyler Chan's vision with Cannon as the domain expert. Chan is 22, an ex-Tesla software engineer who built a NASA-funded 3D printer -- impressive for his age, but categorically different from managing multi-mission lunar operations over a decade-long timeline.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. If Starship achieves affordable lunar delivery -- and the trajectory suggests this is when, not if -- then someone will build the first commercial structure on the Moon. GRU Space, by virtue of Cannon's expertise and the phased mission plan (10 kg demo in 2029, cave habitat in 2031, full deployment in 2032), would have a meaningful head start. The first entity to demonstrate operational ISRU on the lunar surface owns data that is literally irreplicable without conducting your own lunar missions -- a moat created by the physics of iteration, not by software network effects. The long-term vision -- lunar infrastructure, property, Mars habitats -- maps to civilizational ambition of the kind I value. And the vision is undeniably definite: three missions with specific dates, specific payloads, specific guest counts. This is not lean-startup iteration. This is someone drawing a line from here to a hotel on the Moon. The deposit model ($250K-$1M) is a clever mechanism for both demand validation and early cash flow. If even a few dozen deposits materialize, it demonstrates that the customer exists.

But the power-law math does not work for an angel check. The capital required to execute three lunar missions will be measured in billions, not millions. My $500,000 into Facebook could meaningfully fund the company through its next growth phase. A similar check into GRU Space would be diluted into irrelevance across the fundraising rounds required to reach the first revenue-generating mission in 2032 at the earliest. The company's stated ambition to "own property on the Moon" is not merely speculative -- it is legally impossible under the Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits national sovereignty claims on celestial bodies and by extension undermines private property regimes. And the TAM projections cited ($1.3-1.6 billion for space tourism) describe a market of suborbital joyrides and orbital ISS visits, not $10 million lunar surface stays -- the actual addressable market for this product is perhaps a few hundred individuals globally at current wealth distributions. This is a company I would follow with intellectual fascination. The vision is definite, the domain expertise is genuine, and the category is truly new. But the secret belongs to SpaceX, not to GRU Space -- and the gap between a brilliant vision and a viable business is, in this case, approximately 238,900 miles.
