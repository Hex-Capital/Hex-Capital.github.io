# Q2Q -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

This is "AI SDR but for private equity" -- and that framing tells you most of what you need to know. The underlying components are commodity APIs assembled into a vertical workflow: LLM-generated emails, AI voice agents, company database lookups, calendar booking. Each piece is available off-the-shelf. The integration is the product, and integration without proprietary technology is a feature, not a company. When I look at my best investments -- Stack Overflow's compounding knowledge graph, Alchemy's developer infrastructure layer, Replit's programming environment -- they all share one property: the technology itself becomes harder to replicate with every user. Q2Q's outreach engine doesn't have that structure. A well-funded horizontal AI SDR company like 11x or Artisan, with hundreds of millions in funding, could add a "PE deal sourcing" template in a quarter. The vertical specialization is a positioning choice, not a moat.

The specific knowledge question is where this falls short of my bar. Brianna Lin worked as a PE analyst at a buyout firm and in investment banking at Jefferies. She experienced the manual sourcing workflow firsthand -- she's seen the pain. But that's career familiarity, not the kind of non-transferable knowledge I look for. Every PE analyst who's ever built a prospect list in Excel at 2 AM has had the same insight: "this should be automated." The observation is correct and widely shared, which is precisely why it doesn't constitute specific knowledge. I'd want to hear something that surprises me -- a counterintuitive insight about why business owners respond to certain outreach patterns, or a structural theory about information asymmetry in lower-middle-market deal flow that no database can solve. The dossier shows me credentials, not obsession. Claire Wu brings engineering capability from hedge fund work and Qualtrics, but nothing in her background suggests deep expertise in the specific technical challenges Q2Q faces -- email deliverability at scale, AI voice agent quality, or private company data matching. They're smart, credentialed, and building in a space one of them knows. That's necessary but insufficient.

The leverage architecture concerns me most. PE firms, search funds, and independent sponsors constitute a narrow buyer universe -- perhaps a few thousand active teams globally. This isn't "code as leverage multiplied across millions of knowledge workers." It's automation substituting for junior analyst labor within a small, well-served market. There are no network effects described: one PE firm's usage doesn't make Q2Q better for another PE firm. Compare this to how every Notion template or Stack Overflow answer compounds the platform's value for all users. Q2Q's value is transactional -- find targets, send outreach, book meetings. If the meetings dry up or response rates decline (a real risk as business owners get flooded with AI-generated outreach), the value proposition erodes rather than compounds.

The contrarian timing test fails cleanly. "AI automates manual workflows" is the single most consensus thesis in technology right now. AI SDR is one of the most crowded categories in the YC ecosystem. The PE-specific angle doesn't make this contrarian -- it makes it a vertical application of consensus. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal. When I invested in Bitcoin, it was dismissed as digital Monopoly money. The best returns come from bets where informed people think you're wrong. Nobody thinks "AI can automate outreach" is wrong -- the debate is only about execution and timing. The Datasite consolidation (acquiring both Grata and SourceScrub for a combined $500M+ commitment) actually works against Q2Q: it signals that well-resourced incumbents are actively building toward the same end-to-end workflow, with existing relationships and data assets Q2Q doesn't have.

The strongest bull case would require three things to be true simultaneously: (1) the PE deal sourcing workflow is sufficiently unique that horizontal AI SDR platforms can't serve it effectively, creating a durable vertical niche; (2) Datasite's consolidation creates buyer fatigue that opens a window for alternatives; and (3) Q2Q builds a genuine data flywheel on outreach effectiveness -- which messages, channels, and timing yield the highest owner response rates across industries -- that becomes proprietary over thousands of campaigns. If all three hold, this could be a solid niche SaaS business generating $10-30M ARR serving the PE ecosystem. But even in this scenario, the outcome is a good business, not a leverage-creating platform that reshapes how capital allocation works. The ceiling is a feature acquisition by Datasite or Affinity, not a compounding platform that gets stronger for decades. I'm looking for companies where the founder knows something that can't be taught, building something that creates leverage that didn't previously exist. This is a competent team applying available technology to a workflow they've experienced. That's a fine business. It's not my bet.
