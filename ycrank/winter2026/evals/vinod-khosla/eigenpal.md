# EigenPal -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is exactly the kind of company I struggle with -- not because the team is weak or the product doesn't work, but because I can't construct a scenario where success changes anything fundamental about the world. If EigenPal executes flawlessly and captures a dominant share of the intelligent document processing market, what happens? Enterprises process their invoices and KYC forms 40% faster. Banks close loans with fewer manual touchpoints. Insurance claims get routed more efficiently. Fine. But nobody's life is materially different. No trillion-dollar system gets replaced. The documents still exist, the workflows still exist, the industries still operate the same way. The consequence of complete success is a profitable software company in a crowded market -- and I've seen enough of those to know that's not what justifies the risk of early-stage capital.

The competitive landscape tells you everything about the ambition calibration problem. Hyperscience has $439 million in funding. Rossum did $44.9 million in revenue last year with $104 million raised. ABBYY is a market leader with 60% ARR growth. Docsumo is doing $10.3 million in revenue on $3.7 million raised. EigenPal's differentiation -- template-free LLM-based processing -- is real today but the dossier itself acknowledges this "may become table stakes within 12-18 months." When your core differentiator has an 18-month shelf life and your competitors have hundreds of millions in funding and established enterprise relationships, you haven't found a structural advantage. You've found a timing window. Timing windows close.

The bull case deserves a genuine hearing. The IDP market growing from $2.3 billion to $43.9 billion by 2034 is a significant expansion. Two large European bank customers at pre-seed is legitimately impressive traction -- most YC companies at this stage are still searching for their first design partner. The SOC II Type 2 certification before raising serious capital shows operational maturity that most pre-seed teams lack. And the LLM-native architecture versus legacy template-based systems is a genuine generational shift, analogous to how Juniper's TCP/IP routing was architecturally superior to Cisco's legacy switching. If I squint, I can see a version of this where EigenPal rides the LLM wave to displace legacy IDP vendors the same way cloud-native companies displaced on-premise software. But the critical difference is that Juniper was attempting something Cisco's CTO publicly declared they would never do -- the incumbents were ideologically opposed to the new architecture. Here, ABBYY and Rossum are already actively incorporating LLM capabilities. The incumbents aren't dismissing the approach; they're adopting it. When the establishment validates your thesis, you're probably not disrupting them.

On the founders -- Novak being a 3-time B2B AI founder with MIT CS and McKinsey exposure is a strong credential set, but it maps precisely to the pattern I find less interesting: an experienced B2B operator executing a well-understood playbook in a defined market category. This isn't an outsider reimagining how information flows through organizations from first principles. It's a capable team building a better mousetrap in a category that already has dozens of mice. The co-founder attention split -- Novak still listed as CEO of Assetario alongside EigenPal -- is a pragmatic concern, but the deeper issue is that nothing about this company signals the kind of contrarian conviction that precedes transformational outcomes. Blaszyk's search infrastructure experience from Elastic and Yelp is directly relevant, which is both a strength for execution and a weakness for innovation -- domain experts tend to build better versions of what they already know rather than inventing entirely new categories.

The technology timing is the most favorable dimension. Vision-language models genuinely crossed a capability threshold in 2023-2024 that makes template-free document understanding viable for the first time. That's a real technology curve. But EigenPal is arriving at this moment alongside every other team that has access to GPT-4V and Claude Vision. The technology wave is democratized -- it lifts everyone, including the incumbents with larger sales teams and existing customer relationships. When I backed OpenAI in 2019, the talent flow and model improvement rates were visible but the opportunity was not consensus. Document processing with LLMs in 2025-2026 is thoroughly consensus. The rate of change in the underlying models favors everyone, not specifically EigenPal.

I pass here. These founders are too capable to spend their careers making enterprise paperwork marginally less painful. The problem they're solving is real but bounded. If they brought me a thesis about eliminating documents entirely -- about restructuring how information moves through regulated industries so that the concept of a "document" becomes obsolete -- that's a consequence of success worth pursuing. Making the document pipeline 10x better is an optimization, not a transformation.
