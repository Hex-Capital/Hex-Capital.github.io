# Martini -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Martini: it's a smart, well-positioned product in an extremely hot market. And that's actually my concern, not my encouragement. When I look at the generative AI video space -- Runway at $5.3 billion, Luma at $4 billion, Pika at nearly a billion in funding -- I see a category where consensus has already formed. Every major VC firm on Sand Hill Road is writing checks into AI video. Martini's angle of being the model-agnostic orchestration layer is genuinely clever, and the "Figma for AI film" framing is clean. But clever framing and consensus markets don't usually produce the kinds of returns I'm looking for. The companies that have worked best for me -- SpaceX when private space was considered delusional, Uber when ride-sharing was illegal -- were things people actively laughed at. Nobody is laughing at AI filmmaking tools. They're fighting over allocation.

I always start with the founder's story, and what I can see here is strong domain expertise without the biographical thread I typically need. Koh Terai is a Cannes-screened cinematographer with a computer science degree from NYU Abu Dhabi and a design master's from Stanford -- that's a genuinely rare combination, and it means he's building the tool he'd want to use on his own shoots. I respect that deeply. But what I'm missing is the part of the story that tells me why this person will grind through the inevitable crises that come with building a company surrounded by competitors with a thousand times more capital. Stanford d.school featured profiles and Cannes screenings suggest a talented, accomplished person on a well-supported trajectory. That's admirable, but it's different from the signal I got from the Contraline founder who'd spent years in academic obscurity working on male contraception that everyone else dismissed, or from Travis Kalanick's raw gravitas born from years of legal battles. I don't see evidence of the specific hardship that forges the kind of unreasonable persistence this company will need.

The competitive dynamics here genuinely worry me, and they're the kind of structural risk I weigh heavily. Martini is an orchestration layer sitting between commodity inputs -- third-party AI models available via API -- and professional users who ultimately export into Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve. Adobe invested in Runway's Series E and owns Premiere Pro. They could build native AI generation directly into their NLE products tomorrow. The model companies themselves, flush with billions, could add collaboration features and cinematography controls as product extensions. The business model conflict argument -- that model companies won't build model-agnostic routing because it cannibalizes their core business -- is valid, but it only protects against one direction of attack. It doesn't protect against Adobe building this into Premiere, or against each model company building workflow features around its own model. The moat here feels thin: proprietary UX informed by filmmaking expertise is real but replicable by any well-funded team that hires a few DPs.

The strongest bull case is compelling and I want to be honest about it. If AI video generation follows the trajectory of cloud computing -- where multiple providers compete on model quality while a workflow layer captures the collaboration and tooling value -- then Martini is perfectly positioned. The timing of multiple models reaching commercial quality simultaneously does create a genuine need for a model-agnostic workspace. Koh's cinematographer eye gives the product an authenticity that engineering-first teams would struggle to replicate quickly. And the "200+ films created on the platform" with TV commercials and viral social content suggests real usage. If this team executes fast enough to build workflow lock-in before the incumbents wake up, the network effects from team collaboration could create real switching costs. But that's a narrow window, and the company needs to sprint while surrounded by opponents with orders of magnitude more resources.

On the economic access dimension that matters deeply to me, I see a glimmer but not a fire. The free Indie tier could theoretically democratize professional filmmaking for independent creators who can't afford traditional production costs -- and that's the kind of access expansion I backed Uber and Postmates for. But the current positioning toward professional studios and agencies, the sales-assisted onboarding model, and the "request access" flow all suggest this is being built for people who already have resources, not for the filmmaker in a small town who can't afford a camera crew. It might evolve in that direction, but I can't invest on evolution I'm imagining rather than intent I can see.

I also notice I know almost nothing about the co-founder relationship. Koh and Long have no shared university or prior employer in the public record. Their skills are beautifully complementary on paper -- the cinematographer-storyteller and the systems engineer. But after HQ Trivia taught me that even perfect product-market timing can't survive founder conflict, I need to understand how two people who apparently came from very different worlds resolve disagreements when everything is on fire. That's a question I'd want answered in a meeting, and its absence from any public signal leaves a gap in my assessment.

This is a well-built product by domain-capable founders in a space I don't have conviction about. It doesn't activate the pattern I've learned to trust -- where the idea looks ridiculous, the founder's biography makes the mission inevitable, and the regulatory or structural complexity creates a moat that deters everyone else. Martini looks reasonable. It looks smart. And for my approach, that's exactly the problem.
