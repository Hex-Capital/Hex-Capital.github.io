# Fort -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is a structural mismatch between the team's specific knowledge and the actual bottleneck of the product they're building. Three mechanical engineers from Tesla and SpaceX -- Miranda on battery cell design, Paul on sensing systems and cabin radar, Zac on spacecraft structures -- know how to take a physical product from prototype to manufacturing. That knowledge is genuinely rare and non-trivial. Most consumer hardware startups die in manufacturing hell, and these founders have watched the full journey at Tesla scale. But Fort's differentiation isn't in the hardware. The sensors -- IMU, optical heart rate -- are commodity components. The entire value proposition lives in the algorithm: can you reliably auto-detect 50+ exercises, count reps, measure velocity, and estimate proximity to failure from wrist-worn motion data? That's a signal processing and machine learning problem. No one on the founding team has an ML or software background. No public GitHub repos for any of them. They pivoted away from EMG sensors early on, which tells me they're learning the sensor domain in real time rather than bringing pre-existing depth. Paul's cabin radar work is the closest adjacent experience, but automotive radar processing and biomechanical movement classification are different worlds. The specific knowledge here is in atoms, not bits -- and the competitive battle will be fought in bits.

The leverage architecture concerns me more than the team gap. Fort is a physical product sold at $289-349 per unit. Revenue scales with units manufactured and shipped. Every additional customer requires producing, packaging, and delivering another device. That's the definition of an unleveraged business at the unit economics level. The subscription analytics layer could eventually create software leverage, and the training data flywheel could compound -- but both are speculative for a company that hasn't shipped. Compare this to Replit, where one engineer's improvement serves every user simultaneously, or Stack Overflow, where every question-answer pair makes the entire platform more valuable. Fort has no network effects, no protocol dynamics, no platform layer. It's a consumer electronics product with an analytics subscription bolted on. Consumer hardware can build incredible brands -- Apple proved that -- but the leverage ratio is fundamentally different from what I look for.

The timing isn't contrarian. It's consensus dressed as insight. WHOOP reports 122% year-over-year growth in strength workouts. Oura calls strength training its third most popular activity among women. The longevity movement, Peter Attia's influence, GLP-1 adoption driving muscle preservation interest -- these are widely understood cultural shifts. Five press outlets covered Fort's launch. Turner Novak amplified it. This is a well-timed entry into a recognized trend, not a bet against a gloomy crowd. The only mildly contrarian element is the dedicated-device thesis in an era of consolidation -- most consumers want fewer devices, not more. But "people will carry a second wearable just for the gym" is a bet I'd want to see validated with real user behavior before committing capital.

The strongest bull case: if this team nails the auto-detection algorithm, and it genuinely works -- you put on a band, do your workout, and Fort knows every exercise, every rep, your proximity to failure, your per-muscle-group fatigue -- that's a magical product experience that no incumbent currently delivers. WHOOP and Oura are culturally anchored to recovery and sleep; pivoting to strength-first tracking would dilute their brands. The multi-mount form factor (wrist, magnetic equipment attachment, body strap) captures biomechanical data that wrist-only devices fundamentally cannot, which is a real sensor-placement insight. And the Tesla manufacturing DNA means they might actually ship on time when most hardware startups don't. If all of that lands, the data flywheel kicks in, and Fort becomes the WHOOP of the weight room -- a category-defining brand. That's a real outcome. But it requires the algorithm to work at a level the team hasn't yet demonstrated the technical background to deliver, and it requires WHOOP not to ship a firmware update that closes the gap using the strength training data they're already collecting from millions of users.

The compounding question is where the bet breaks down for me. WHOOP has more strength training users today than Fort will have for years. Each of those users generates movement and heart rate data during their workouts. WHOOP's data advantage for training exercise auto-detection algorithms is structural and growing. Fort's multi-mount form factor is a genuine hardware differentiation, but it can be replicated by any competitor willing to ship an equipment clip. The underlying science -- IMU-based motion classification, PPG-based heart rate variability -- is well-published. This is an execution race, not a technology moat. And in execution races against incumbents with hundred-million-dollar revenue bases, the startup needs either a fundamental technology advantage or a distribution trick. I don't see either here.

I respect the team. Three engineers who left Tesla to build something they personally want to use -- that's genuine. But genuine frustration with existing products is the starting point for a million consumer hardware companies, not the specific knowledge filter I apply. What would change my mind: a fourth co-founder with deep ML and biomechanics expertise, evidence that the multi-mount approach captures data that is physically impossible for wrist-only devices to replicate (not just "better" but "categorically different"), or pre-order numbers that suggest the strength community is pulling this product into existence. Without those signals, this is a competent hardware team in a competitive market without the algorithmic talent to win the only fight that matters.
