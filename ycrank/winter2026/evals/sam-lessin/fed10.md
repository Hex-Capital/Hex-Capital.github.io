# Fed10 -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing about "AI agents that replace your policy consultants" -- this is literally the pitch template I use as a cautionary example when I talk to founders about what NOT to build. Take an expensive human service, point an LLM at it, charge less. It's the most consensus play in technology right now. Every VC has seen forty versions of this across legal, accounting, consulting, recruiting. The idea isn't insane -- it's the most sane, most obvious, most well-trodden path in the current cycle. And that's precisely why it fails my primary filter. When the "insane idea" is actually the default idea that every CS student pitches in their YC application, you're not buying non-consensus. You're buying narrative at market price.

Now, the founders deserve a closer look because they're not the typical engineer-applies-AI-to-domain-they-Googled-last-week team. Armand Iorgulescu actually lobbied in Nevada, drafted legislation signed into law, and was the youngest Governor appointee in the state. Zayan Islam brings Berkeley CS chops. Winston Wei bridges both worlds with CS and political science. They're genuine best friends who worked together in government before starting a company -- that relational depth matters, and it's the kind of founding team origin story I respect. The domain credibility is real. But it's also thin -- these are recent graduates with student-era lobbying experience, not twenty-year K Street operators who've built and lost and rebuilt relationships across administrations. The "sane" part of the equation is present but at lower wattage than what this type of bet demands.

The structural moat problem here is severe, and it's exactly the failure mode I've been writing about since 2024. Fed10's moat IS the AI. Strip away the LLM analysis layer and what remains? A legislative text scraper and a CRM. FiscalNote has $120 million in revenue, data on 12,000 local governments and 4,000 school boards, and they're already shipping AI modules. Quorum has 2,000 customers including half the Fortune 100. These incumbents don't need to build Fed10 -- they need to add a feature. And they will, because the business model tension the dossier describes (incumbents cannibalizing their own consulting upsell) dissolves the moment their customers start demanding AI analysis as table stakes. Meanwhile, USLege already raised $2.7M doing the same thing, and Plural Policy got acquired for its AI regulatory analysis. This isn't a blue ocean -- it's already crowded, and the biggest boats have the most distribution. My test is simple: does this business get stronger or weaker as software gets cheaper? As LLMs get better and cheaper, every competitor's analysis quality converges toward Fed10's. That's fatal.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: these founders understand the actual work product of a policy consultant in a way that pure technologists never will. If they nail output quality -- and legislative analysis is a domain where hallucinations carry real liability risk, so quality IS the moat -- they could become the trusted standard for government affairs teams before incumbents retool. The CRM and workflow embedding creates switching costs. The $5.24 billion lobbying market grew 19% year-over-year, meaning demand is accelerating. And maybe the "lobbyist CRM" angle is the real play -- not the AI analysis, but the workflow infrastructure that government affairs teams can't easily rip out. If Fed10 becomes the operating system for how lobbying shops manage their legislative portfolios, the AI analysis is the "cherry on top" rather than the core. I can see the version of this where it works. But that story requires Fed10 to out-execute FiscalNote and Quorum on product, out-sell them on distribution, and maintain an AI quality advantage -- all simultaneously, as a three-person pre-seed team with no visible customers. The probability of threading that needle against entrenched incumbents who are already moving is low.

What I keep coming back to is the application-versus-primitive question. Venmo created a new payment primitive. Solana created a new consensus primitive. Helium created a new wireless primitive. Fed10 creates... a faster way to do something people already do, using tools that are broadly available, in a market where established players have massive distribution advantages. There's no new layer being built here that other businesses compose on top of. There's no protocol position. It's an application on existing infrastructure -- LLMs plus legislative data feeds -- and applications get absorbed. I'd rather fund the company building the proprietary legislative data infrastructure that tools like Fed10 depend on than Fed10 itself.
