# Origin -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Origin is a mismatch between the magnitude of the problem and the ambition of the company's positioning. Gene therapy safety — controlling where, when, and how intensely a therapeutic gene expresses — is a genuinely critical bottleneck. Get this wrong, and patients die from off-target toxicity. Get this right, and you unlock treatments for cancers, CNS disorders, and genetic diseases that are currently untreatable because the risk-reward equation is too unfavorable. That's a problem worth attacking. But Origin has positioned itself as a tool vendor: "seeking partnerships with pharma/biotech companies to design regulatory sequences" and "license proprietary dataset and sequence-protein interaction data." They've taken a problem whose consequence of success could be civilization-altering and scoped it down to a B2B licensing play. That's the kind of ambition compression I find most frustrating — smart founders taking a massive problem and immediately de-risking themselves into an enabling-technology niche where the upside ceiling is someone else's partnership budget.

The technology angle is real but contested. De novo generative design of synthetic regulatory DNA is a genuinely different approach from screening libraries of natural promoters — if it works, you're designing from scratch rather than choosing from a limited menu, which should produce better regulatory elements across more cell types. The claim of outperforming DeepMind's AlphaGenome is the kind of statement that gets my attention. But it's also the kind of claim that needs independent validation, and right now it has none — no peer-reviewed benchmark, no published wet-lab data confirming the computationally generated elements actually function as predicted in living cells. The gap between "our model predicts better regulatory activity in silico" and "our synthetic elements produce precise, safe gene expression in patients" is measured in years of experimental validation and hundreds of millions of dollars. Asimov, with $205 million already raised, is already offering AI-designed tissue-specific promoters as part of a broader platform. Two undergrads claiming to beat DeepMind need extraordinary evidence, not just a YC launch page assertion.

The outsider founder dynamic is the strongest signal here. Two UIUC computer science students — no biology PhDs, no pharma experience — attacking regulatory genomics with pure ML approaches. This is the pattern that produced Juniper Networks: Pradeep Sindhu applying computer science principles from Xerox PARC to networking, ignoring what Cisco's engineers said was impossible. Yash has a prior exit with Diginoor (a $1M seed NFT marketplace — irrelevant domain but demonstrates he can build, ship, and sell a company), and Malhar published in Nature Scientific Reports during high school and worked at Automorphic, a YC S23 company. The advisory board — Kellis at MIT/Broad for regulatory genomics, Paulk at UCSF for AAV gene therapy, Bashir at UIUC for bioengineering — is deliberately assembled to fill the biology gap. That's intelligent gene pool engineering for a pre-seed team. But here's my concern: applying AI to biology in 2026 is not contrarian. It's the most crowded thesis in venture capital right now. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, the experts dismissed AI as laughable. Nobody is dismissing AI for genomics today — they're publishing Nature papers about it and building $200M-funded companies around it. The outsider advantage diminishes when everyone else is also rushing into the field.

The bull case I have to take seriously: if regulatory DNA design is truly the critical bottleneck — the rate-limiting step — in gene therapy development, then the company that owns the best generative model and the largest validated dataset becomes the Illumina of gene therapy expression control. Every new therapy needs their elements. The proprietary dataset compounds with each partnership. The 19.6% CAGR in gene therapy creates expanding demand for their core capability. And two young founders with rapid learning rates could evolve their ambition — start as a tool provider, realize they should own more of the value chain, and eventually become a platform that controls expression design for the entire industry. Pat Brown started with just heme protein; the ambition expanded. For this to work, three things must be true: (1) the computational predictions must translate to wet-lab reality, which requires capital and capabilities Origin currently lacks; (2) the proprietary dataset must grow faster than academic open-source alternatives and Asimov's own data; and (3) the founders must resist the gravitational pull of staying a comfortable services business and instead pursue the transformational platform play.

I land on this as a company I respect but don't invest in from my own pocket at this stage. The problem matters. The founders have the right outsider profile. But the consequence of success, as currently scoped, is a modestly valuable enabling-technology business — not the kind of outcome that justifies the risk of total loss. They've narrowed the aperture to increase their probability of building something rather than widening it to maximize what they could build. I want founders who scare themselves with the scale of their ambition. Origin's ambition, right now, is calibrated for a solid B2B outcome, not for replacing how gene therapy works.
