# ZeroSettle -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that strikes me immediately about ZeroSettle: this is one of the most consensus opportunities I've seen in a while. When Apple lost the Epic v. Apple ruling in April 2025, every fintech operator and payments company in the world saw the same opening at the same time. Paddle and RevenueCat announced their joint solution within two months. Appcharge had already raised $89 million. Neon had Thrive Capital and a16z money. Stripe published iOS payment processing docs. This isn't a market where two founders independently arrived at an insight nobody else could see -- this is a land grab triggered by a court ruling that was front-page news for weeks. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. ZeroSettle is neither. Everyone understands this opportunity, and the well-capitalized incumbents are already executing against it.

When I think about the founders, I can see the technical competence clearly -- both Ryan and Gabe worked at Apple on systems-level software, which gives them genuine insight into StoreKit internals, App Store Connect, and the platform constraints that make this product hard to build correctly. Ryan holds a patent from Apple. That's real domain knowledge. But when I imagine sitting across from them and asking "tell me your story -- not the business," what I'd hear is: we're skilled engineers who saw a market opportunity created by a legal ruling. I wouldn't hear about the personal struggle that made this problem feel urgent, the kind of biographical thread that makes a founder persist through the crisis that's inevitably coming. The founders with the deepest staying power are solving problems that grew out of their own pain. I don't see that connective tissue here. The wsbtickerbot project on Ryan's GitHub -- a Reddit scraper for r/wallstreetbets -- actually reinforces my concern that this team gravitates toward whatever market is generating buzz rather than solving something deeply personal.

The strongest version of the bull case deserves real engagement. Two Apple engineers who understand the platform at a systems level are building a single integrated SDK that handles MoR responsibilities across 190+ jurisdictions -- that's genuinely hard operational infrastructure. The Paddle + RevenueCat solution requires two vendor integrations; ZeroSettle offers one. The March 2026 compliance deadline creates urgency, and developers need turnkey solutions right now. If ZeroSettle can use the Founding Partner Program and YC network to land anchor customers quickly, switching costs from SDK integration and subscriber migration could create real stickiness. And Apple itself can't build this product because it would cannibalize its own commission stream -- that's a structural moat against the most dangerous potential competitor. If I believed this team had the grit and the personal conviction to outrun Paddle's hundreds of employees on $293 million in funding, I'd get interested. But a two-person team offering their product free for two years while racing against billion-dollar incumbents is not a bet on conviction -- it's a bet on execution speed in a market where the other runners started with a head start and longer legs.

The regulatory dimension cuts in two directions and I want to be honest about that tension. On one hand, navigating tax compliance across 190+ countries, jurisdiction-specific checkout flows for the US versus the EU, and Apple's constantly shifting guidelines -- that's genuinely complex work that creates operational barriers to entry. I've always been drawn to founders who are willing to wade into regulatory thickets that scare off less committed competitors. But unlike Contraline, where the FDA pathway was a moat that protected the company once navigated, ZeroSettle's regulatory foundation is actively unstable. The December 2025 appeals court ruling suggesting Apple can charge a "reasonable commission" on external transactions could narrow or eliminate the savings proposition entirely. You're building a house on ground that might shift under you, and unlike Anduril where defense procurement complexity rewards patience, here the regulatory risk is existential -- it could erase the entire category.

What I don't see is what I need most to write a check from my own money: economic access creation for people who need it. Uber created income for drivers. Postmates created income for delivery workers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people locked out of traditional finance. ZeroSettle helps iOS developers keep a larger share of their subscription revenue. That's a legitimate efficiency gain, but it's not the kind of positive-sum impact that gets me out of bed. The "invisible system" here -- Apple's 30% commission -- is already the most visible tax in all of technology. I invest in companies that illuminate what nobody else can see. Everyone already sees this one. The cryptocurrency tag and the ZeroSettleEscrowKit repo add a layer of positioning confusion that makes me less certain about what this company actually wants to become.
