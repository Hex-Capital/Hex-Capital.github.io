# OctaPulse -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything I need to know about the thesis risk before I even get to the founders. Aquaticode has $6M, 3M+ labeled images, can process 10,000 fish per hour, and just brought on industry veteran Trond Williksen as strategic advisor. Tidal spun out of Google X with 30 billion data points across 50 million fish and 700+ pen installations. Aquabyte raised $46M. OctaPulse is a two-person team from CMU with one paid pilot and a nascent dataset. When I look at a landscape and see that multiple well-capitalized players are already executing on essentially the same insight -- "computer vision can replace manual biological inspection in aquaculture" -- the idea isn't insane. It's consensus. And when the idea is consensus, the question becomes: do these founders have such extraordinary domain positioning that they'll win a resource war against better-funded competitors? The answer here is clearly no. Neither founder has prior aquaculture experience. Their domain entry point is an MBA student's ocean conservation interest and a roboticist's technical capability. That's a project that emerged from a university program, not a decade of frustration with how fish farms actually work.

Here's what's structurally deceptive about OctaPulse from my framework's perspective: it looks like a Craftwork-style physical-world business with an AI layer on top, which is exactly my sweet spot. Fish farms are physical. Hatcheries are messy, real-world operations. But OctaPulse doesn't operate hatcheries. It doesn't employ fish technicians. It doesn't own the physical infrastructure. It sells computer vision models to people who do. Strip away the AI component and ask my standard question -- would this business exist if AI didn't? The answer is no. There's nothing here without the model. This isn't "cherry on top." This is "the cherry IS the sundae." And that's the exact category I think is most vulnerable as AI capabilities get cheaper and more accessible. A well-funded competitor or even a hatchery's in-house team with access to modern open-source vision models could replicate this capability in 12-18 months with enough labeled data, which the farms themselves generate through their daily operations.

The hatchery-first positioning is the strongest element of the pitch, and I want to engage with the bull case honestly. If OctaPulse is right that nobody is specifically solving hatchery phenotyping and deformity QA -- upstream of where Tidal and Aquabyte focus -- then there's a genuine beachhead here. Getting embedded at the hatchery stage means you're the first data touchpoint in the supply chain. In theory, that's the most valuable position because every downstream decision depends on which fish make it past QA. If OctaPulse locked in the top 10 U.S. hatcheries and built species-specific models that worked reliably before Aquaticode crossed the Atlantic, there's a land-grab narrative that could compound into something real. The 6-figure Riverence pilot is meaningful evidence that a real operator is willing to pay. For what this bull case to work, though, you'd need to believe: (1) the hatchery niche is genuinely distinct enough that grow-out-focused competitors won't bother, (2) the U.S. market can sustain a standalone business before global expansion, and (3) two grad students can out-execute a Norwegian company with 3M images and industry veterans. I don't believe any of those three things with enough conviction to write a check.

On the primitive test, OctaPulse aspires to become "the brain for future autonomous aquafarms," but aspiration isn't architecture. Nothing about their current product creates a layer that other companies build on. They're not establishing a data standard, a protocol, or an interoperability layer. They're building an application -- a very domain-specific application of computer vision to fish inspection. That's fine as a business, potentially, but it's not the kind of compounding, winner-take-most dynamic I look for in my best investments. Venmo created a new payment primitive. Solana created a new consensus layer. Helium created a new wireless network. OctaPulse creates... a faster way to check if a fish is deformed. The ceiling on that narrative is visible.

I'll give credit where it's earned: Singh's engineering background spanning ASML, Toyota, Tesla, and NVIDIA is legitimately impressive for a pre-seed technical co-founder, and having a 6-figure paid pilot with the largest U.S. trout producer at the pre-seed stage is a real accomplishment. Most YC companies at this stage are running free pilots or have signed LOIs, not collecting six figures. That revenue signal is genuine and provides a modest cushion. But one customer in one species (trout) in one geography (U.S.) does not make a platform business. It makes a vendor relationship that could easily be displaced by a competitor with deeper domain expertise or a broader species dataset.
