# Button Computer -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Button Computer isn't the product or the market -- it's that Chris Nolet founded Vibe Code Go in YC S25 and is now founding Button Computer in YC W26. Two different companies, two consecutive batches, two completely different problem spaces. When I sit down with a founder, the very first thing I want to hear is their story -- not the pitch, but the biographical thread that explains why this problem keeps them up at night, why they are uniquely forged to solve it. A founder who went from mobile vibe-coding to AI wearable hardware in the span of a few months is not telling me a story about personal obsession. That's telling me a story about opportunity-scanning, which is a different kind of founder entirely. I've learned the hard way -- through GameCrush, through watching pattern after pattern -- that when the founder's biography and the company's mission aren't inseparable, the commitment doesn't survive the first real crisis. And hardware companies always hit real crises.

The competitive landscape here also troubles me deeply, because this is the opposite of an unpopular bet. Humane raised $240 million and died. Rabbit R1 raised $30 million. Limitless got acquired by Meta. Omi is open-source at $89. Friend raised $8 million. Apple and OpenAI are both reportedly developing AI wearables. When I look at a company and see five-plus funded competitors and multiple Big Tech entrants, my instinct tells me the weirdness has been priced out of this category entirely. The deals I've loved most -- Crusoe when it was stranded gas and Bitcoin, SpaceX when private rockets were considered a billionaire's delusion -- nobody else wanted in. Here, everybody wants in. That's usually the moment I walk away, because by the time a category is consensus, the returns have shifted from outsized to incremental.

The bull case deserves honest consideration. Both founders spent years at Apple building Vision Pro and AR/VR tools, which is genuine hardware and spatial computing expertise. The insight that Humane failed because it was too expensive and too complex, and that the right product is radically simpler -- just a button you press to talk to AI -- has a certain elegance to it. There's a version of this story where the iPod Shuffle logic applies: everyone else is building the complicated thing, and the founders who strip it down to one interaction win. The $179 price point (or $79 pre-order) is meaningfully cheaper than what came before, and the bring-your-own-API-key option shows product thinking about reducing ongoing costs. If LLM inference costs keep falling and voice interaction quality keeps improving, a dead-simple hardware form factor could find real traction. I don't dismiss that possibility.

But even the bull case doesn't generate what I need to feel. I keep coming back to: who does this help? My portfolio is full of companies that created economic access where none existed. Uber put money in drivers' pockets. Postmates created income for delivery workers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out of traditional finance. Thumbtack connected skilled tradespeople with customers who needed them. Button Computer is a $179 convenience gadget for people who already own iPhones and want to talk to AI without pulling their phone out. That's a real product, but it's not creating access for anyone who lacks it. It's not making an invisible system visible or bringing transparency to an opaque power structure. When I imagine who buys this, I see tech-forward early adopters in San Francisco, not the populations whose lives I'm trying to improve through my investments.

The defensibility picture compounds my concerns. The core technology -- Bluetooth microphone, LLM API call, text-to-speech response -- is commodity. The open-source Omi project on GitHub means anyone can build essentially this product. There's no regulatory moat, no network effect, no proprietary data advantage. The two-person team needs to execute hardware manufacturing, supply chain management, software development, and AI integration simultaneously, with first shipments not until end of 2026. I've been around enough hardware companies to know that the gap between a working prototype and reliable manufactured units shipping to customers is where companies go to die -- and that's with experienced hardware teams. These founders have hardware experience from Apple, which helps, but Apple's manufacturing infrastructure is a very different thing from a two-person startup managing a supply chain.

I respect the founders' technical credentials and I think the product concept is clean and sensible. But this doesn't activate my framework on any of the dimensions I weight most heavily. No biographical imperative connecting founder to problem, no anti-consensus positioning in a crowded category, no economic access creation, no regulatory complexity creating a moat. This is a competent team chasing a popular market with a commodity technology stack. That's not the kind of bet I write checks for.
