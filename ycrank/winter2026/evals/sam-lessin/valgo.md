# Valgo -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

These founders literally wrote the textbook. Not "they know the space well" — they co-authored the MIT Press textbook on algorithmic safety validation, they teach the Stanford course on the subject, and they both worked on the core team at MIT Lincoln Laboratory that built ACAS X, the aircraft collision avoidance system that became an international standard in 2018. On the "sane" axis of my framework, Moss and Katz are about as credentialed as founders get for this exact problem. This is the kind of founder-market fit that makes you sit up. The question — and it's a big one — is whether the idea has enough non-consensus energy to generate outsized returns.

Here's where my framework creates tension. "Safety validation for autonomous systems" is not an insane idea. It's the opposite. Applied Intuition is at $15B. Foretellix just raised an $85M Series C. Every serious autonomy investor already understands that validation is critical. When I ask "is this a sane person with an insane idea, or a sane person with a sane idea?" — Valgo lands in the second category. And sane people with sane ideas is how you end up buying consensus at market price. That said, there's a subtler contrarian wager buried in here: Valgo is betting that a lightweight, black-box, simulator-agnostic algorithmic layer is more valuable than the integrated full-stack simulation environments that Applied Intuition and everyone else have built. That's a genuine architecture bet that goes against the market's revealed preference. It's not "Bitcoin will replace fiat currency" levels of insane, but it's at least mildly heretical in this space.

Where my framework genuinely lights up is the AI dynamics. I run the "cherry on top" test on every company: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? For Valgo, the answer is unambiguously yes — autonomous systems needed formal safety validation long before LLMs arrived. And AI makes the business stronger, not weaker, because AI-powered autonomy creates more complex systems that require more sophisticated validation. This is precisely the structural position I look for. AI doesn't commoditize Valgo's value proposition — it expands the customer base. Compare that to a typical SaaS company where AI erodes the moat from underneath. Valgo's customers operate in physical-world, regulated domains — aviation, defense, aerospace — where the FAA doesn't accept a demo and a pitch deck. The operational and regulatory complexity of these domains creates the kind of moat that software alone cannot replicate or commoditize.

The primitive question is the most interesting dimension. ACAS X, the system both founders helped build, literally became an international standard. If their algorithmic validation methodology follows the same path — becoming the accepted framework for certifying autonomous systems across regulated industries — then Valgo isn't selling a tool. It's establishing infrastructure. The textbook and Stanford course function almost like an open specification: they define the methodology, train the next generation of engineers, and then the company sells the production-grade implementation. That playbook has real compounding potential. But the gap between academic authority and category-defining company is enormous. The Valgorithmic GitHub has zero public repositories and four followers. There's no product to evaluate, no customers to reference, no revenue to cushion against narrative failure.

The competitive dynamics are what keep me from getting more excited. Applied Intuition raised $1.2 billion and just expanded into defense — directly overlapping Valgo's target domains. They could recruit from the same Stanford lab and build comparable algorithmic capabilities as a feature within their existing platform. And here's the structural vulnerability: the textbook that establishes Moss and Katz as the field's defining voices is also freely available in preview form. It's simultaneously their greatest marketing asset and a roadmap for competitors. This echoes a pattern I've internalized since Birchbox — intellectual authority without structural lock-in is a precarious position. The question is whether regulated industries behave differently. In aviation and defense, vendor relationships are measured in years of certification paperwork, not quarters of sales cycles. If Valgo gets embedded in one FAA certification program, that relationship compounds in ways that a competitor's war chest alone cannot replicate. The founders' ACAS X pedigree isn't just academic signaling — it's a trust signal to exactly the kind of cautious procurement officer at Boeing or Lockheed who doesn't take meetings with unknown vendors. But that's a bull case built on "if," and today there's zero evidence of any customer relationship, even exploratory.

The bull case that would make me wrong: regulated industries create the kind of sticky, non-software moats I gravitate toward, and these founders have the exact pedigree to unlock those relationships. Cross-industry algorithmic validation — the same mathematical framework applied to drones, surgical robots, spacecraft, and autonomous vehicles — could be a genuine infinity story. One defense contract or one FAA engagement changes the entire risk calculus. I'd genuinely watch this one. The founder quality is exceptional, the AI-resistant positioning is structurally sound, and the primitive potential is real. But I'm being asked to price narrative without any traction cushion, against a $15B incumbent, in a consensus market. The founders are maximally sane. I need the idea to be a little more insane.
