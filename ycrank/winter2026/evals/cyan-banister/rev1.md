# REV1 -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that hits me immediately about REV1: this is a problem that everybody already agrees is a problem. DraftAid came through YC two years ago with functionally the same pitch -- AI-generated 2D manufacturing drawings from 3D CAD files. SolidWorks shipped a beta feature for it in 2025. Siemens NX is building it into their platform. When the incumbents are already shipping your product as a checkbox feature and a direct YC-alumni competitor has paid pilots worth $150K, the consensus has already formed. And I've learned, painfully sometimes, that the most promising companies are the ones that are *not* popular and *difficult to assess*. REV1 is neither. Every mechanical engineer in the world will tell you 2D drawings are tedious. The question was never "is this a problem?" -- it's been a recognized problem for decades. That's the opposite of the signal I look for.

When I think about the founders, I see two clearly talented engineers. Alex Rivero designed motors at Tesla, worked on the iPhone 17 at Apple, built seven CNC machine prototypes for a startup he founded. Louis Liu solo-built Tesla's global Supercharger planning platform and has published ML research. These are real credentials. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I'd hear is a career narrative, not a survival story. Alex went from Barcelona to Berkeley's Fung Institute to Tesla to Apple. Louis went from the University of Toronto to AWS to Tesla. These are the trajectories of people who've succeeded inside the system, not people who've been forged by struggling against it. Alex experienced the pain point as a practitioner, and that's genuine domain expertise -- I respect that. But domain expertise and biographical stake are different things. I'm listening for the founder whose life story demands they solve this specific problem, the person who's been told "no" fifty times and keeps showing up. I don't hear that here.

To be fair to REV1, the bull case is real and I want to engage with it honestly. The accuracy bar for GD&T is genuinely high -- if you get tolerancing wrong on an aerospace part, people can die. That's a domain where Alex's hands-on Tesla and Apple experience creating these exact drawings could translate into product decisions that a pure software team would miss. DraftAid's two-year head start doesn't necessarily mean they've cracked that accuracy problem, and the incumbent beta features are explicitly described as "not intended to complete your entire drawing." If REV1 can deliver manufacturing-standard GD&T that engineers actually trust for production parts, there's a wedge. And the co-founders' shared Tesla tenure gives me some comfort about alignment -- they've seen each other operate in a high-pressure environment, which is more than many founding teams have. If I were advising them, I'd say: the only path here is to be so much better on accuracy in a specific vertical -- aerospace GD&T, or medical device tolerancing -- that engineers choose you over the incumbent checkbox feature because their parts actually come back correct. That's a real business. It's just not my kind of bet.

What I keep coming back to is that REV1 doesn't activate any of the patterns that have driven my best investments. It doesn't create economic access for people who lack it -- it makes already well-compensated mechanical engineers at Tesla and Apple marginally more productive. It doesn't make an invisible system visible -- engineering drawings are already the lingua franca of manufacturing. It doesn't operate in a stigmatized or regulated space that deters other investors -- CAD tooling is a well-understood enterprise software category. And the "weird factor" is essentially zero. When I backed Crusoe Energy, the idea of mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota sounded insane to every other investor in the room. When I think about REV1, there's no moment where I feel that jolt of intuitive energy, that sense of something others can't see yet. I see a competent team entering a validated market where the consensus is already crowded. That's a fine venture bet for someone whose framework rewards execution and timing. It's not how I invest my own money.
