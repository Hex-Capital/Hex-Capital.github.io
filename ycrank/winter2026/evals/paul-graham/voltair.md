# Voltair -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The problem with power line inspection is hiding in plain sight. The U.S. grid takes 5 to 11 years to fully inspect manually. Utilities go bankrupt from wildfire liability -- PG&E proved that isn't hypothetical. Every drone company can see this market. But the schlep of building hardware that clamps onto a live high-voltage transmission line and draws power from it -- that's the part where everyone's unconscious steps in and says "let's work on something else." Voltair walked directly into that schlep. The structure here is one I recognize: an obvious problem that persists not because nobody sees it, but because the work required to solve it is genuinely frightening. You need to build safety-critical hardware that touches energized infrastructure, get FAA approval for autonomous flights beyond visual line of sight, navigate utility procurement cycles that run longer than most startups survive, and then deploy physical charging pads across the country. Any one of those would deter most founders. All four together create something close to structural invisibility.

The organic origin is real, and it comes from the right place. Hayden Gosch spent two years doing system protection engineering at Seattle City Light and R&D at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. He was inside the utility grid, working on the infrastructure these drones would inspect. Ronan Nopp was separately building drone control systems -- he independently designed controls for a manned eVTOL while in school. The two have been friends since middle school. When a drone controls engineer and a power systems engineer who've known each other for a decade converge on the idea of a drone that charges from the lines it inspects, that's an organic intersection, not a brainstorming exercise. The idea grew from the overlap of their specific knowledge, which is how the best startup ideas tend to emerge. What tempers my enthusiasm is depth: Gosch's utility experience is two years, likely concurrent with school. I'd want this to be someone who spent a decade watching the inspection problem fester. Still, two years inside Seattle City Light is infinitely more domain knowledge than zero, and it clearly informed the specific technical approach.

These are technical founders who build. Six flying prototypes. Roughly 2,000 poles inspected. A patent-pending self-charging clamp mechanism. Nopp declined a SpaceX offer to pursue this full-time -- the kind of conviction signal that matters because SpaceX is the highest-status alternative a young aerospace engineer can have. When someone turns down SpaceX for their own startup, they're making a statement about what they believe. The team won both major UW entrepreneurship competitions in the same year, the first team to do so. They're clearly animals at building hardware. But I notice the absence of something important: there's no named customer, no revenue figure, no signed LOI. The 2,000 poles were inspected for someone -- and the contractor job posting for "Inspection Data Review – Utility Experience Required" implies active service delivery -- but who? The planned pilot on Orcas Island was supposed to happen in summer 2025, and the dossier shows no disclosed results. At pre-seed I don't expect much traction, but for a company selling to utilities, even one named pilot partner would change the calculus significantly.

The capital intensity is the part that makes me pause longest. "Fewer than 1,000 pads" for national coverage sounds efficient until you price out manufacturing, deploying, and maintaining physical infrastructure across utility territories. This is not a software company that can reach ramen profitability on a YC check and a few laptops. The path to default alive runs through significant follow-on rounds, and each round requires demonstrating progress to investors who will ask hard questions about unit economics, safety certification, and regulatory approval. The founders are 22 or 23 years old. Utility companies don't typically write purchase orders based on conversations with recent graduates. Gotskind's aerospace government affairs background -- Virgin Galactic, ExoAnalytic, Amazon Kuiper -- partially addresses the GTM gap, but partially is the operative word. The sales cycle mismatch between a fast-moving pre-seed startup and 12-to-24-month utility procurement is a genuine structural challenge.

Here's the bull case I keep returning to. If the self-charging mechanism works reliably at scale -- and six prototypes plus 2,000 inspected poles suggest it's not vaporware -- then Voltair has something no competitor can replicate through a software update. Skydio and Percepto have built their entire platforms around conventional battery architectures. Retrofitting a fleet to perch on and charge from live power lines is a fundamental hardware redesign, not an incremental improvement. The patent-pending status provides some protection. And the market timing is favorable: wildfire liability pressure is intensifying, the FAA is gradually opening BVLOS corridors, and DJI's U.S. procurement restrictions have weakened the dominant drone hardware player in exactly this sector. If Voltair lands one major utility pilot and demonstrates a working charging network, the defensibility compounds -- the installed infrastructure base creates switching costs, and the longitudinal inspection data becomes a moat of its own. This is the kind of company where if everything works, you look back and say the schlep was the moat all along.

I like the problem. I like the schlep. I like that the co-founders have known each other since middle school and that their specific technical backgrounds converge on exactly this intersection. What I don't have yet is evidence that utilities are pulling this toward them rather than the founders pushing. At this stage I'd want to have the conversation and see what happened with the Orcas Island pilot before writing a check.
