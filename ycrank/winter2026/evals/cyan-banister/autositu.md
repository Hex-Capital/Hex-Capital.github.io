# AutoSitu -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what catches my eye first: eight major U.S. cities listed on a two-person pre-seed company's website. San José, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco. If you've ever tried to sell software to a municipal government, you know that getting a single city to return your email takes months. Getting eight listed on your site before you've raised meaningful capital is either an extraordinary signal of product-pull or a very generous definition of "client." I genuinely don't know which, and the dossier doesn't clarify. But I'll say this — when I backed Flock Safety, what struck me wasn't Garrett's pitch deck; it was that he'd already gotten police departments to plug his cameras in. The distribution signal preceded everything else. If even half of AutoSitu's listed city relationships involve real deployments with real users reviewing real plans, that's a meaningful data point in a space where most startups die waiting for procurement to call them back.

But here's my problem, and it's fundamental to how I evaluate companies: I don't know these founders' stories. Xuanshu Lin went to Harvard GSD and studied urban planning. George Zhai built autonomous systems at Georgia Tech. Those are credentials, and they map well to the problem — Lin understands zoning codes because he studied them, Zhai can build the AI because he's trained in it. The domain fit is real. But when I sit down with founders, I'm not asking about their degrees. I'm asking: what happened to you that made this the thing you had to build? Did you watch a housing project you cared about die in permitting purgatory? Did you work in a planning department and feel the dysfunction in your bones? I can see why these two are qualified to build AutoSitu. I can't see why they're compelled to. And at this stage, with no revenue data, no traction metrics beyond plan sets checked, the difference between "qualified" and "compelled" is the entire bet.

What I do notice — and this is where my pattern recognition lights up — is that AutoSitu fits squarely into a category I've backed repeatedly without ever naming it explicitly: companies that make invisible systems visible. Municipal development review is one of those processes that silently shapes everyone's lived reality. Housing costs, construction timelines, neighborhood development — all of it runs through planning departments that operate as black boxes, with reviewers manually cross-referencing drawings against fragmented code books across multiple departments. Nobody outside the industry sees this machinery. It's exactly the kind of opacity I saw Carta dissolve in cap table management, that Affirm dissolved in consumer credit, that Flock Safety dissolved in public safety data. AutoSitu's Code & Precedent Graph — a structured database of jurisdiction-specific codes paired with real-world precedent — is the kind of compounding data asset that becomes a moat over time. Each new city makes the graph denser and more defensible. That's a pattern I find compelling.

The bull case for this company is genuinely strong, and I want to give it full weight. The housing crisis has created real political urgency — California's governor announced an AI permitting tool, cities are understaffed post-COVID, and the technology capability to parse architectural drawings only became viable in the last two years. The timing convergence is legitimate. AutoSitu isn't on the applicant side like PermitFlow; it's embedded in the municipal workflow itself, which is a fundamentally different buyer and a different competitive position. The jurisdictional fragmentation that makes this hard to scale is also what makes it hard to compete against — it's the same dynamic I saw at IronPort, where the complexity of security infrastructure that kept others out was the very thing that made us valuable. If AutoSitu executes, the switching costs in government procurement become a fortress. And the downstream impact — faster housing delivery during a national crisis — is the kind of real-world economic access that I believe creates durable companies.

But I keep returning to the gap. The space isn't dismissed by everyone — PermitFlow just raised $90.5 million, CivCheck got acquired, Blitz AI is winning awards, and the governor of California is announcing AI permitting tools. This is becoming consensus, not pre-consensus. I'm drawn to opportunities before the crowd arrives, and the crowd is arriving here. The technical moat — extracting structured data from drawings and checking against codes — is buildable by well-funded competitors. PermitFlow sits adjacent and could step into municipal-side review with one product expansion. I also have zero visibility into how Lin and Zhai work together, how they met, or how they navigate disagreement. After watching HQ Trivia implode despite perfect timing and product, I've learned that co-founder dynamics are load-bearing walls, not decorative trim. Two founders from different universities with no visible shared history, entering a space that will grind them down with year-long government sales cycles — I need to know how they fight before I know how they'll survive.

AutoSitu is a competent team building a real product in a space that matters. The economic access dimension genuinely resonates with me — permitting bottlenecks are one of those silent mechanisms that keep housing unaffordable, and dissolving that opacity creates value for everyone downstream. But my investment process depends on signals I can't find here: the biographical thread that makes this founder-problem connection inevitable rather than logical, the non-consensus weirdness that means I'm seeing something others have dismissed, and the co-founder stress-test evidence that tells me this team can endure the long government sales grind. I'd take the meeting. I'd ask Lin and Zhai to tell me their stories — not the business. And if what I heard gave me that visceral conviction, the calculus could shift significantly. But on what I have today, I'm not writing a check.
