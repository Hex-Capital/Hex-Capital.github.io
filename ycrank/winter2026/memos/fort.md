## The Idea

**Problem:** Existing wearables (Whoop, Garmin, Oura, Apple Watch) estimate exercise effort almost entirely through heart rate, which correlates well with cardio load (running, cycling) but fails in the weight room, where heart rate does not accurately reflect muscular effort, proximity to failure, or per-muscle stimulus (YC launch page, Feb 2026). Users who want to track strength training must manually log every rep, set, and exercise, then receive feedback that underestimates strength-related fatigue (YC company page). The target customer is health-conscious individuals focused on longevity who perform regular strength training — a segment growing rapidly, with Whoop reporting that strength workouts on its platform increased 122% YoY between 2024 and 2025 (YC launch page, Feb 2026).

**Approach:** Fort is a screenless wearable band that uses heart rate and motion data to automatically detect exercises, reps, sets, rest periods, and exercise type — no manual logging required (YC launch page). It measures velocity, range of motion, and effort from each rep, using movement kinematics and heart rate to determine muscular effort and proximity to failure per set (the5krunner, Feb 2026). The device recognizes 50+ exercises and provides per-muscle stimulus categorization (maintenance, growth, overload) and Reps In Reserve (RIR) estimates (the5krunner, Feb 2026). The band can be worn on the wrist, attached magnetically to equipment, or worn with body straps to capture motion data beyond just wrist movement (The Split podcast with Miranda Nover). The device weighs under 30g, has 7-day battery life, and also tracks sleep (deep, light, REM), HRV, recovery, VO2max estimation, steps, calories, and stress (the5krunner, Feb 2026).

**Differentiation:** Unlike Whoop ($30/month subscription model, $454M raised, $3.6B valuation — Whoop press center / getlatka via search snippet), which acquired Push (a wrist-based bar-speed tracker) in 2021 and subsequently discontinued the hardware, integrating only limited duration-based muscular load estimation into its platform (the5krunner, Feb 2026), Fort provides rep-by-rep velocity tracking, proximity to failure, and per-muscle breakdown from a single wearable. Unlike Garmin ($2.36B fitness segment revenue in FY2025 — Garmin earnings via search snippet) and Oura ($900M Series E, $11B valuation, projected >$1B 2025 revenue — CNBC/TechCrunch, Oct 2025 via search snippet), which primarily optimize for cardio, sleep, and recovery, Fort is purpose-built for strength training. Unlike Tonal ($250M+ raised, $1.6B valuation — Reuters, 2021 via search snippet) and Tempo ($398M raised — CBInsights via search snippet), which are home gym hardware systems requiring large equipment, Fort is a portable wearable. Unlike Perch ($4M raised — Fitt Insider via search snippet), which uses camera-based computer vision systems installed in gym racks for institutional customers, Fort is a consumer wearable.

**Business Model:** Pre-order price of $289 (discounted from $349 MSRP), which includes the production device plus 1 year of software access (YC company page). After the first year, expected retail pricing is $319 device + $79.99/year membership, with a free tier always available (fort.cx/order via search snippet). The discounted pre-order campaign is capped at 1,000 units (YC company page). This is a hardware + software subscription model.

**TAM/SAM:** The global fitness tracker market was valued at $62.92B in 2024 and is projected to reach $352.03B by 2033 (Straits Research via search snippet). The global smart fitness market was $64.65B in 2024 (Precedence Research via search snippet). Garmin's fitness wearable segment alone generated $2.36B in FY2025 with 33% YoY growth (Garmin earnings via search snippet). No public TAM/SAM estimate exists for the strength-training-specific wearable subsegment. [Inferred]: The serviceable market is the subset of fitness wearable buyers who regularly strength train — a growing segment given the 122% YoY increase in strength workouts reported by Whoop.

**GTM / Distribution:** Fort launched via the YC Launch page (Feb 2026) and received press coverage from Athletech News, the5krunner, Fitt Insider, Gadgets & Wearables, TheWearify, and Teknowire in February 2026. Y Combinator promoted the launch on X/Twitter (Feb 2026). The company opened pre-orders via fort.cx/order with a 1,000-unit cap at the discounted price. Miranda Nover has an active personal X/Twitter presence with ~10.6K followers (X.com via search snippet). [Inferred]: Initial distribution is DTC via the company website, leveraging founder social media presence and fitness/health media coverage.

## Defensibility

**Data moat potential:** Fort collects per-rep motion kinematics and heart rate data paired with exercise classification labels. Over time, this creates a proprietary dataset of strength training movement patterns that could improve exercise detection accuracy and personalized feedback models. This moat does not exist today but could compound with user growth.

**Hardware + software integration:** The magnetic equipment attachment and multi-placement form factor (wrist, body strap, equipment) represent a differentiated hardware approach to capturing motion data beyond wrist-only sensing. Competitors would need to replicate both the hardware design and the accompanying ML models trained on multi-placement data.

**Switching costs:** If users accumulate longitudinal strength training data (per-muscle stimulus history, velocity trends, progressive overload tracking), switching to a competitor means losing that training history.

**Market structure:** Whoop acquired Push (the closest prior product) in 2021 and discontinued the standalone hardware, integrating only a simplified muscular load feature. [Inferred]: Whoop's subscription business model ($30/month, $260M revenue — getlatka via search snippet) is optimized for broad-audience cardio/recovery tracking. Building a niche strength-specific product would require significant R&D in movement kinematics, potentially cannibalizing marketing messaging around their general-purpose positioning. Garmin and Apple face similar incentive misalignment — their strength tracking features are add-ons to platforms optimized for cardio, not primary value propositions.

**Commoditization risk:** The core technology (IMU-based exercise detection from wrist motion) is not patented in a way that prevents replication. Multiple academic papers and prior products (Push Band, RepOne) have demonstrated velocity-based training measurement from wearable sensors. A well-funded wearable company with ML expertise could build comparable exercise detection. The key barriers are: (1) the time and data needed to train models on 50+ exercises with high accuracy, and (2) the effort to design a multi-placement form factor. Neither barrier is insurmountable for a resourced competitor.

**Competitive landscape:**

| Competitor | Funding | Revenue/ARR | Key Differentiator vs. Fort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whoop** | $454M total, $3.6B valuation (Whoop press center) | $260M revenue (getlatka, Jun 2025 via search snippet) | General-purpose recovery/strain wearable with subscription model; strength tracking limited to duration-based muscular load estimates without per-rep data |
| **Oura** | $900M Series E, $11B valuation (CNBC, Oct 2025 via search snippet) | ~$500M in 2024, projecting >$1B in 2025 (Trending Topics via search snippet) | Ring form factor optimized for sleep, HRV, and readiness; minimal strength tracking; 80% hardware / 20% subscription revenue mix |
| **Garmin** | Public company (NYSE: GRMN) | $2.36B fitness segment in FY2025 (Garmin earnings via search snippet) | Broad multi-sport platform with GPS emphasis; strength tracking requires manual exercise selection; not purpose-built for weight room |
| **Tonal** | $250M+ raised, $1.6B valuation (Reuters, 2021 via search snippet) | Revenue unknown (not publicly disclosed) | Smart home gym with electromagnetic resistance and real-time adaptive coaching; large stationary equipment, not a wearable; claims 90% connected strength market share |
| **Perch** | $4M raised (Fitt Insider via search snippet) | Revenue unknown | 3D computer vision camera system for gym/institutional use; requires rack-mounted hardware; targets collegiate and professional sports teams, not consumers |

**Why now:**
- Whoop reported strength workouts on its platform increased 122% YoY between 2024 and 2025 (YC launch page, Feb 2026). For female Oura members, strength training ranked as the third most popular activity (YC launch page).
- Garmin's fitness segment grew 33% YoY in FY2025 to $2.36B (Garmin earnings via search snippet), indicating strong consumer demand for wearable fitness technology.
- [Inferred]: The longevity movement and growing body of research on strength training's role in healthspan (promoted by figures like Peter Attia, Andrew Huberman) has shifted consumer interest toward resistance exercise, creating demand for purpose-built tracking tools. Whoop's acquisition and discontinuation of Push in 2021 left a gap in the market — no wrist-worn consumer device currently offers automatic rep-by-rep velocity and effort tracking for strength training.

**Co-founder relationship:** Zac Valles and Paul Schneider both worked at Tesla and the YC page states they "designed, built, and raced electric vehicles" together, suggesting a shared university or extracurricular background. Miranda Nover also worked at Tesla on 4680 battery cells. All three founders share Tesla as a prior employer. Zac introduced Paul to Miranda in late 2024 (The Split podcast).

**Founder-market fit:** All three founders are mechanical/electrical engineers from Tesla with deep experience shipping complex hardware at scale — relevant to designing, manufacturing, and iterating on a consumer electronics wearable. Miranda's specific experience with battery cell design translates to understanding power-constrained, miniaturized hardware. Paul's sensing systems and autonomy architecture background at Tesla is directly relevant to the IMU/sensor fusion algorithms needed for exercise detection. Zac's aerospace and multi-company hardware background (SpaceX, Astranis, Rivian, Tesla) provides breadth in mechanical design and manufacturing. Miranda uses strength training personally and met Zac at a gym, suggesting authentic user-founder alignment. Banana Capital (Turner Novak) is an investor and featured Miranda on The Split podcast (thespl.it).

## Key Risks

**Accuracy validation gap:** Fort has not published independent accuracy benchmarks comparing its wrist-based velocity estimates to reference devices such as barbell-mounted linear position transducers or force plates (the5krunner, Feb 2026). Wrist-based motion tracking for barbell speed is a known technical challenge — the prior leading product (Push Band) required arm-mounted placement, and Whoop discontinued it post-acquisition. Consumer trust will depend on published validation data; without it, early adopters may churn.

**Hardware execution risk:** The device has not yet shipped (expected Q3 2026, per fort.cx). Consumer hardware startups face significant challenges in manufacturing, supply chain management, firmware iteration, and quality control. Miranda acknowledged the complexity — "mechanical hardware, electronics and sensors, firmware, phone app, backend data processing" — and the difficulty of outsourcing while retaining engineering expertise (The Split podcast). Any delays or quality issues could erode pre-order trust.

**Whoop competitive response:** Whoop acquired Push's IP and engineering team in 2021 and has the data, capital ($454M raised), and 260M revenue base to invest in improved strength tracking features. Whoop's February 2026 update already added automatic muscular load estimation. A more granular strength feature from Whoop (leveraging Push's acquired technology) could directly address Fort's differentiation.

**Brand disambiguation:** "Fort" is a common English word. Multiple companies use the name (Fort Robotics, The Fort Group, Fort financial services). The LinkedIn page appears under "fortlabs" rather than "fort." This creates SEO and brand discovery challenges, particularly for a DTC consumer product relying on organic search and word-of-mouth.

**Pre-ship DTC hardware economics:** Fort is selling hardware at $289–$349 with a $79.99/year subscription, competing against Whoop's $0-hardware/$30-month model and Oura's $299-hardware/$6-month model. [Inferred]: Unit economics for a pre-revenue hardware startup at this price point are uncertain, particularly with costs for sensors (IMU, optical HR, near-infrared spectroscopy as mentioned in The Split podcast), magnetic attachment mechanisms, and multi-placement form factor design.
