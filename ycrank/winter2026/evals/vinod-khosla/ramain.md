# RamAIn -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me about RamAIn: they're building in a space where Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are all shipping the core capability as a platform feature. Simular has $26.5 million and a Microsoft Windows 365 partnership. Browser Use has $17 million and 50,000 GitHub stars. OpenCUA, an open-source project from HKU researchers, is matching proprietary model performance on benchmarks. And RamAIn is a two-person team from IIT Delhi with a free product and no visible traction. When the platform providers and well-funded startups are all converging on the same capability simultaneously, you're not disrupting an industry -- you're entering a footrace with people who have a head start and longer legs. Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing would never happen in public telecom -- that dismissal was the signal. Nobody is dismissing computer-use agents. Everyone is building them.

Let me start where I always start: if RamAIn succeeds completely, what changes? They make enterprise workflow automation faster and more reliable across legacy desktop applications. The RPA market is $28 billion. Fine. But the consequence of full success is a better automation company -- enterprises click through legacy software faster. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The food system doesn't transform, energy generation doesn't shift, healthcare delivery doesn't restructure. They've taken what could be a massive vision -- AI that replaces all routine computer labor -- and narrowed it to "pre-trained interface-specific policies that execute 10x faster." That's an optimization on top of someone else's paradigm shift. The paradigm shift belongs to the foundation model providers. RamAIn is building the last mile. Last-mile businesses can be profitable, but the consequence of success is a business, not a transformation.

The strongest bull case is that RamAIn becomes the deployment layer that makes CUA actually work in production. The analogy would be: Anthropic builds the model, RamAIn builds the reliable enterprise product on top. UiPath's $1.43 billion in annual revenue from script-based RPA is structurally vulnerable to AI-native agents, and the business model conflict -- UiPath cannibalizing its own professional services revenue -- could slow the incumbent's response. If RamAIn's pre-training approach genuinely solves the reliability gap (current best CUA achieves only 45% on OSWorld benchmarks), they could own the enterprise CUA market. The pre-training data moat could compound as they train on more interfaces. And Vansh Ramani has real ML depth -- an ICLR 2025 publication, a contribution merged into Meta's FAISS library, CMU research. That's not a paper credential; that's demonstrated ability to produce novel research that gets adopted by major companies. The technical co-founder is genuinely strong. But the question isn't whether the team is capable. The question is whether the problem is worth their capability.

Vansh Ramani's research credentials impress me technically, and Shourya Vir Jain bootstrapped a previous company to revenue -- that demonstrates hustle. But I see no evidence of contrarian courage. They're not attempting something the consensus considers impossible. They're building in the hottest AI application category of 2025-2026, in a space where every major model provider and a dozen well-funded startups are converging. The approach -- pre-training on specific interfaces -- is a technical optimization, not a first-principles rethinking of the problem. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, nobody believed a guy from New Zealand with no aerospace pedigree could build an orbital launch vehicle. The experts laughed. Where are the experts laughing at RamAIn? The experts are building the same thing with more money.

The timing assessment reveals the core issue. Yes, CUA is on an exponential technology curve -- VLMs are crossing performance thresholds, costs are declining, open-source alternatives are proliferating. That's real. But RamAIn isn't ahead of this curve; they're arriving exactly when everyone else arrives. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was four years from mainstream awareness. When I invested in cleantech in 2004, most VCs hadn't heard of it. RamAIn is entering CUA in 2025-2026, the same year Anthropic launched Computer Use, OpenAI launched Operator, Simular raised $26.5 million, and Browser Use raised $17 million. This is consensus timing. The opportunity exists, but the window for an outsized outcome for a two-person team with no capital advantage is narrow and closing. The commoditization at the model layer is accelerating faster than any single startup can build proprietary advantage through pre-training.

I pass. These founders are technically capable -- Vansh's research output is genuinely impressive for his age, and I'd want to see what they'd do with a problem whose consequence of success matches their ability. But RamAIn is building a faster version of a capability that platform providers consider part of their core product roadmap. The consequence of success is a better enterprise automation tool in a crowded market. That's too small a target for talent this strong.
