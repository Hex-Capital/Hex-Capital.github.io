# Remy AI -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what jumps out at me before anything else: warehouse robotics is one of the most heavily funded categories in all of robotics right now. Dexterity, Nimble, RightHand, Covariant -- collectively north of $970 million raised, two unicorns minted in the last year alone. VLA models are the talk of every robotics lab from Stanford to DeepMind. This is not an unloved, misunderstood category that nobody wants to touch. It's the opposite. The most promising companies tend to be unpopular and difficult to assess -- this space is extremely popular and very well-assessed. When I see a two-person pre-seed team entering a field where the incumbents have nearly a billion dollars of capital and strategic partnerships with FedEx, ABB, and Rockwell Automation, my first question isn't about the technology. It's about why these two people, specifically, believe they can win where so many well-resourced teams are already fighting.

And that's where I hit a wall. If I were sitting across from Oscar and Ben, my first question would be: tell me how you got here. Not the business -- the story. How does an Oxford grad who spent eighteen months consulting at BCG X and a DPhil student from the Visual Geometry Group end up wanting to build robots for third-party logistics warehouses? I genuinely don't know the answer, because the dossier gives me nothing to work with. There's no biographical thread connecting these founders to the pain of warehouse work. Oscar consulted for Fortune 500 logistics companies -- that's proximity, but it's the proximity of a management consultant observing operations from the outside, not someone who has loaded trucks at 4 AM or watched a small 3PL owner struggle to compete against Amazon's automated fulfillment network. Ben's technical credentials are real -- a CVPR 2025 publication from Oxford's VGG is serious -- but academic excellence and personal stake are different things entirely. When I backed Contraline, it was because the founder had spent years in academic research on a problem nobody else cared about, and his commitment was inseparable from his identity. I don't see that inseparability here.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. The "brownfield automation for the 80% of unautomated warehouses" framing is genuinely interesting -- it reminds me of how Crusoe Energy wasn't competing with existing data centers but serving a market segment that nobody else could economically reach. If Remy AI's cost structure is truly 50% below existing solutions and they can deploy into existing workstations without facility redesign, they could unlock a segment that the unicorns structurally cannot serve. The incumbents' entire sales motion, margin structure, and engineering approach is optimized for large facilities with seven-figure budgets. Going downmarket would cannibalize their economics. That structural protection is real. And Ben Kaye's claim about data-efficient training -- if their pipeline genuinely learns new tasks with less demonstration data than vanilla VLA fine-tuning -- that's exactly the kind of technical edge you need for brownfield deployment where you can't run thousands of demonstrations at each new facility. For this to work, though, the training efficiency claim needs to be real and substantial, not incremental, and I have no way to validate it.

But I keep coming back to the same concern: there's nothing here that's difficult to assess or unpopular. Every robotics-focused VC is actively looking for the next warehouse automation bet. The brownfield angle is smart positioning, but it's still warehouse robots powered by VLA models -- the most consensus technology approach in the most consensus robotics category. When I invested in SpaceX, people thought Elon was out of his mind. When I backed Mindbloom, psychedelic therapy made investors squirm. The companies that have generated my best returns were the ones that made people uncomfortable. I don't sense that discomfort here. I also note the economic access dimension is complicated -- warehouse automation primarily displaces workers rather than creating income opportunities the way Uber did for drivers or Postmates did for delivery workers. Making smaller 3PLs more competitive is a legitimate positive-sum outcome, but it's several degrees removed from the kind of direct economic empowerment that gets me excited.

The co-founder dynamic is a question mark rather than a red flag. They share an Oxford connection and presumably overlapping years there, which gives them a common foundation. But I have no evidence they've been through real difficulty together -- a BCG consultant and a DPhil researcher who've decided to build hardware in demanding warehouse environments haven't yet encountered the kind of crisis that reveals whether a partnership can endure. And the technical depth being concentrated entirely in the CTO is a structural fragility at a two-person team that concerns me. This is a pass -- not because the founders aren't smart or the market isn't real, but because nothing here activates the signals I've learned to trust. No biographical grit that explains why this problem. No anti-consensus weirdness that scares other investors away. No visceral jolt. I wish them well, but this isn't my kind of bet.
