# Avoice -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I want to know about any founder is: how did you get here? Not the pitch, not the product -- the story. And with Avoice, that's exactly where I get stuck. Chawin Asavasaetakul has built multiple companies: WeStride in EdTech across Southeast Asia, Kinkum connecting people to unsold food in Thailand, Yindii in food surplus delivery. He published a book based on four years living with hill tribe villages in northern Thailand. These are the marks of someone who genuinely cares about waste and access -- and I find that compelling on its own. But none of it connects to architecture. Not to building codes, not to construction documentation, not to the particular pain of an architect drowning in specs and RFIs at 2 AM. When someone pivots from food surplus and education to AI-powered architectural documentation, I need to hear the thread that ties those together. Without it, I can't tell whether this is a founder who stumbled into a market opportunity or someone with a deep, unshakeable reason to solve this specific problem. And at pre-seed, that distinction is everything I'm betting on.

There's a signal here I actually like -- and it's one most investors would overlook. The two founders share a surname and almost certainly grew up together. After what happened with HQ Trivia, where a perfect product at the perfect time was destroyed by co-founder conflict, I've developed an almost allergic reaction to untested partnerships. But siblings are different. They've been resolving conflict since childhood. They know each other's rhythms, they've survived the kind of friction that breaks business partnerships. I've said before that I have a preference for family-run businesses, and a sibling founding team at a four-person pre-seed company is a quiet strength that most evaluation frameworks miss entirely.

Now, let me make the bull case honestly, because there's a version of this that works. Architecture documentation is genuinely an invisible system -- the kind of opaque, painful, unglamorous layer that sits between creative design and built reality. Architects spend disproportionate time on specs, compliance checks, QA, and coordination across disconnected PDFs and spreadsheets. Nobody dreams of fixing that, which is partly why it's still broken. If Avoice's Studio Library actually learns firm-specific practices and accumulates institutional knowledge that becomes harder to leave over time, that's a real switching-cost moat -- similar to what made Carta sticky once firms started tracking their cap tables there. WeStride's growth to a thousand customers in its first year with a 93% job placement rate shows Chawin knows how to build something people actually use. The "why now" is legitimate: multimodal LLMs have only recently become capable enough to parse architectural drawings alongside regulatory codes, and the AEC market is large enough to sustain a serious vertical SaaS business. If these founders have hired architecture domain experts on their four-person team -- people I can't see in the public record -- and if there's a biographical connection to this problem that just hasn't surfaced, this could be a meaningful company.

But I have to invest based on what I can see, not what I hope is true. The core issue isn't that Avoice is a bad idea -- it's a reasonable one. And that's the problem for how I invest. "AI for vertical documentation" is one of the most well-trodden playbooks in the current cycle. Swapp has $18.5M and is already automating construction documentation. Monograph has $49M and 12,000 users in the same customer base. This is not a category where investors are running scared -- it's a category where capital is actively flowing. The most promising companies in my experience are the ones that are not popular and difficult to assess. Avoice is neither. An investor looking at this space can immediately understand the value proposition, map the competitive landscape, and size the market. That legibility is exactly what makes me less excited, not more.

The domain complexity of architecture -- building codes, CSI MasterFormat, professional liability, coordination workflows -- is real, and I respect founders who wade into hard spaces. But without documented domain expertise on the founding team, I'm left wondering who on this four-person team actually knows whether a specification is correct or a code compliance flag is a false positive. Architecture firms have professional liability on the line. They won't trust AI-generated documentation from a team that can't demonstrate deep understanding of their standards and stakes. This isn't like EdTech where you can iterate fast and learn alongside customers -- a misinterpreted building code has consequences in the physical world. The Autodesk incumbent risk compounds this: Autodesk already owns the relationship with architects through Revit and AutoCAD, and adding documentation intelligence features is a natural extension for them.

I keep coming back to the same question: would I drop everything to work for these founders? Chawin is clearly talented -- Stanford, multiple startups, the kind of restless builder energy I recognize and admire. But I can't find the biographical conviction that tells me he'll grind through the inevitable moments when architecture firms are slow to adopt, when Autodesk announces a competing feature, when the first liability concern surfaces. The founders who survive those moments are the ones solving a problem that's personally theirs. This feels more like a smart application of current technology to an underserved vertical -- and there are many investors well-suited to that bet. I'm just not one of them.
