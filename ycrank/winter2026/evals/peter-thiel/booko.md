# Booko -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most revealing fact about Booko is that its entire value proposition depends on API access to platforms that have every incentive to either replicate its functionality or cut it off. Mindbody already implements dynamic pricing through ClassPass. Vagaro just acquired Schedulicity, consolidating its scheduling empire. Acuity sits inside Squarespace. Booko is building a house on someone else's land, and the landlords are actively expanding into the backyard. This is not a monopoly position -- it is a feature request waiting to be fulfilled by an incumbent with existing customer relationships, existing booking data, and zero integration friction. A company whose existence can be eliminated by a product manager's sprint planning session at Mindbody does not pass the durability test at any stage.

But the deeper problem is more fundamental: there is no secret here. "Perishable inventory should be dynamically priced" is a truth that everyone agrees with. Airlines have practiced yield management since American Airlines built SABRE in the 1980s. Hotels do it. Uber does it. ClassPass already does it for fitness studios. The observation that hair salons and med spas leave money on the table with static pricing is correct, but it is correct in the way that "people want food delivered" is correct -- it is consensus, and consensus truths do not create monopolies. When I ask "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?", the answer here would be something like "service businesses should use dynamic pricing." Try saying that at any business school or revenue management conference and count the disagreements. You will count zero.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Mindbody faces a genuine channel conflict: their dynamic pricing operates through ClassPass, which charges businesses a 20% marketplace commission on transactions. Building a B2B-side dynamic pricing tool would cannibalize that commission stream. This structural tension could theoretically create a window where Booko captures the market before Mindbody resolves its internal contradiction. If Booko accumulates enough cross-business utilization data, it could develop demand prediction models that improve with scale -- a data flywheel that becomes harder to replicate over time. And the founders have some relevant signal: Arjun Saluja worked on dynamic pricing systems at Joby Aviation, which is at least domain-adjacent experience. In a world where Booko moves fast enough to integrate with thousands of service businesses before the incumbents react, and where the data flywheel kicks in before competitors can match prediction accuracy, you could imagine a valuable company. But "you could imagine" is the operative phrase. This is an indefinite optimism argument -- things might work out if several conditions align -- not a definite plan for how dominance is achieved.

The technology fails the 10x test by a wide margin. ML-based demand prediction for pricing optimization is commoditized infrastructure at this point. The claimed 15-25% revenue uplift is a meaningful business outcome for customers, but it represents incremental optimization, not discontinuous capability. Nothing about the underlying technology -- API integrations with booking platforms, machine learning models trained on utilization data -- creates a structural barrier that a well-resourced competitor could not replicate within a single engineering quarter. This is a "1 to n" application of existing yield management principles to a new vertical. The next generation of pricing innovation will not come from applying airline revenue management concepts to hair salons.

The go-to-market compounds these concerns. The website simultaneously targets fitness studios, med spas, salons, consultants, tax accountants, and event venues. This is the opposite of a monopoly-building beachhead strategy. Facebook started with Harvard. PayPal started with eBay power sellers. Booko starts with... everyone who sells time slots. Targeting a broad, generic category on day one signals competitive thinking -- the founders are trying to address the largest possible market rather than completely dominating a specific, narrow segment first. And the enterprise sales motion required to convince multi-location service businesses to integrate a pricing layer from a two-person pre-seed startup, led by early-career founders with no visible enterprise sales track record, makes the path to even that broad market uncertain.

This is a competent application of well-understood economic principles to an underserved vertical, built by founders with relevant but early-career backgrounds, on a technology stack that offers no structural differentiation, atop platforms controlled by potential competitors. It is a reasonable small business. It is not a zero-to-one company, and it does not have a path to the kind of returns that justify the risk of early-stage investment. The power law demands that every investment have the potential to return the entire fund. A pricing optimization SaaS layer for service businesses, even if perfectly executed, does not reach that threshold.
