# Sponge -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Sponge is that it's competing with its own parents. Three engineers who built Stripe's stablecoin payment systems left to build payment infrastructure for AI agents -- and Stripe itself shipped an Agentic Commerce Suite the same month. That's not a coincidence. It means the problem is real. But it also means the problem is visible to exactly the people with the most resources to solve it. When the Collisons started Stripe, no one else was building the developer-friendly payment API. When Sponge starts, Stripe, Coinbase, Visa, Mastercard, and at least five funded startups are all building agent payment products simultaneously. This is the opposite of schlep blindness. This is a problem everyone can see.

I wrote in 2025 that the most impressive YC companies I'd seen so far were not working on AI. Sponge is a good illustration of why. "Financial infrastructure for the agent economy" is a category, not a discovery. Every payments company and every crypto company looked at autonomous AI agents in 2024 and independently concluded that agents would need wallets. Catena Labs raised $18M from a16z. Skyfire raised $9.5M. Natural raised $9.8M. Payman raised $13.8M. Coinbase shipped AgentKit with 50 million transactions. The question isn't whether agent payments are a real market -- it clearly is. The question is whether a YC-stage company with $500K can win a race against eight competitors who collectively have over $50M in funding plus three of the world's largest payment networks. When the schlep doesn't deter anyone, the schlep isn't a moat.

The strongest thing about this team is the founder-market fit. These three didn't read about agent payments on TechCrunch -- they were building the stablecoin infrastructure at Stripe when agents started needing financial primitives. That's more organic than brainstorming, and I give them credit for it. The fiat-plus-crypto hybrid approach is a genuinely differentiated architectural choice; most competitors picked one rail or the other. And the Gateway product -- upload your API spec and let agents onboard and pay without code changes -- is a clever wedge that none of the competitors seem to have. If I squint, I can see the bull case: Stripe focuses on enterprise merchants (URBN, Etsy, Ashley Furniture), leaving a structural gap at the developer and SMB layer. Sponge's SDK and MCP integrations target exactly that gap. If agent commerce grows at anything close to the projected $136 billion, and if Stripe's enterprise focus creates a durable opening, a developer-first infrastructure play could work. That's the bet.

But it requires Stripe to stay upmarket, which is not what Stripe does. Stripe's entire history is expanding from a developer wedge into everything else. Betting that Stripe will leave a developer-facing gap in payments infrastructure is like betting a river will stop flowing downhill. And the regulatory schlep -- KYC/AML for autonomous agents, money transmitter licensing, liability for unauthorized agent transactions -- is the kind of complexity where having a16z's legal network (as Catena Labs does) or Coinbase's compliance infrastructure matters more than having a better SDK. The competitive dynamics here don't favor the smallest, least-funded player. They favor the one with the deepest regulatory relationships and the largest existing merchant base.

Three technical founders from Stripe who've already shipped a working product with multi-chain support and framework integrations -- that's real. They can build. That much is clear from the live dashboard, the TypeScript SDK, and the MCP support. But I see no evidence of user pull. No revenue, no customer names, no usage metrics, no organic adoption signal beyond 17 YC Launch upvotes. At pre-seed I don't demand traction, but I look for any sign that someone needs this product specifically, and I don't see it. When every competitor is building the same category and none of them have published meaningful transaction volumes either, it raises a deeper question: maybe the market for autonomous agent payments doesn't exist yet at any meaningful scale. Maybe it's a market that everyone is building for but nobody is buying from.

I'd describe these founders as competent and well-positioned, but I wouldn't describe them as relentlessly resourceful -- at least not from what's visible here. They saw an opportunity at the intersection of their expertise and a trend, and they executed on it quickly and well. That's smart engineering. What I don't see is the animal quality -- the signal that they'd keep building this even if no one funded them, that they'd find creative ways around obstacles that would stop most people. The Stripe pedigree tells me they can build infrastructure. It doesn't tell me they'll outrun eight better-funded competitors in a consensus market. This is a pass for me, though I'd pay attention to what happens in six months. If they find the developer wedge that Stripe misses and get actual usage, the picture changes considerably.
