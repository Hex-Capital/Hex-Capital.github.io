# 1code (21st.dev) -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Here is a company building a visual wrapper around Claude Code and OpenAI Codex — and OpenAI shipped its own visual wrapper for Codex the same month these founders entered YC. That's the fact that dominates everything else about this company. Platform dependency isn't a future risk to monitor; it's a present condition to survive. When your product is an orchestration layer on top of someone else's agent, and that someone has ten thousand engineers and every incentive to build the orchestration themselves, you're not in a startup — you're in a race you structurally cannot win through speed alone.

The origin of this idea concerns me. These founders built nine products in ten months. That's impressive velocity, but it's also the signature of founders who generate ideas rather than discover them. The pivot path goes: component marketplace, then MCP tool for Cursor, then coding agent orchestration. Each product follows the heat of the moment rather than pursuing a problem the founders couldn't stop thinking about. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the honest answer appears to be "they noticed AI coding agents were exploding and saw a gap in the tooling." That's market analysis, not lived experience. Contrast this with Dropbox — Drew Houston didn't analyze the file storage market. He kept forgetting his USB drive. The pain came first, then the company. Here, the category came first. The problem 1code addresses — managing multiple coding agent sessions — is real, but it's also the kind of problem that every developer tool company in the space will solve as a feature within their existing product. There's no schlep hiding this opportunity from view. The absence of regulatory complexity, logistical nightmares, or deeply technical barriers means the idea is visible and accessible to everyone — which is exactly why OpenAI, Cursor, and a dozen open-source projects are already building it.

The bull case is that these founders execute faster than anyone. Nine products, two acquisitions, Sergey accepted to YC at nineteen, experience at Deel, a Cambridge hackathon win. If the coding agent ecosystem fragments — if developers end up using five different agents and need a single control plane — then the team that ships fastest and builds the strongest open-source community could own that layer. The 5,000 GitHub stars in a short window show real developer interest. And the $20/$100 monthly pricing is sensible for a developer tool. If you believe the architecture of AI coding will be agents-plus-orchestration rather than monolithic IDEs, 1code is well-positioned. The open-source approach creates genuine switching costs once teams build automation workflows around the API. That's a real thesis, and I don't dismiss it.

But I don't believe it's the likely outcome. Cursor already has a billion in ARR by doing the opposite — embedding the agent inside the IDE rather than orchestrating external agents. The market appears to be converging on integrated environments, not disaggregated layers. And the "visual UI for a CLI tool" portion of 1code's value proposition has essentially zero technical moat. The deeper automation features — Linear integration, PR review, CI/CD resolution — provide more differentiation, but these are replicable features, not structural advantages. The co-founder relationship also gives me pause: no shared prior employer or university that I can see, which fits the pattern of founders who met specifically to start a company rather than people who already knew each other deeply.

Where these founders genuinely shine is as technical builders. Sergey in particular — eight years of engineering, multiple shipped products with paying users, first engineer at a company that hit $120K ARR in four months. Both founders clearly write code themselves and ship real software. That's the one dimension where this team is unambiguously strong. But technical ability alone doesn't override a weak strategic position. The best programmer in the world can't outbuild Anthropic and OpenAI adding native UIs to their own products.

The traction numbers require careful reading. The "1 million users" and "$200K revenue" figures appear to aggregate across all nine prior products, not 1code specifically. The 1code-specific signal is 5,000 GitHub stars and an unknown fraction of that revenue. Stars measure curiosity, not dependency. Nobody's livelihood depends on 1code the way early Airbnb hosts depended on the platform to make rent. That's the difference between buzz and pull.
