# One Robot -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me immediately about One Robot: the competitive landscape reads like a list of organizations I would never want to compete against with $500K and two people. NVIDIA is giving away Isaac Sim under Apache 2.0 and has Cosmos trained on 20 million hours of data. Runway has $860 million and just launched GWM Robotics. Google DeepMind is building this internally. And One Robot's response is to focus on deformable-object manipulation -- textiles, box folding, flexible materials. That's a technically valid niche, but it raises a question I always ask: is the niche a beachhead for something transformational, or is it a corner the founders retreated into because the center of the field is occupied? When the incumbents and well-funded competitors validate the general approach and you're differentiating on a specific material class, that's not the dynamic I look for. My best investments have been in companies the incumbents mocked, not companies hiding in the incumbents' blind spots.

The consequence-of-success question is where this evaluation really lands. If One Robot succeeds completely -- dominates task-specific world models for manipulation training -- what changes? Robotics teams train VLA policies faster and cheaper. That's a genuine efficiency gain for an important industry. But it's a developer tool for robot builders, not a transformation of how physical systems operate. The robotics simulation market is projected at $4.2 billion by 2033. Even capturing a significant share of that is a mid-market outcome, not a civilization-scale one. Compare this to what I look for: Impossible Foods targeting $1.7 trillion in animal agriculture, Commonwealth Fusion targeting fossil fuel generation, Square replacing the entire point-of-sale infrastructure. One Robot is making an existing R&D workflow faster. That's the kind of company where the founders have reduced the probability of failure -- simulation for robotics is clearly needed -- but the consequence of success doesn't justify the magnitude of effort I want to see from people this capable.

Both founders are deeply credentialed robotics and ML engineers. Hemanth has dual master's degrees from Georgia Tech with 4.0 GPAs, an Early Career Achievement Medal from NASA JPL, time at Google, and bootstrapped a geospatial AI company to profitability. Elton spent five years at Tesla building factory automation and Dojo infrastructure. They worked together at Industrial Next, a YC W22 robotics manufacturing company. These are serious people. But this is precisely the pattern I flag: industry insiders building what the industry tells them it needs. Every signal suggests they identified the data bottleneck from direct experience at Tesla and Industrial Next, and they're building the obvious solution. There's no outsider irreverence here, no attempt at something the consensus considers crazy. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, nobody in aerospace took a New Zealander seriously. One Robot's founders are the aerospace veterans building the next-generation wind tunnel. Competent and needed, but not the kind of contrarian bet that produces 100x outcomes.

The bull case deserves honest engagement: VLA models are on an exponential trajectory right now, and the gap between data requirements and physical collection capacity is widening at an accelerating rate. If task-specific world models for deformable objects represent a genuinely distinct technical problem -- one that general-purpose simulators cannot absorb even as they improve -- then One Robot could become essential infrastructure for manipulation robotics the way TSMC became essential for semiconductors. The founders' combined experience at Tesla, NASA JPL, and Industrial Next gives them legitimate domain expertise in exactly the problem they're solving. And the timing is real: world models crossed a feasibility threshold in 2024-2025, VLA models are proliferating, and the data bottleneck is becoming acute. If I believed that task-specific deformable-object simulation is a durable moat rather than a temporary gap in general-purpose tools, this would be a different evaluation.

But I don't believe that. The history of specialized simulation tools getting absorbed by platform players is long and consistent. NVIDIA's entire business model is providing the horizontal infrastructure layer that subsumes vertical solutions. When a trillion-dollar company is giving away the general-purpose version of your product for free and actively improving it, your task-specific differentiation has a half-life measured in quarters, not decades. The founders would need to be building something that gets more defensible over time -- a genuine data flywheel where task-specific robot experience creates compounding advantages. Maybe that exists, but there's no evidence of customer validation, no traction data, no sim-to-real transfer results. At this stage I see two talented engineers building a tool the market will commoditize before they can establish a moat around it.
