# RunAnywhere -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here is what jumps out first. On-device AI deployment tooling is a market where Meta shipped ExecuTorch to 1.0 GA in October 2025, Google maintains MediaPipe with LLM inference APIs, Apple continues investing in MLX and Core ML, and Nexa AI -- a direct competitor founded two years earlier -- already has $3.4M in revenue, a 31-person team, and $8-16M raised. When I map who's building what, this isn't PagerDuty entering a space nobody cared about. This is a two-person team entering a market where three of the largest technology companies on earth are actively investing in open-source tooling that overlaps directly with the free SDK layer. The market is real. The question is whether there's a structural opening for a startup.

The structural opening, if it exists, is in the control plane layer -- OTA model delivery, policy-based routing, fleet analytics, A/B testing across heterogeneous device fleets. This has some of the "boring but critical infrastructure" energy I look for. Meta and Google monetize through cloud services and advertising, which creates genuine business model misalignment: a paid tool that helps enterprises run AI on-device instead of calling cloud APIs could cannibalize their inference revenue. Apple controls the iOS runtime but hasn't shown interest in building cross-platform fleet management for Android and web. That misalignment is real and structural -- it's the same dynamic that prevented AWS from building great multi-cloud tooling. If RunAnywhere can establish the control plane as the operational standard before incumbents overcome their incentive conflicts, there's a wedge here. But this is a softer moat than regulatory barriers or deep technical IP. It's a bet on organizational inertia at big tech, which has a mixed track record as a durable advantage.

The timing thesis deserves credit. Small LLMs crossed a genuine quality threshold in 2024-2025 -- Llama 3.2 at 1B and 3B parameters, Phi-3 mini, Gemma 2B all made local inference viable for production applications, not just demos. Device NPUs from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek now deliver enough TOPS for real-time inference. Privacy regulations are creating compliance pressure to process data locally. Cloud API costs remain high at scale. These are real structural changes, not speculative. The problem is that everyone can read the same adoption curve. This market isn't "too boring" or "too niche" -- on-device AI is consensus among infrastructure investors. Grand View Research projecting the edge AI software market from $1.95B to $8.91B by 2030 at 29% CAGR tells me this is exactly the kind of market where TAM slides show big numbers and 20+ funded competitors pursue similar approaches. I've seen great inflection points generate terrible startup outcomes when the inflection is obvious to incumbents too.

The execution velocity from this two-person team is the strongest positive signal in the dossier. 1,663 commits on the SDK repo, cross-platform coverage across iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and web browsers, working demo apps on both app stores, and 9,000 GitHub stars -- all shipped by two people. That's real builder output. For comparison, 9K stars on an open-source SDK at pre-seed shows developers are finding and trying the tool. The breadth of platform coverage creates integration surface area that's time-consuming to replicate, even if any individual component is technically reproducible. Sanchit's Intuit experience provides mobile SDK context, and Shubham's AWS distributed systems background is directly relevant to the control plane architecture. These are competent infrastructure engineers who ship fast. What I don't see is deep ML research experience or prior edge deployment expertise that would give them a technical edge that compounds -- the kind of domain depth that Harvey's founders had in legal workflows.

The bull case I'd want to be true: RunAnywhere becomes the Stripe of on-device AI. The SDK creates developer relationships (like Stripe's payment API), the control plane monetizes fleet management (like Stripe expanded to Billing, Atlas, Treasury), and the incumbents' business model conflicts prevent them from building the commercial layer. In this scenario, every mobile app that runs local AI uses RunAnywhere's SDK, and every enterprise managing on-device AI across device fleets pays for the control plane. The 9K GitHub stars are the leading indicator, and the market grows 5-10x as on-device AI becomes standard rather than niche. For this to work, three things need to be true simultaneously: the SDK must win developer preference over ExecuTorch and llama.cpp wrappers, free users must convert to paid control plane customers at viable rates, and the team must build enterprise sales capacity from a two-person base. That's more miracles than I'm comfortable with. Each is achievable individually, but the compounding probability of all three in the face of well-resourced competition brings the odds down below my threshold.

I'm passing. The structural moment for on-device AI is real, and the execution velocity is impressive for a two-person team. But this is a consensus-hot market where platform companies are actively building, a funded competitor already has meaningful revenue, and the control plane differentiation -- while structurally sound -- hasn't been validated with a single paying customer. The founders are competent infrastructure engineers but lack the domain edge or prior operating experience that would give me conviction they can out-execute a 31-person competitor with a two-year head start. I want to see the market where competent execution in a structural moment can win. Here, I see a market where you need to beat Meta's open-source team, Google's ML infrastructure group, and a funded competitor simultaneously. That's not one miracle -- it's several.
