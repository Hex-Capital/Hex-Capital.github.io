# Docura Health -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells me everything I need to know about where this company sits. Supio has raised $91 million. Wisedocs is doing $14.4 million in revenue with 116 employees. DigitalOwl was acquired by Datavant for enterprise distribution. Stream Claims took $5.3 million from Spark Capital. And into this crowded ring walks a solo founder with a UC Berkeley CS degree, internship experience at Rivian and Salesforce, and a Chrome extension with one install. When I see a space this well-funded, I ask a blunt question: what does this founder know that the teams deploying tens of millions of dollars don't? I can't find the answer in this dossier. The physician-facing angle is a real gap in the market -- most competitors serve lawyers and insurers -- but a gap is not a moat, and a $91 million competitor can walk through that gap whenever they choose to.

Let me start where I always start: consequence magnitude. If Docura Health succeeds completely -- captures every QME and IME physician doing workers' comp evaluations -- what happens? Physicians write their medico-legal reports in 30 minutes instead of several hours. Settlement timelines compress. Case volumes double. That's genuinely useful for the physicians and the injured workers waiting on evaluations. But the workers' compensation system continues to function exactly as it does today. Insurers still adjudicate claims. Lawyers still litigate. Physicians still perform examinations. Nothing becomes obsolete. The entire industry structure remains intact, just with a faster report-writing step. This is a workflow efficiency tool targeting a narrow professional segment within a $56.7 billion market. The consequence of success is a nice niche SaaS business -- not the kind of outcome that justifies my attention or my capital.

The technology here doesn't disrupt -- it digitizes. AI-generated medical record summaries and chronological extraction are increasingly table stakes. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the core capability of AI-generated medical record summaries is increasingly commoditized." The AMA Guides impairment rating automation (5th and 6th Edition) is the most specialized feature, and it's genuinely technical -- but it's a feature, not a platform. Any competitor with a medical informatics hire and the AMA Guides manual can build this. There's no physics breakthrough here, no fundamental technology that makes the incumbent approach uneconomic. Manual review by nurses and legal consultants will get squeezed on margins, sure, but the disruption pattern is "slightly cheaper and faster," not "structurally obsolete." Compare this to Square, which didn't make cash registers 30% faster -- it made the entire POS infrastructure irrelevant for millions of merchants who couldn't access it. That's disruption. This is automation.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: the physician-facing workflow is a wedge into owning the entire medico-legal data layer. If you process enough cases, you accumulate structured outcome data -- impairment ratings linked to diagnoses linked to treatment histories linked to settlement amounts. That data could power settlement prediction, fraud detection, claims adjudication algorithms. You stop being a report-writing tool and become the intelligence layer for the entire workers' comp system. The timing is real -- LLMs genuinely crossed a capability threshold for processing thousands of pages of unstructured medical records in 2023-2024. And physician burnout creates real demand pull. For this to work, though, you'd need a founder with both the technical capability to build the AI and the domain knowledge to navigate HIPAA, AMA licensing, and state-specific workers' comp regulations -- or at minimum, a co-founder who brings that domain expertise. Instead, we have a solo founder whose prior AI venture (Siff AI) lasted eight months before being discontinued, with no medical or legal background, no identified advisors, and no hiring plans. The team composition doesn't match the venture's regulatory and domain complexity.

The timing argument cuts both ways. Yes, LLMs enable this category now. But when seven funded companies are already building AI medical record review tools, you're not skating to where the puck will be -- you're skating to where a crowd has already gathered. I look for bets where the experts dismiss the idea and the outsiders haven't crowded in. Here, the venture capital market has already validated this category with over $150 million deployed across competitors. There's no contrarian signal. Nobody is telling this founder the idea is crazy; they're telling him he's late and undercapitalized.

I pass. The founder may be talented -- the OCR and ML projects on GitHub suggest relevant technical instincts, and pivoting from a failed venture to a new one shows persistence. But talent deployed against a problem whose consequence of success is modest produces modest outcomes. Making physicians write reports faster is a fine business idea. It's not my kind of bet. I'd tell this founder the same thing I tell every smart engineer building workflow automation in a crowded space: you're capable of attempting something far more ambitious than this. Find a problem where success means the world works differently, not where success means one professional group saves a few hours per week.
