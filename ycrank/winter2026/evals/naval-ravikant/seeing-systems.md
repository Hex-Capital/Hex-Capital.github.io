# Seeing Systems -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the capital asymmetry, and it's not the kind I usually find interesting. When I backed Uber at $4M, the incumbents were taxi medallion holders -- bureaucratic, technologically inert, unable to respond at the speed of software. Here, the incumbents are Anduril at $28B, Helsing at €12B, and Shield AI at $5.3B -- all building autonomous drone systems with billions in capital and deep technical teams. Seeing Systems has $500K. In a software business, that asymmetry can be irrelevant because code provides infinite leverage -- one great engineer can outbuild a thousand mediocre ones. But this is a hardware business. Every drone requires atoms: manufacturing, supply chain, military-spec quality assurance, physical delivery. Atoms don't have zero marginal cost. The leverage ratio is structurally constrained in a way that works against the small team, and that's the fundamental tension I can't resolve.

The specific knowledge, though, is real. Alexander Le Maitre didn't read about defense procurement in a McKinsey report -- he built EOD training and diagnostic hardware at Wildcat I.S. that NATO forces, Special Forces, and European military units actually use in the field. That's the kind of knowledge that accumulates through years of building physical things for operators who will die if the hardware fails. You can't teach that in a classroom. The fact that UK Royal Marine Commandos and four NATO forces are already engaged as customers and partners at the prototype stage -- for a two-person pre-seed company -- is the direct evidence that this knowledge converted into trust. In defense, trust is the scarcest resource. It takes years to build and can't be purchased with venture capital. Matthew's profile complements well: Cambridge top-ranked CS, Jane Street (which selects for the kind of rigorous systems thinking that autonomous control demands), and a dissertation specifically on autonomous vehicle simulation. The brother dynamic reminds me of the Collisons at Stripe -- shared context since childhood, natural long-term alignment, low communication overhead. As a founding team for this specific problem, they're genuinely hard to replicate.

Where my framework breaks down on this company is leverage architecture. My best investments -- AngelList, Notion, Replit, CoinList -- all share a common structure: software that multiplies individual capability, where one engineer's work serves millions of users with near-zero marginal cost. Seeing Systems is building integrated hardware+software sold through government procurement. Each sale requires a physical product, each customer requires relationship management through bureaucratic procurement cycles, and scaling requires manufacturing capacity and working capital. The agentic AI control system is the potential leverage component -- if the software becomes the real product and the modular hardware becomes interchangeable, you get something closer to Shield AI's Hivemind model, where autonomy software is the platform and hardware is commodity. But they're not positioning that way. They're positioning as an integrated system. That's the right short-term strategy for winning military contracts, but it means the business scales linearly with production capacity, not exponentially with code.

The timing is also working against my framework. "Autonomous drones for defense" is one of the most consensus investment theses in technology right now. European defense spending is at generational highs. Germany awarded €900M in kamikaze drone contracts. Defense tech startups had their best funding year ever in 2025. When every LP, every fund, and every government is saying the same thing -- that autonomous drones are the future of warfare -- the Efficient Markets Hypothesis starts to bite. The pricing already reflects optimism. Now, there's a slight contrarian angle in the specific positioning: a tiny UK startup from Guernsey building the low-cost expendable segment while well-funded competitors chase larger, more expensive platforms. Stark's Virtus loitering munition failing all four military trial strikes with $62M in funding and Sequoia backing tells you that capital alone doesn't win this market. But "we're the scrappy version of the well-funded players" isn't the same as "smart people think we're wrong."

The bull case I have to honestly consider: Europe's defense procurement surge is a once-in-a-generation catalyst, not a hype cycle. The large primes -- Lockheed, BAE, Northrop -- face genuine structural misalignment with cheap expendable drones because their business models depend on expensive, high-margin platforms. This creates a real vacuum that startups can fill. Alexander's existing military relationships provide distribution that money can't buy. If the agentic control system proves superior in contested electromagnetic environments -- GPS-denied, heavy electronic warfare -- and the modular hardware approach allows rapid iteration that rigid competitors can't match, Seeing Systems could become the standard low-cost autonomous platform for NATO's European forces. The ePlane Company in my portfolio represents a similar bet: deep-science hardware outside my usual geography, funded on conviction about physics-enabled disruption. If Seeing Systems is the infrastructure layer for European expendable autonomous drones, the compounding happens through operational data from real deployments, iterative feedback from elite military operators, and procurement switching costs that lock in relationships for decades.

But I keep coming back to the leverage question. My portfolio's deepest conviction bets -- the ones that generated 100x+ -- all had the property that the business got dramatically better without proportionally more people or capital. Stack Overflow's knowledge graph compounded with every question. Notion's platform compounded with every template. Bitcoin compounded with every node. I don't see that mechanism here. The technology may compound -- each deployment generates data that improves the autonomy software -- but the business requires physical manufacturing, physical delivery, and physical support for each incremental unit of revenue. I respect the founders, I believe in their specific knowledge, and I think the military customer relationships are genuinely valuable. But this is an atoms business in a consensus market with terrifying capital asymmetry, and my framework is built to identify leverage in bits.
