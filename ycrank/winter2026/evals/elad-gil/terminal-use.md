# Terminal Use -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells me everything I need to know about whether this is my kind of bet. Terminal Use is building agent deployment infrastructure in a market where E2B has raised $21M and claims 88% of the Fortune 100, Daytona has raised $31M and reached $1M ARR in under three months, Modal Labs has $111M and a $1.1B valuation, and Vercel -- the company Terminal Use literally names itself after -- is actively launching agent hosting with Fluid compute and an installed base of millions of developers. This is the opposite of a non-obvious market. When I invested in PagerDuty, other investors thought operations alerting was boring. When I backed Coinbase, crypto seemed speculative and personally unfamiliar to most VCs. Those markets triggered dismissive reactions. Agent infrastructure in early 2026 triggers the exact opposite reaction -- every developer tools investor I know is writing checks here. The market is real, but the structural moment is consensus. There's no gap between how this market looks today and where it's heading, because every well-capitalized infrastructure company has already mapped the same adoption curve.

The positioning problem compounds the competitive problem. "Vercel for background agents" is a tagline that works until Vercel decides to be Vercel for background agents -- which they already have. Vercel launched Agent capabilities in Beta with Fluid compute specifically designed for persistent workloads, agent SDKs, and the Skills.sh ecosystem. When your competitive positioning is "X for Y" and X is already building Y, you've defined yourself as a feature of someone else's platform, not a platform of your own. The filesystem-specific wedge is technically interesting but architecturally fragile -- if agent frameworks evolve toward stateless, API-based patterns (which is the natural direction as the ecosystem matures and abstractions improve), the core value proposition narrows. The dossier itself notes that "the core technical components -- container orchestration, filesystem isolation, CLI tooling -- are well-understood infrastructure patterns." This is an integration play, not a technology play.

The distribution picture concerns me most. I see zero evidence that the founders have thought about distribution beyond "CLI-first and developers will find us." No Product Hunt launch. No community. GitHub repositories with zero to one stars. No public user counts, revenue, or waitlist data. Compare this to Daytona reaching $1M ARR in under three months or E2B's Fortune 100 penetration. The CLI-first approach is a product decision, not a distribution strategy. I've written extensively about how almost every company that reaches tens of billions in market cap has been aggressive about distribution from their earliest days. When I consulted with Dylan Field at Figma in 2016, what impressed me wasn't just the product -- it was the strategic clarity about how the browser-based design tool would become a distribution channel for collaboration workflows. I see no analogous thinking here. What's the multi-product vision? How does agent deployment become a channel for additional products? The dossier shows a single product with no articulated platform trajectory.

The strongest bull case is the Palantir pedigree. All three co-founders worked at Palantir, and Vivek Raja specifically led the technical delivery of "one of the largest agent use cases across US hospitals." That's not generic infrastructure experience -- that's direct domain exposure to the exact challenges of deploying agents in production environments with real compliance and reliability requirements. The co-founder relationship was forged at a shared employer and university, which reduces the co-founder conflict risk I worry about at pre-seed. If I squint, I can see a version of this where the Palantir team's understanding of enterprise agent deployment gives them an opinionated platform advantage that the sandbox-focused competitors (E2B, Daytona) and general-compute players (Modal) miss -- particularly around enterprise data isolation and the full agent lifecycle from eval to A/B testing. The "build, evaluate, deploy, A/B test, generate evals from production" lifecycle is a more complete vision than just sandboxes or compute.

But that bull case requires Terminal Use to win a distribution race against competitors with 10-50x more capital, established developer relationships, and measurable traction -- all in a market where switching costs are low because the underlying infrastructure patterns are commoditized. The single miracle here isn't technical. It's distribution. And I don't see any evidence the team has identified that as their core obstacle, let alone organized around solving it. They're focused on product differentiation (filesystem-specific orchestration) in a market where product differentiation is table stakes and distribution determines winners. That's a structural mismatch between where the company is spending its energy and what actually needs to be true for them to succeed.
