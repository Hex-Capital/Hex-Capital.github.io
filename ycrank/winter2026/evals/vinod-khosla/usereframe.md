# Reframe -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Didero raised $37M in February 2026 to build AI agents for manufacturing procurement. Cavela raised $8.6M to automate supplier sourcing with AI. Xometry is public with $643M in revenue running a manufacturing marketplace. And now Reframe enters this space with two founders and YC's standard check. The competitive signal here isn't just a funding gap -- it's an information signal about the category itself. When multiple well-capitalized companies are building variations of the same thing simultaneously, you're not ahead of a curve. You're riding the same wave everyone else already spotted. The experts aren't dismissing this -- they're funding it at scale. That's precisely the wrong signal for me.

Let me start where I always start: if Reframe succeeds completely, what happens? Hardware companies coordinate their overseas supply chains more efficiently. BOMs get updated faster. Supplier emails get automated. Build schedules adapt when parts are delayed. This is genuinely useful. And it is fundamentally a workflow optimization tool. The entire system remains intact -- suppliers, factories, shipping lanes, bills of materials -- the coordination layer just gets faster. Compare that to what I look for: Square didn't optimize how merchants processed credit cards, it made the traditional POS terminal structurally obsolete. Reframe makes procurement emails unnecessary. There is an order-of-magnitude difference in consequence between those two outcomes. I keep asking myself the question I ask every founder: if this works perfectly, does the world operate differently? And the honest answer is no -- procurement teams have a better tool, but the system they operate within is unchanged.

The founders concern me in a specific way. Bryan Zin spent four years as a product design engineer on iPhone at Apple. Eric Wiener built ML systems at DoorDash Labs and Zoox. They are exactly the people you'd cast to build this product -- hardware domain expertise plus AI engineering. And that's the problem. They're insiders applying their accumulated knowledge to automate a pain point they personally experienced. This is the pattern I've seen a hundred times: talented engineers from big companies who build a better version of the workflow they know well. It produces good products and modest businesses. What it doesn't produce is the kind of outsider thinking that creates categories. Nobody told these founders their idea was crazy. Nobody said it was impossible. It's the obvious thing to build given their backgrounds, and the market already agrees -- which is exactly why Didero has $37M.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. Hardware procurement across fragmented overseas supply chains is genuinely painful, and the LLM capability threshold crossed in 2024-2025 makes autonomous agent coordination feasible for the first time. If Reframe executes faster than Didero in a specific vertical -- say, consumer electronics hardware startups in the Bay Area -- they could build deep switching costs. Once your BOM, supplier history, and build schedules live in a platform, migration is costly. The accumulated data on supplier reliability and pricing becomes a compounding asset. And the team's complementary backgrounds are precisely calibrated for this problem. If the founders have a larger vision -- evolving from procurement coordination into a fundamental rethinking of how hardware gets manufactured, perhaps aggregating enough procurement volume to restructure supplier economics entirely -- then the consequence magnitude changes. But nothing in the dossier suggests that ambition. The framing is squarely about making an existing process more efficient, which is the definition of a company that has de-risked its way into territory where success yields a solid business but not a transformed industry.

The technology layer reinforces my concern. LLM-based agents that parse documents, communicate with suppliers, and manage schedules are capabilities that any competent AI team can build with today's foundation models. The architecture is not proprietary. The differentiation is domain focus -- "we specialize in hardware procurement" -- which is a market positioning choice, not a technology moat. When your core technology is broadly available and your competitor has 18x your capital and Microsoft backing through M12, domain focus alone doesn't protect you. The question I ask about technology is whether it creates an economic impact sufficient to displace the established system. Reframe's agents automate the system rather than replacing it. That's the distinction between incremental and disruptive -- and these founders are building the former.

I respect the problem. Supply chain coordination for hardware companies is real, growing, and underserved by incumbent ERP vendors who architected for enterprise scale. But respecting a problem isn't the same as believing it justifies the kind of bet I make. I fund companies where, if the technology works, an entire industry's current approach becomes economically unviable. Reframe's success scenario is a well-run SaaS company capturing a slice of a $35B market. That's a fine outcome for many investors. For me, the consequences of that success are not sufficient to overcome the probability of failure in a space where a directly comparable startup already has $37M and a head start.
