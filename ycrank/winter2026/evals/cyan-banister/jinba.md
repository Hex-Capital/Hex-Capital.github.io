# Jinba -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Jinba: this is an AI workflow automation company entering one of the most crowded, well-funded categories in enterprise software right now. Zapier is doing $310 million in revenue. Workato has $150 million ARR and already launched AI agents. n8n raised $253 million and grew 6x in 2025. When I look at a space like this -- where every investor in the Valley is writing checks, where the incumbents are rich and moving fast -- my instinct is to walk in the other direction. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. "Vibe-coding for workflows" is neither unpopular nor difficult to assess. It's the pitch I'd hear fifteen times at any demo day this year. That's not where I find my best investments.

When I sit down with founders, I don't open with the business. I want to hear the story -- how did you end up here, what happened to you that made this problem impossible to ignore? With Shoya and Takuya, what I see are impressive credentials: a PhD from Keio, deep learning work at Preferred Networks, McKinsey, an INSEAD MBA. That's real capability. But I don't see the biographical thread that connects either founder to enterprise workflow automation specifically. There's no story of watching a parent struggle with broken processes at a factory, no personal encounter with a system that failed someone they loved, no years of obsession that preceded the market opportunity. It reads like two very smart people who identified a large market and built a product to address it. That's a valid way to start a company, but it's not the signal I've learned to trust. The founders who persist through the inevitable crises -- and going up against Zapier and Workato is going to produce plenty of crises -- are usually the ones who are solving something deeply personal.

The bull case deserves real engagement, because if the 40,000 enterprise users at financial institutions claim is legitimate, that changes the calculus significantly. Financial services is brutally hard to sell into. If they genuinely cracked Japanese banks and are now bringing that playbook to the US, that's a real proof point -- not of weirdness, but of execution in one of the most regulated sectors on the planet. The on-prem deployment, the SOC 2 work, the SSO and RBAC and audit logging -- these are the kinds of compliance investments that most pre-seed startups can't stomach, and they create genuine switching costs once embedded. I've always been comfortable with companies that operate in hard, regulated spaces, from IronPort through Anduril and Affirm. If I squint, the Japan-to-US financial services bridge could be a meaningful moat that deters the AI-wrapper startups that flood this category. The Suntory testimonial is a real company with real workflows. But the 40K number is unverified by any third party, and it may belong to the Carnot entity and a different product iteration -- which means it could evaporate in the rebrand and geographic transition rather than compound.

What I don't see -- and this matters deeply to me -- is any mechanism through which Jinba creates economic access or makes invisible systems visible for people who currently lack power. This is enterprise software that makes enterprise workers more efficient. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't create income for someone who had none, it doesn't bring transparency to an opaque system that exploits people, and it doesn't open a door that was previously locked. When I backed Uber, it wasn't primarily a logistics optimization play to me -- it was a poverty-alleviation tool that created income for millions of drivers. When I backed Affirm, it was about replacing hidden credit card fees with transparent interest. Jinba helps enterprise teams automate loan screening and contract review. That's useful, but it doesn't give me the jolt of imagining how the world gets more fair.

The co-founders have been building together since at least 2022 through Carnot, and the complementary skills -- deep ML on one side, enterprise strategy on the other -- are well-matched for this specific problem. That's a positive signal. But I don't know how they fight, how they survived whatever crises Carnot went through, or what happens when the US market doesn't open as fast as they expect and one of them wants to go back to Japan. After HQ Trivia, I always want to understand the fault lines before they appear. Three years of working together is better than three months, but it's not the same as having survived a near-death moment together. Overall, Jinba is a technically capable team in a brutally competitive consensus category, without the biographical urgency or anti-consensus weirdness that drives my best investments.
