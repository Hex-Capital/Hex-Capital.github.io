# Oxus -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first question I ask is always: what do these founders know that I couldn't learn by spending six months reading SOX compliance manuals and shadowing an internal audit team? And here the answer concerns me. Three MIT graduates with backgrounds in investment banking, central bank research, management consulting, and ML engineering. Impressive credentials from impressive institutions. But none of them appear to have been an internal auditor. Janet Liu's Federal Reserve and D.E. Shaw experience is financial regulation exposure, not audit workflow knowledge. Melinda Liu built fintech AI products at JPMorgan -- adjacent, not native. Christine Watts did ML systems engineering and BCG consulting -- technical capability, not domain obsession. This is the profile of smart generalists who identified an underserved market, did their research, and built a product. That's a valid company-building approach, but it's not specific knowledge. Anyone who's spent a few months interviewing chief audit executives would surface the same pain points: manual workpapers, inconsistent documentation, high outsourcing costs. The dossier reads like a well-researched market opportunity, not a founder's lived frustration with a broken system they understand at a cellular level.

The leverage architecture here is incremental efficiency, not a new category of capability. Oxus makes existing auditors faster at producing workpapers, flowcharts, and scoping documents. That's valuable -- but it's the same value proposition as every AI-for-professional-services company. Compare this to what Notion did for productivity or what Replit does for programming: those tools didn't just make existing workers faster, they enabled entirely new people to do entirely new things. Oxus doesn't create a new form of leverage. It optimizes an existing workflow within a single department at companies subject to SOX. There's no network effect -- compliance data is siloed by design, and the company explicitly promises customer data is never reused. Each customer's audit context is bespoke. The product may get better for individual returning customers through institutional knowledge accumulation, but it doesn't get better for all customers as more customers use it. That's linear, not compounding.

The timing story is the opposite of contrarian. AI for compliance is one of the most consensus enterprise AI categories in 2026. Fieldguide has raised $125M at a $700M valuation. AuditBoard, acquired for $3B+, and Workiva, generating $739M in revenue, are both actively adding AI capabilities to their platforms. Denki, another YC company, targets the same problem from a services-replacement angle. The "why now" narrative -- LLMs plus CPA talent shortage -- is the same slide in every pitch deck in this space. Smart people are not dismissing this idea; they're pouring hundreds of millions into it. When everyone agrees the incumbents are slow and the market is ripe for disruption, you're not getting paid for being right first. You're competing on execution in a crowded field where well-capitalized players have a head start. The asymmetric upside that comes from non-consensus positioning simply isn't here.

The strongest bull case: the CPA talent shortage is structural and non-reversible. SOX compliance is legally mandatory. Internal audit teams are a distinct buyer persona that Fieldguide doesn't serve and that AuditBoard serves with pre-AI tools. If Oxus can land enterprise contracts at $100K+ ACV, the narrow initial TAM (~4,000-5,000 SOX-subject companies) supports a real business before any expansion into operational or IT audits. The founders' combination of finance domain knowledge, AI engineering, and consulting experience maps well to the enterprise sales motion this product requires. And Christine Watts's ML systems background means the core product isn't outsourced -- there's a technologist on the founding team. If the AI output quality is genuinely superior to what incumbents bolt on, audit teams that adopt it will create real switching costs around annual audit cycles, templates, and institutional documentation. The regulatory tailwind is as durable as tailwinds get. For this bull case to work, you'd need to believe that the quality gap between AI-native and AI-bolted-on is wide enough to overcome incumbent distribution, and that the founders can develop the deep domain expertise they currently lack while simultaneously building and selling the product. It's plausible but not compelling.

This maps too closely to the pattern I consistently pass on: smart, capable people building "the AI-native version of [incumbent category]" for a specific vertical. The founders are talented but interchangeable with dozens of similarly credentialed teams who could identify the same opportunity. The technology -- LLM-based document analysis and generation -- is accessible to any competent AI team, and Fieldguide is already proving it. The market is real but the timing is consensus, not contrarian. I want to invest in founders who know something that can't be taught, building leverage that didn't previously exist, at a moment when the crowd thinks they're wrong. Oxus has none of these three.
