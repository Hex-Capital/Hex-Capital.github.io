# Vector Legal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I noticed immediately: YC funded at least four AI law firms in the Winter 2026 batch. Four. That tells me everything I need to know about where this sits on the consensus-to-conviction spectrum. When the most prominent accelerator in the world validates a category by funding multiple entrants simultaneously, the weirdness has been completely wrung out. Lawhive just raised $100 million to bring AI legal services to the US. Harvey has over a billion dollars. Spellbook has eighty million. "AI-augmented law firm" is not an insight anymore -- it's a sector thesis with a dozen well-capitalized players executing on it. The most promising companies are not popular, and this category is very, very popular right now.

When I try to hear the founders' stories -- which is always where I start -- I find credentials where I'm looking for scars. Mitch Duncombe has an impressive resume: Berkeley Law, Fenwick & West, three years as YC's in-house counsel. Keenan Venuti went to Harvard, played offensive tackle, worked his way through Adobe and Accenture to a staff AI engineering role at Ironclad. These are accomplished people on established paths. The one detail that piqued my curiosity is that Mitch was apparently a high school math teacher and basketball coach before law school -- that's a non-linear turn that suggests there's more to his story. But the dossier gives me nothing to work with. I don't have the biographical thread that tells me why this person specifically had to build this company, why they couldn't walk away from it. When I backed the Contraline founder, what struck me was years of lonely academic research that everyone else dismissed -- a biographical commitment that preceded and predicted the company. Here, what I see is two capable professionals making a logical career move into a hot category. That's not the signal I invest on.

The strongest bull case deserves honest engagement. Mitch didn't just study startup law -- he lived inside YC for three years watching hundreds of founders struggle with legal complexity in real time. That's embedded knowledge you can't get from a textbook or even from a decade at a law firm. He knows exactly when founders get stuck, what questions they ask at 2 AM before a board vote, which standard documents actually trip people up. Pair that with Keenan, who built production AI systems at Ironclad -- literally the category-defining company in contract lifecycle management -- and you have a team with precise founder-market fit on both the legal and technical dimensions. If they execute well, the YC network gives them a warm-start advantage that could compound: every deal involves two parties, and if both sides use Vector Legal for contract execution and e-signatures, you start building network effects and a data moat. For this to become a great investment, they'd need to capture the YC ecosystem so thoroughly that they become the default legal infrastructure for venture-backed startups, the way Carta became default for cap tables. That's a real possibility -- but it requires winning against batch-mates, well-funded incumbents, and the inevitable BigLaw firms that will adopt AI tools to defend their turf.

The economic access angle is the part of this that speaks to me most, but only partially. Making quality legal counsel available to founders who can't afford $800-an-hour BigLaw attorneys is genuinely valuable. I invested in Affirm because transparent credit access replaced an opaque, predatory system. There's a version of that story here -- legal fees are opaque, founders overpay or go without, and a transparent platform could change that. But the customer base is venture-backed startups, people who already have resources and options. Clerky exists. Stripe Atlas handles incorporation for $500. Solo practitioners serve this market. This isn't creating access for people who had none; it's making an existing service incrementally better for a relatively privileged group. When Uber created income for drivers or Postmates for delivery workers, those were new economic pathways for people who needed them. The magnitude of impact here is different.

What concerns me most is the commoditization risk layered on top of the consensus problem. The underlying technology -- LLM-based contract drafting and review -- is increasingly accessible to anyone. The regulatory requirement of licensed attorneys adds friction, which I normally appreciate as a moat, but every competitor faces the same regulatory environment and several have far more capital to navigate it. Vector Legal's differentiation from Arcline or General Legal isn't clearly established in anything I can see publicly. In a world where three YC companies are pitching nearly identical value propositions to the same customer base, the outcome depends more on execution speed and distribution than on any structural advantage. I'm not the right investor for execution races in consensus categories. I need to feel that jolt of intuitive energy about something nobody else sees yet, and I just don't feel it here.
