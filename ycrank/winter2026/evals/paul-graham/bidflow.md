# Bidflow -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Bidflow is the pivot trail. Six months ago these founders were building QA agents for bug detection -- a developer tools company called Ghostship. Now they're building AI for electrical contractors reading 500-page blueprints. The YC Launch contact email still points to founders@tryghostship.dev. When I see a domain shift this sharp, my first question is always the same: how did they find this problem? Did electrical estimating grow out of something broken in their own lives, or did they sit down after Ghostship stalled and brainstorm "what's a big market with bad software?"

Nothing in the dossier suggests organic discovery. Neither founder has worked in construction, grown up around contractors, or spent time in the estimation workflow before starting the company. The connection to Bass Electric appears to be something they developed after choosing the problem, not the reason they chose it. This is the pattern I've written about in "How to Get Startup Ideas" -- talented people who pick a market rather than discover a need. The problem itself is real, and I'll come back to that. But the path to it matters.

Here's what complicates the picture: electrical estimating is genuinely schlep-heavy. Reading 500-page blueprints, counting thousands of symbols, navigating NECA labor unit standards, pricing materials across volatile supply chains, selling to conservative contractors who've used desktop software for decades. This is ugly, tedious work that most AI founders would unconsciously skip right over. There are hundreds of startups building "AI copilots" for knowledge workers at desks, and almost none building them for electrical estimators reading blueprints on jobsites. The schlep blindness protecting this market is real. Most smart hackers would look at this problem and their unconscious would redirect them toward something cleaner, like yet another coding assistant. The fact that Jesse and Gautham chose this particular schlep over staying in the developer tools world where they're comfortable -- that's not nothing.

The technical signal is the strongest thing here. Jesse Choe is USACO Platinum, top 1% nationally. He interned at Jane Street at 18. Gautham bootstrapped a company to $120K in revenue by age 16 and has three preprints in reinforcement learning. They've built a custom-trained vision model that achieves 83.5% accuracy on electrical symbol recognition -- that's a working system, not a demo. These are genuine hackers who build. I also weigh the co-founder relationship heavily: they met in middle school, have been coding together for over a decade, and have already been through the crucible of a failed company together. That durability matters. When I funded Justin.tv, Emmett and Justin had that kind of history -- they'd already failed once with Kiko, and the fact that they stayed together through failure told me more than any pitch deck.

Three named customers with a testimonial from the owner of Bass Electric claiming 5x faster estimates -- that's a real signal at pre-seed. It's not overwhelming, but it means someone whose livelihood depends on accurate bids trusted this tool enough to let it into their workflow. Electrical contractors don't adopt software casually. The question is whether this pull is genuine enough to survive the grind of selling to a conservative industry, especially against Beam AI with $48M and 1,100+ customers expanding into electrical. The bull case -- and I want to be honest about this -- is that deep vertical specialization beats horizontal breadth in trades like electrical, where NECA labor units, material assemblies, and symbol-specific counting require domain knowledge that generalist tools can't easily replicate. If these founders develop the obsessive customer intimacy that Tony Xu showed delivering food for DoorDash, the initial lack of domain experience could become irrelevant. The data flywheel from customer corrections improving the model is a plausible moat if they can accumulate enough electrical-specific training data before the well-funded competitors decide to go deep.

But I keep returning to the origin question. The best construction tech companies I've seen were started by people who couldn't stop thinking about the problem because they'd lived inside it. Procore was founded by a construction management professional. PlanGrid came from people who'd watched contractors struggle with paper blueprints on job sites. Bidflow came from two competitive programmers who pivoted after their developer tools company didn't work. That's not disqualifying -- ideas can morph, and these founders have the raw ability to learn fast. But it means the motivation has to prove itself. Are they building this because they genuinely care about making electrical estimators' lives better, or because they needed a new idea after the last one died? The answer probably isn't fully formed yet, even in their own minds. That uncertainty, combined with well-funded competitors who could add electrical depth, makes this a wait-and-see rather than a conviction bet from my own money.
