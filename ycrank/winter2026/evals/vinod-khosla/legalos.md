# LegalOS -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most striking thing about LegalOS is that the founders grew up inside the very system they're now "disrupting." Matthew and Rachel Asir were raised in their family's immigration law firm. Matthew already built a predecessor company doing essentially the same thing -- Legal Bullet, founded around 2018, which also promised to cut attorney fees and deliver near-perfect approval rates. Now he's back with better AI tools and a YC badge. This is the antithesis of the outsider founder I look for. When I backed Pat Brown at Impossible Foods, he was a biochemistry professor who didn't know what the food industry considered impossible, which freed him to attempt it. When I backed Peter Beck at Rocket Lab, he was a New Zealander with no aerospace pedigree building orbital launch vehicles. The Asir siblings know exactly what immigration law considers impossible -- which means they know the boundaries. They're optimizing within them, not breaking through them.

Let me start where I always start: if LegalOS succeeds completely, what changes? Visa applications get processed in 48 hours instead of weeks. Employers pay less for immigration legal services. The approval rate stays high. And then what? USCIS still adjudicates the same way. The visa categories remain the same. The cap still exists. The entire system operates identically -- just the intermediary layer got more efficient. The global visa services market is $3 billion today, projected to $10 billion by 2033. Even capturing a dominant share of U.S. employment-based immigration legal services means building a mid-nine-figure revenue business in the best case. That's a fine business. It's not a consequence that justifies the kind of risk I'm calibrated for. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. They've scoped the problem to a size where success is achievable and inconsequential in the same breath.

The technology assessment reinforces this concern. The 12,000-petition training dataset is real -- and it's the most defensible thing here. But the core capability is drafting structured legal narratives using foundation models that GPT-4, Claude, and every competitor can access. Alma has a nearly identical positioning with a year head start and $5.1 million in seed funding. Casium spun out of AI2 with ML research depth. Deel bolted Legalpad onto a $12 billion global HR platform with massive employer distribution. The AI drafting capability is table stakes, not a moat. What LegalOS has is domain data and family relationships -- advantages that create a competent business, not a category-defining one. The structural insight that incumbent law firms can't adopt AI without cannibalizing their billable-hour revenue is real, but it applies equally to every AI immigration startup in the space. It's a market observation, not a company-specific advantage.

The strongest bull case I can construct is this: vertical integration as the law firm itself, not a software vendor, could create a data flywheel -- every filed petition improves the model, better models attract more cases, more cases generate more data. If LegalOS achieves significantly higher approval rates and lower costs than competitors, employers would consolidate immigration work with them. The incumbent law firms (Fragomen, BAL) genuinely cannot respond because their economic model depends on the inefficiency being eliminated. And the team's founder-market fit is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed -- lifetime immersion in the problem, a prior company in the exact space, and a CTO who built LLM safety pipelines at TikTok and document classification at Notarize. If I believed the consequence of dominating U.S. immigration legal services was large enough to matter, this team would be my pick to do it. But the ceiling constrains my enthusiasm more than the execution risk. A winner in this market is a strong law firm, not a company that changes how the world works.

The timing is fine but not early. LLMs crossing the quality threshold for legal drafting happened in 2023-2024 -- two years ago. Multiple funded competitors already exist. This isn't skating to where the puck will be; the puck arrived and several players are already fighting over it. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was "laughable" and no other major VC was writing checks. When I entered food tech in 2010, delivery platforms were a curiosity. LegalOS entered AI immigration in 2024, after Alma, after Casium, after Deel acquired Legalpad. The exponential curve in LLM capability is real, but the application of that curve to immigration petitions is already consensus. I don't get option-value learning from a category others have already defined.

I pass. These founders are too smart and too capable to spend their careers making visa applications 60% cheaper in a single-digit-billion-dollar market surrounded by well-funded competitors doing the same thing. The problem they've chosen is important to the people it affects but modest in consequence at the system level. If Matthew Asir brought me a thesis on using AI to fundamentally restructure how immigration systems operate globally -- not just draft petitions faster within the existing U.S. framework -- I'd lean forward. The ambition needs to match the talent.
