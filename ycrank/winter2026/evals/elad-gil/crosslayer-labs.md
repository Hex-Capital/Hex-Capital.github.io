# Crosslayer Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most striking thing about Crosslayer Labs is something I almost never see at pre-seed: the founding team authored a globally mandated internet standard. CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC-067, which requires MPIC for every HTTPS certificate issued anywhere in the world, was unanimously approved in August 2024 and enters enforcement September 2025. Henry Birge-Lee coded the first implementation in 2016, led the seminal USENIX paper in 2018, and co-authored the ballot itself. This isn't a team that studied a regulatory landscape and found an angle -- they built the regulatory infrastructure. That's a pattern I've seen work in my own portfolio: regulatory complexity deters most software-focused investors, which means the companies that can operate inside it face structurally less competition. When I backed Coinbase, most investors couldn't evaluate financial regulation. When I led Anduril's D round, most investors couldn't evaluate ITAR. Here, the barrier is even more extreme -- you'd need a decade of published research at USENIX Security and ACM CCS plus working relationships with Google, Apple, Let's Encrypt, and Sectigo to credibly compete. That knowledge moat is real.

The structural moment is concrete and timestamped, which is what I look for. The MPIC mandate created industry-wide awareness that BGP-based impersonation attacks are a validated threat class, not a theoretical concern. Before August 2024, cross-layer infrastructure security monitoring was an academic topic. After the mandate, every certificate authority and every enterprise that depends on HTTPS certificates knows these attacks are real enough to warrant a global standard. But -- and this is important -- the mandate only secures certificate issuance at a point in time. Ongoing monitoring of DNS, BGP, TLS, and JavaScript dependencies for impersonation attacks is a separate problem the mandate doesn't solve. Crosslayer is positioned in that gap: the regulation validates the threat model without closing the commercial opportunity. That's structurally similar to how GDPR created the compliance monitoring market without solving compliance itself.

Where I get less certain is on the market ceiling and the product-to-distribution trajectory. Attack surface management is a $1-1.5 billion market today, growing at 20-30% CAGR. Cross-layer impersonation detection is a subset of that. The question is whether this stays a specialized point solution or becomes a wedge into something larger. PagerDuty started with narrow alerting and became the operations infrastructure layer for every company running software -- the "too boring" pattern in its purest form. Crosslayer's "outside-in" monitoring position gives them visibility into a customer's full internet-facing infrastructure, which could be that kind of expansion surface. But I don't see evidence the founders are thinking about distribution beyond demo-driven enterprise sales and their CA relationships. At pre-seed I give the benefit of the doubt when market structure allows for platform expansion, but I want to see distribution thinking, not just product thinking.

The single-miracle framework works unusually well here. The technical miracle -- proving that cross-layer attacks are real and building detection for them -- is already delivered. A decade of research, production-used open-source implementations, a global standard, and an IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize have retired the technology risk. The remaining miracle is commercial execution: can three Princeton researchers build an enterprise SaaS business with sales, customer success, and go-to-market? That's a clear, singular obstacle. YC helps, and the CA/Browser Forum relationships provide initial enterprise access. But none of the three founders have prior startup experience or commercial exits. Prateek Mittal, the Chief Scientist, is a tenured professor with an active research lab -- his operational availability is uncertain. The academic-to-commercial transition has broken plenty of technically brilliant teams.

The bull case that would make this a great investment: if the MPIC mandate is the leading edge of a broader regulatory wave around internet infrastructure security, Crosslayer becomes the category-defining company in cross-layer monitoring -- the way Coinbase became the category-defining company in crypto infrastructure during the early regulatory wave. The team's relationships with CAs become the distribution channel, the monitoring platform becomes sticky infrastructure, and the $1B ASM market turns out to be a floor rather than a ceiling because enterprise awareness of infrastructure-layer attacks is still in the early adoption phase. If enterprises start treating cross-layer impersonation monitoring the way they now treat endpoint detection -- as table stakes -- this is a $5B+ category and Crosslayer has a structural head start that incumbents can't replicate quickly. That scenario is plausible but requires the market to expand beyond the current niche, and I don't yet see the evidence that enterprise demand is pulling for this specific product category rather than the team pushing it.

The technology cycle positioning is strong -- the team spent a decade doing foundational work and is converting to commercial at exactly the moment their regulatory mandate creates the market. But strong timing on a narrow market is different from strong timing on a large market. I'm watching this one. If they demonstrate enterprise pull in the next 6-12 months -- actual paying customers, not just CA relationships -- the conviction math changes significantly.
