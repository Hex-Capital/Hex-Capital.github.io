# Kita -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Document processing for Philippine lenders is exactly the kind of company that triggers a dismissive reaction from most investors I talk to. "Too niche, too geographically constrained, too operationally messy." That reaction is the signal I pay attention to. When I look at my best-performing investments -- PagerDuty in operations alerting, Checkr in background checks, Gusto in payroll -- they all shared this quality of sounding boring and small at the exact moment the adoption curve was inflecting underneath them. Kita sits in that archetype: "boring but critical" infrastructure for a market that's quietly undergoing a structural transformation.

The structural moment here is specific and trackable, which is what I need to see. Over 60% of Philippine transactions now flow through e-wallets, up dramatically from near-zero five years ago. That adoption curve has created an entirely new corpus of digital financial documents -- e-wallet records, digital bank statements, mobile payment histories -- that didn't exist in processable form before. Meanwhile, roughly half the population remains traditionally unbanked, meaning lenders can't rely on credit bureau data or banking APIs. So you have surging digital financial activity generating documents that lenders need to underwrite against, but no infrastructure to extract structured signals from those documents. The VLM capability threshold crossing in 2023-2024 is the enabling technology that makes automated extraction from noisy, non-standardized emerging market documents feasible for the first time. Two years ago, legacy OCR broke on these files. Today, vision-language models can handle them. That's a genuine "why now" -- not "AI exists" but "this specific capability crossed this specific threshold in a market that was simultaneously generating the documents that need processing."

The execution velocity is what separates this from a thesis exercise. A six-figure paid pilot secured at prototype stage, expansion to multiple Southeast Asian markets, and approximately 30% month-over-month growth -- from a two-person team at pre-seed. When lenders are pulling an unfinished product out of the founders' hands and paying six figures for it, that tells me the pain point is acute and the existing alternatives (manual review, broken OCR) are genuinely inadequate. Carmel Limcaoco being from Manila isn't incidental here -- it's the founder-market fit that makes enterprise sales in the Philippines tractable rather than impossible. The CTO Rhea Malhotra winning Stanford's Firestone Medal for best CS thesis with research directly in computer vision gives me confidence the technical foundation isn't shallow.

The product-to-distribution path is where I see real upside potential, though it's early. Kita's architecture links document-level extraction signals to downstream loan repayment outcomes, creating a feedback loop that improves fraud detection and risk assessment over time. If that loop works, Kita evolves from a document processing tool into an underwriting intelligence layer -- and from there, the expansion into credit scoring, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring becomes a natural distribution play through the same lender integration. That's the Stripe pattern at a smaller scale: start with one wedge (document extraction), build a relationship with every lender in the market, then distribute additional products through that relationship. The hyperlocalization effort -- building market-specific models for the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico -- also creates compounding switching costs that a generalist IDP provider can't easily replicate.

My main concern is commoditization. VLMs are improving rapidly, and in principle, a well-funded competitor or a general-purpose AI platform could build document extraction for emerging-market lending documents. The defensibility depends entirely on the pace at which Kita accumulates proprietary training data tied to lending outcomes and builds deep lender integrations across multiple markets. If the feedback loop generates real predictive lift on loan default rates -- connecting document signals to repayment in ways that generic extraction cannot -- then the moat deepens with each lender onboarded. If the extraction alone is the value proposition, that's a feature, not a company. I also see a potential second miracle lurking: enterprise sales cycles to lending institutions in emerging markets, across multiple regulatory regimes, with a two-person team. Carmel's Manila roots help in the Philippines, but Indonesia, Mexico, and other target markets each require separate distribution efforts. That said, the existing traction suggests the first miracle -- model accuracy on noisy emerging market documents -- is already partially delivered, and the sales cycle appears shorter than I'd typically expect for lending infrastructure, likely because the pain is severe enough that lenders are motivated buyers.

This is a "boring but critical" infrastructure play in a non-obvious market at a structural inflection point, built by founders with the right technical depth and local market access. The emerging market angle adds regulatory complexity that most investors avoid -- which is precisely what creates the structural moat if Kita executes. The company doesn't need to build its own foundation models; it needs to build the localized, lending-specific intelligence layer on top of improving VLMs, which is the right side of the value chain to occupy during a technology wave. I'd invest, with the caveat that the next twelve months will reveal whether the lending-outcome feedback loop generates durable differentiation or whether this is a commoditizable extraction layer.
