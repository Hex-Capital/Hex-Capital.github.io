# Cascade -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Cascade: this is one of the most consensus categories in all of venture right now. AI safety, guardrails, agent reliability -- Gartner is writing reports about it, Meta is open-sourcing tools for it, WitnessAI has $58 million, Fiddler has raised around $100 million, and F5 paid $180 million to acquire CalypsoAI. Every investor in the Valley thinks agentic AI safety is important and investable. And that's the problem for me. My entire framework is built around finding the companies that are not popular, that are difficult to assess, that make other investors squirm. When I backed SpaceX, people thought private space was lunacy. When I invested in Crusoe, nobody understood why you'd mine Bitcoin on stranded gas. Those deals were available to me precisely because they repelled consensus thinking. Cascade is building in a space that attracts consensus capital like a magnet. The opportunity for an outsized return on conviction doesn't exist here -- you're competing on execution speed against teams with ten to fifty times your funding, and the category is well-understood enough that incumbents are already moving in.

If I were sitting across from Adam and Haluk, my first question would be the same one I always ask: tell me your story, not the business. And what I can see from the dossier gives me strong academic credentials -- UC Berkeley CS, Berkeley AI Research Lab, Adam's work with Dawn Song who is genuinely one of the most respected names in AI security, Haluk's production monitoring experience at Netflix and Amazon. These are smart, well-trained people. But I'm not finding the biographical thread that tells me why these two are the ones who must solve this specific problem. Where's the hardship that forged the commitment? Where's the lived experience that makes this personal rather than professional? Building AI safety infrastructure because you came out of a top AI research lab and this is the obvious next step -- that's a career move, not a calling. I've learned to distinguish between founders who are solving a problem that emerged from their own struggle and founders who identified an attractive market and applied their skills to it. The former survive the inevitable crisis. The latter often pivot when things get hard.

The strongest bull case for Cascade is this: if agentic AI adoption explodes on the timeline Gartner predicts -- 40% of enterprise applications featuring AI agents by end of 2026 -- then someone will capture the safety infrastructure layer, and Cascade's technical foundations are genuinely relevant. Dawn Song's research lineage in AI security is not something you can fake. Haluk building production monitoring at Netflix-scale systems is directly applicable to building reliability infrastructure. The "self-improving models" framing, if it's real and not just positioning language, could create a compounding data advantage as they observe more agent failures across customer deployments. And the YC backing with Diana Hu as partner gives them a path to early enterprise design partners. If they can get embedded in agent deployment pipelines before CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks retool their architectures, switching costs could protect them. But this is a timing-and-execution thesis, not a conviction thesis. It requires being faster than well-funded competitors in a well-understood market. That's a legitimate bet -- it's just not my bet.

What I don't see here is any signal that this company makes an invisible system visible for people who need it, or creates economic access for underserved populations. This is enterprise B2B infrastructure sold to companies deploying AI agents. Important work, sure. But Uber created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers. Affirm gave transparent credit to people locked out of the system. Thumbtack connected skilled tradespeople with customers. Cascade secures enterprise AI workflows. The impact is real but it's an abstraction-layer removed from the people I think about when I invest. There's also the practical concern of brand disambiguation -- "Cascade" is shared by so many companies that they're operating from runcascade.com, and their own website was returning only CSS framework code at the time of research. That doesn't give me confidence in the obsessive building energy I look for.

Both founders came through Berkeley's AI research ecosystem together, which gives them a shared technical vocabulary and likely a strong working relationship. But I don't have any evidence about how they handle disagreement, how they've been stress-tested, or how long they've actually worked closely together before starting this company. After HQ Trivia taught me that even the best timing and the best product can't survive a co-founder fracture, I probe these dynamics hard. A shared research lab background is a starting point, not proof of resilience. At two people with no traction signals visible -- no revenue, no public user counts, no press, zero open job postings -- I'd want to understand what they've actually shipped together and how they navigated the inevitable friction points that come with going from academic research to company building.

I respect the technical credentials here, and I think the agentic AI safety market will produce meaningful companies. But everything about Cascade's positioning runs counter to how I invest. This is a popular category, the founders are building from academic pedigree rather than personal necessity, the competition is well-funded and growing, and the potential for platform providers to commoditize the safety layer is real. For someone who invests through consensus frameworks and execution-speed analysis, this might score differently. For me, the signal I trust most -- that feeling of discovering something weird and dismissed that nobody else sees -- is absent.
