# Velum Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing that struck me about Velum is the gap between what a two-person team claims and what's plausible at this stage. The website lists 50+ enterprise integrations -- SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, ServiceNow -- and SOC 2 Type II certification. For context, SOC 2 Type II requires demonstrating sustained security controls over a monitoring period, and each enterprise integration typically involves weeks of engineering work against proprietary APIs, schema migrations, and edge cases. When I was building Color, I learned that a single CLIA-certified lab integration required months. The overclaiming doesn't just raise credibility questions -- it signals that the team may not yet understand what enterprise buyers actually need to trust a vendor handling their most sensitive data. Enterprise security is a domain where credibility is the product, and claims that don't survive scrutiny destroy it.

The structural moment for AI data security is real -- I'll give them that. RAG architectures pulling enterprise data into LLM contexts, AI agents making API calls across internal systems, copilots ingesting documents for summarization -- these create genuinely new data exposure surfaces that traditional DLP wasn't built for. The regulatory pressure is intensifying too: GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA all apply to AI-mediated data processing, and most enterprises haven't figured out compliance yet. But here's the problem -- this is no longer a non-obvious market. It's consensus. Noma Security has $132 million in funding and reports 1,300% year-over-year ARR growth. Check Point acquired Lakera. Veeam acquired Securiti. When incumbents are running acqui-hires in your category and a startup with 100x your capital is posting quadruple-digit growth rates, you're not entering a market at an inflection point -- you're entering a market where the inflection point already happened and the winners are consolidating. The acqui-hires removed standalone competitors, but they brought the distribution power of billion-dollar platforms into the space. That's the opposite of a structural opening.

The product positioning itself concerns me. The website frames Velum as "the ontology engine for enterprise AI." The YC page calls it "an open-source firewall for content-level access control." The blog says "Dynamic Data Firewall for your Unstructured Data." These aren't different words for the same thing -- they're different products for different buyers. An ontology engine is infrastructure for data modeling teams. A firewall is a security product for CISOs. A data layer for unstructured data is middleware for data engineers. When I invest in pre-seed companies, I expect the product to still be evolving, but I need the founders to have identified the single buyer persona they're obsessed with serving. Product positioning ambiguity at this stage usually means the team hasn't found their customer yet, and that compounds the multi-miracle concern: build a semantic understanding layer, get it to work across heterogeneous enterprise systems, earn CISO trust, build open-source community traction, and land enterprise contracts. That's at least four sequential breakthroughs.

The strongest bull case would go like this: content-level access control is actually a distinct category from broader AI security governance, and the removal of Lakera and Securiti as standalone players creates a structural gap for a focused, open-source alternative. If Velum's ontology-based approach genuinely creates more expressive and accurate policy enforcement than pattern-matching PII detection, the switching costs from encoded enterprise policies could be substantial. The open-source wedge could work the way it did for HashiCorp or Snyk -- developer adoption bottoms up, then enterprise sales on top. And the TAM projections ($3.2 billion by 2033 for AI firewalls alone) might understate the real opportunity if you account for all enterprise data flows, not just LLM-adjacent ones. For this to work, though, you'd need to see evidence of a shipped product gaining organic developer adoption, a clear choice of buyer persona, and a distribution strategy more concrete than "we're open source." None of that evidence exists in the dossier.

Alen's technical background is the strongest signal here -- CalHacks overall winner, principal engineer at a managed ML platform, deep learning research across multiple institutions, and a pinned GitHub repo called "ontology" that's directly relevant to the product architecture. That's a real technical builder. But the CTO's technical depth alone doesn't address the company's core challenge: this is an enterprise security sale to CISOs at regulated organizations, and neither founder appears to have enterprise security domain experience or the kind of network that opens doors at Fortune 500 security teams. The core capabilities they're building -- NLP-based sensitive data detection, policy-based redaction, tokenization -- are individually available through commodity ML models and existing PII detection libraries. The differentiation has to come from the integration layer and the ontology engine, which is real engineering work but not a defensible technical moat at this funding level against competitors with two orders of magnitude more capital.

I'm passing. The market is real but consensus, the competitive landscape has already consolidated significantly, the product positioning hasn't crystallized, and the company's claims outpace what a two-person pre-seed team can credibly deliver. Content-level access control for AI workflows might be a feature of the winning AI security platform rather than a standalone category -- and if Noma or the acquirers build it as a feature, Velum's entire surface area gets absorbed.
