# Cajal -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what I notice first: I already wrote a check to Theorem last year — $6M seed, Khosla Ventures led it — for formal verification applied to AI-generated code. So I've been inside the formal verification thesis. And the thing I learned from that bet is how brutally competitive this space has become in twelve months. Harmonic AI sits at $1.45 billion valuation with $295 million raised. Axiom Math at $300 million with $164 million. Google DeepMind's AlphaProof is publishing results. DeepSeek is releasing open-source Lean4 provers. This is no longer a category that hasn't been opened to venture capital — it's a category where the capital has already arrived in overwhelming force. When I backed Juniper against Cisco, Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing in public telecom would never happen. The incumbents dismissed it. Here, the well-capitalized competitors are building the exact same thing — AI systems that generate formally verified proofs in Lean. The experts aren't dismissing this; they're pouring hundreds of millions into it. That's the wrong signal for me.

The consequence-of-success question is where Cajal struggles most under my framework. If Cajal fully succeeds — if their multi-agent system Tau can autonomously discover and formally verify novel mathematical results in quantum computing, finance, and cryptography — what changes? Scientific papers become more rigorous. Certain proofs get generated faster. Critical systems get stronger correctness guarantees. These are valuable outcomes, but they are additive improvements to existing workflows, not replacements of them. Formal verification doesn't make simulation obsolete or informal reasoning economically unviable — it layers guarantees on top. Compare this to Square, which didn't just improve payment processing; it made the entire traditional POS infrastructure irrelevant for millions of merchants. Or Impossible Foods, which aimed to make animal agriculture unnecessary, not incrementally better. The stated TAM — a $1.12 billion formal verification copilot market — tells the story. This is a well-defined niche, not a trillion-dollar system ripe for structural disruption. Even granting the most expansive vision — that AI-verified formal proofs transform all of science and engineering — the path from "verified training corpora and RL environments" to that outcome requires multiple leaps I can't trace.

The bull case deserves honest engagement. It goes like this: formal verification is where the internet was in 1993 — technically possible, practically unusable, waiting for the right interface to unlock mass adoption. If Cajal builds the abstraction layer that makes formal proof generation as accessible as running a unit test, every engineer and scientist becomes a user. The $103 billion broader software verification market becomes addressable. The founders' ML backgrounds — outsiders to formal methods — might be exactly right because the bottleneck isn't proving theorems, it's making proof generation an ML problem. And the timing is perfect: Lean 4 just matured, LLMs just crossed the formal reasoning threshold, and the big players (Harmonic, Axiom) are chasing math olympiad glory rather than building practical tools for applied domains. If Cajal captures the applied-science wedge while competitors pursue prestige, they could own a critical niche. I take this seriously. But three things prevent me from acting on it: the consequence magnitude even in this bull case is "important software company," not "the world operates differently"; the founders have no documented connection to formal verification, Lean, or theorem proving — no publications, no open-source contributions, no evidence they've built anything in this domain; and the competitive moat against a Harmonic pivot into applied domains is nonexistent at this stage.

The founder profile gives me pause in a specific way. I love outsiders — Peter Beck building rockets from New Zealand, Pat Brown bringing biochemistry to hamburgers. But those outsiders brought deep expertise in the underlying science of their approach. Beck had been engineering propulsion systems since he was a teenager. Brown was one of the world's leading biochemists. The outsider advantage works when you have mastery of the fundamental capability and ignorance of the industry's conventional limitations. Here, neither founder has publicly demonstrated mastery of formal methods, type theory, or the Lean ecosystem — the fundamental capability their product requires. Luke Johnston's background is ML and neuroscience. Pedro Nobre's is computer vision and a prior startup in a different domain. Their GitHub presence is minimal. They met at Entrepreneurs First, a founder-matching program, which tells me this company was assembled around an opportunity rather than born from a founder who couldn't stop thinking about a problem. That's a meaningful difference. When I invested in Impossible Foods, Pat Brown had spent years obsessing over the environmental catastrophe of animal agriculture before I ever met him. The problem chose him. Here, the problem appears to have been selected.

The timing trajectory is the one dimension where Cajal scores well by my framework. The convergence of Lean 4 maturity and LLM formal reasoning capability is real — AlphaProof's IMO results, Harmonic's gold medal, the $10M in new Lean ecosystem funding all confirm an exponential curve. But strong timing alone has never been sufficient for me. The technology curve being right means every well-capitalized player sees the same opportunity. Cajal is skating to where the puck will be, but so are teams with a hundred times more capital and deeper technical benches. I pass.
