# 10x Science -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that jumps out about 10x Science is the specificity of the founder-problem connection. David Roberts didn't read about protein characterization in a market report. He has a PhD in analytical chemistry, 50+ publications, and two patents in this exact domain. He's been sitting in Carolyn Bertozzi's Nobel Prize-winning lab at Stanford doing mass spectrometry by hand, using BioPharma Finder and UNIFI, fighting with instrument-locked legacy software that was designed before transformer models existed. Andrew Reiter built proteomics methods at the Broad Institute — one of the premier mass spectrometry facilities on the planet. These two have been living inside the broken workflow they want to fix. That's not "we brainstormed what AI could be applied to." That's years of accumulated frustration with tools that weren't built for the throughput that AI-designed drug candidates now demand.

The schlep here is real and multi-layered, which is the part that interests me most. Mass spectrometry data analysis for biopharma isn't just a software problem. You need to understand fragmentation patterns, post-translational modifications, glycosylation variants, and then wrap all of that in GxP-compliant validated workflows that the FDA will accept. The dossier correctly identifies that "two talent pools rarely overlap" — proteomics domain experts and AI/ML engineers. That's schlep blindness working in the founders' favor. Most AI teams look at this problem and unconsciously filter it out because they'd need five years of chemistry training to even understand the data. Most mass spectrometry scientists don't build AI systems. Roberts and Reiter already climbed the knowledge barrier; Vishnu Tejus — who scaled Nooks from founding through a $43M Series B — brings the engineering and startup execution side. That's a well-constructed team for a problem that structurally deters entry from either direction alone.

The instrument-agnostic angle is also a classic structural play. Thermo Fisher and Waters bundle their analysis software with their mass spectrometers. Building a best-in-class standalone platform that works across instrument vendors would cannibalize their bundling strategy — which means they're incentivized not to do it. This is the kind of misaligned-incumbent dynamic that creates genuine openings for startups. It's not quite Stripe-level (where banks were structurally incapable of building developer APIs), but it rhymes. The annoying, tedious work of supporting multiple vendor data formats is exactly the kind of unsexy complexity that keeps competitors away.

Where I get stuck is that I have no evidence anyone is actually pulling this product toward them. No revenue, no LOIs, no prototype users, no academic lab giving feedback, no waitlist. At pre-seed I don't demand much — but I want something. When Airbnb's founders were at our stage, they at least had hosts who needed rental income to pay their rent. When Drew Houston applied, he had a working prototype and a demo video that generated genuine excitement. Here, 415 LinkedIn followers is the strongest public signal, and that tells me very little. Biopharma sales cycles are notoriously slow, and getting a new analytical tool validated for GxP submissions could take years. The "why now" story is intellectually compelling — AI-designed proteins flooding the pipeline create demand-side pressure — but I haven't seen evidence that any specific biopharma team is feeling that pressure acutely enough to try a startup's tool over their validated incumbent workflow.

There's also a timing question I can't fully resolve. The company was founded in 2025, right in the middle of the AI boom. Were Roberts and Reiter frustrated with peptide mapping software for years before deciding to build something? Or did they look at the AI wave and think "we should start a company applying AI to our field"? Given their depth of immersion — years of daily use of exactly these tools — I suspect the frustration is genuine and the AI capability advancement is what made the solution newly feasible. That's a legitimate "why now," not a manufactured one. But I'd want to hear the founders describe the specific moment when they decided the existing tools were intolerable. The difference between "I've been annoyed by this for five years and now I can finally fix it" and "AI is transforming everything, let's transform our field too" is the difference between organic discovery and market-driven ideation.

If this works, it's a genuine picks-and-shovels play for the entire AI-driven drug discovery wave. Every AI-designed protein therapeutic needs characterization before clinical trials. If 10x Science becomes the default analysis platform — instrument-agnostic, AI-native, faster and more accurate than BioPharma Finder — it could be infrastructure that the entire biopharma industry runs on. The domain moat is deep, the incumbents are structurally disadvantaged, and the market is growing because of forces outside the company's control (AI accelerating the front end of drug development). That's a compelling setup. But setup without user evidence is still just a thesis, and at this stage I don't have enough signal to distinguish between "this will be transformative" and "this is a smart team that will struggle to sell into conservative biopharma quality labs for three years."

One small concern: the "2x YC Founder" claim on the YC page doesn't match public records showing Tejus as "Founding Software Engineer" at Nooks rather than co-founder. This might be nothing — titles at early-stage companies are fluid — but I notice when founders optimize their credentials for fundraising rather than accuracy. It's a minor flag, not a dealbreaker.
