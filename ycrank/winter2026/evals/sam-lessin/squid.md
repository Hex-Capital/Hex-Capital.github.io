# Squid -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out about Squid is that National Grid DSO -- one of the largest distribution system operators on the planet -- launched a public-facing FlexPortal built on top of a pre-seed company's technology. That's not a pilot buried in some innovation lab. That's a head of flexibility markets going on record saying "for too long flex data lived in spreadsheets, not anymore." For a two-person company that hasn't publicly launched pricing yet, getting a major grid operator to ship your platform as their customer-facing flexibility tool is a genuinely unusual signal. It suggests the founders aren't selling a vision -- they already built something a sophisticated buyer needed badly enough to deploy.

The founder calibration here is interesting but ultimately skews "sane person, sane idea" rather than the pairing I look for. George Kolokotronis checks every box on the credibility side -- Cambridge MPhil in Engineering, Head of Technology at Octopus Energy, AWS AI/Data experience, and he's already done this once with VoltQuant, a grid intelligence startup that had National Grid as a customer. Conor Jones adds BCG rigor and direct National Grid operational experience. These are deeply domain-credible people who lived inside the organizations they're now selling to. That's the "sane" part, and it's strong. But here's my problem: building better grid planning software is not an insane idea right now. Neara just closed a $90M Series D at a $1.1B valuation. The DOE is running AI challenges specifically for grid planning. Camus has $29M. Envelio got acquired by E.ON. Every climate-focused VC in the market understands that legacy grid tools are ancient desktop applications and the energy transition demands modern planning infrastructure. When an idea has a unicorn competitor, government backing, and trade press coverage, the non-consensus premium has been competed away. I'm buying at market price.

The structural moat question is where my framework gets most uncomfortable. Squid is tagged "SaaS" on its own YC page. It's browser-native collaborative software. This is the exact category I've been saying publicly gets destroyed as AI commoditizes software development. Now, the counterargument is that grid planning software requires deep domain knowledge -- power systems physics, utility data formats, regulatory specifics across jurisdictions -- and that knowledge barrier is real. SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications take time and money. But domain knowledge is learnable, certifications are achievable, and $166M in Neara's bank account can buy a lot of power systems engineers. The potential moat here isn't the software -- it's the data accumulation. If utilities adopt Squid as their single "network model of record" and build years of version history, assumptions, and institutional knowledge into the platform, switching costs compound. That's genuinely defensible. But that's an if, not a today.

The bull case I have to honestly engage with: the concept of a canonical, versioned network model that becomes the shared truth layer for all grid planning, flexibility markets, and infrastructure investment decisions is structurally closer to a new primitive than a SaaS application. If every stakeholder in a grid ecosystem -- the DSO, the flexibility providers, the connection applicants, the asset managers -- all reference the same Squid model, then Squid isn't a tool, it's a standard. The FlexPortal launch is a baby version of this dynamic -- National Grid built a public product on Squid's model layer, which means third parties are now consuming Squid's data representation. That's the beginning of protocol behavior. If the network model of record becomes the shared abstraction layer for the entire energy transition, the narrative expands from "grid planning tool" to "operating system for the decarbonized grid" -- and that's genuinely an infinity story backed by a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure transformation. The founders have the domain background to credibly pursue this, and the timing is right as grid planning cycles compress from years to months under electrification pressure.

But I keep returning to the structural concern: even if I buy the primitive aspiration, today this is enterprise SaaS sold to utilities with 12-month-plus procurement cycles, no public revenue, and "Coming Soon" pricing at $0. The company doesn't yet have the revenue cushion that makes me comfortable at any stage. The competitive landscape is funded and moving. And the AI capabilities Squid uses to accelerate planning workflows are exactly the capabilities that get cheaper and more widely available with every foundation model improvement -- meaning the "AI-powered grid planning" positioning cuts against them over time as incumbents integrate the same capabilities. Would this business be compelling if AI didn't exist? Actually, probably yes -- the collaborative, browser-native, single-source-of-truth value proposition solves a real workflow problem independent of AI. That passes my "cherry on top" test. But the market consensus around it means I'm not getting the non-consensus discount that makes seed investing worthwhile.

Strong founders in a real and growing market, with an impressive early deployment signal. But it's SaaS, the market is hot, the idea is becoming obvious, and the moat is aspirational rather than structural today. I respect the execution but this isn't my kind of bet.
