# Fort -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Fort: this is an extremely well-credentialed team building a product in a category that is already trending hard. WHOOP's own data shows strength workouts on their platform grew 122% year-over-year. Oura calls strength training the third most popular activity among women on their platform. Peter Attia and the longevity movement have made resistance training culturally mandatory for a certain demographic. When I look at Fort, I see three talented Tesla engineers riding a wave — and that's precisely the kind of opportunity I tend to walk past. The most promising companies I've backed were not popular and were difficult to assess. Fort is neither. Any investor can look at the strength training trend, look at the gap in wearable capabilities, and see the opportunity. That's consensus forming in real time.

When I sit down with founders, I don't want to hear about the business first. I want to hear about how they got to where they are — the specific hardship, the biographical thread that makes them the only person who could solve this problem. Miranda's connection to Fort is that she works out and her WHOOP doesn't track her lifts well enough. Paul worked on sensing systems at Tesla. Zac designed spacecraft structures at SpaceX. These are impressive resumes, genuinely — the kind of hardware engineering pedigree that makes other investors comfortable writing checks. But I'm not hearing a survival story. I'm not hearing about the thing that broke them or remade them or kept them awake at three in the morning for reasons that go deeper than product-market fit. Consumer frustration is valid motivation, but it's not the same as the biographical commitment I saw in the Contraline founder who spent years in academic obscurity working on male contraception because nobody else would, or in the Crusoe team who independently discovered that wasted gas could become computation because they'd been obsessing over energy waste for most of their careers. Fort's founders are smart and capable, but the thread connecting their lives to this specific problem is thin.

I want to be fair to the bull case, because there is one. Consumer hardware is genuinely hard — it kills most startups — and this team has actually shipped physical products at Tesla-scale manufacturing. Paul's work on cabin radar sensing systems for the Semi maps directly to the sensor fusion problem at Fort's core. The multi-mount form factor, where the band magnetically attaches to equipment or body straps to capture movements wrist-only devices miss, is a legitimately novel design choice that could unlock better training data than anything on the market. If they nail the auto-detection algorithms and build a proprietary dataset of exercise kinematics paired with biometric signals, that data flywheel could create real switching costs. And the timing argument is real — strength training is underserved by wearables in a way that cardio and sleep no longer are. If I were a different kind of investor, one who indexes on team credentials and market timing and hardware execution capability, I might lean in. A16z or someone who backs credentialed teams into obvious gaps would love this.

But I'm not that investor. What I uniquely notice is what Fort doesn't do: it doesn't create economic access for anyone. It's a $349 device for people who already have gym memberships, already own wearables, and already have the resources to optimize their fitness. Compare that to what drew me to Uber — I didn't see a logistics company, I saw a way for regular people to earn income with their own cars. Or Affirm — transparent credit for people who'd been exploited by hidden fees. Or Thumbtack — connecting skilled tradespeople to customers. Fort doesn't make an invisible system visible or open a door that was closed. It makes an already-privileged activity slightly more measurable. That's a product improvement, not a structural shift, and structural shifts are what I fund.

The competitive dynamics also concern me in a way that goes beyond the standard "incumbents might respond" analysis. WHOOP already has the exact sensor hardware — an IMU and optical heart rate in a wrist-worn band — plus the strength training user base generating the data needed to train competing algorithms. The barrier between WHOOP's current product and Fort's value proposition is a software update, not a hardware redesign. When I think about the companies in my portfolio that built lasting moats, they operated in spaces where complexity itself was the barrier — Anduril's defense procurement maze, Affirm's financial regulation labyrinth, Contraline's FDA pathway. Fort's competitive protection is algorithmic accuracy on commodity sensors, and a well-funded incumbent with more data could close that gap.

The co-founder dynamics are the one dimension where I see genuine positive signal. Three engineers who worked together at Tesla on adjacent programs — Cybertruck, Semi, Cybercab — chose to leave and build together. Shared work history under the intensity of Tesla manufacturing is meaningful. They've seen each other under pressure. That's not the same as having stress-tested their conflict resolution as co-founders, but it's better than strangers who met at a hackathon. Still, without evidence of how they handle real disagreements when the company is in crisis — and every hardware startup will face that crisis — I can't give full marks here.

Fort is a competent team with relevant experience building a reasonable product for a real gap in a growing market. For many investors, that's enough. For me, it's not. I need the founder story that won't let go, the idea that makes other investors uncomfortable, and the conviction that this company will change who gets access to what. Fort is well-built but it doesn't give me that jolt.
