# General Legal -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Here is what catches my eye first: everyone in legal AI builds software for lawyers. Harvey sells AI to BigLaw. Spellbook sells AI to lawyers. Robin AI sells AI to legal teams. They all do this because actually being a law firm is a schlep nobody wants. You need bar-licensed attorneys. You carry malpractice liability. You deal with state-by-state regulatory oversight. You have professional responsibility obligations that software companies never touch. Building SaaS for lawyers is the clean path. Being the law firm is the hard one. General Legal chose the hard one.

This is the same structural pattern I saw with Stripe. For a decade, every programmer knew payment processing was broken. Most people who noticed built tools for existing payment processors. The Collisons walked into the banks themselves. General Legal's founding team spent years at Cooley and Fenwick & West -- they were the expensive startup lawyers charging hundreds per hour for contract work. Then they went to Casetext and spent years building AI for legal text, watching that company get acquired by Thomson Reuters for $650 million. They've seen this problem from inside the machine: first as the practitioners delivering the overpriced, slow service, then as the engineers who know what can be automated. When people who have been inside a broken system for a decade decide to rebuild it from scratch, that's not a brainstormed idea. That's an organic discovery compounding over years. The fact that they chose to become a law firm rather than build another SaaS tool tells me they understand where the real leverage is -- and that they're willing to eat the schlep.

The team is unusually strong for a pre-seed company, and strong in the right way. Ryan Walker was CTO of Casetext through its entire arc to a $650M exit. He has a PhD in mathematics, published academic work on transformer-based legal text retrieval, and open-source NLP libraries with real adoption. Javed Qadrud-Din was Director of ML at Casetext and co-authored that same research. J.P. Mohler bridges both worlds -- Harvard Law JD, practiced at Cooley's venture capital group, then became a senior ML research scientist at Casetext. These aren't lawyers who hired engineers or engineers who hired lawyers. They're people who are simultaneously both. That combination is rare and directly relevant. They built the AI that made legal text searchable at scale; now they're applying it to contract review and negotiation as a service.

The traction signal is modest but real. Twenty-plus growth-stage companies moving their commercial contracting to General Legal since a private preview is meaningful because companies don't switch legal providers casually. Lawyers handle privileged information. Moving your contracting means you trust the new provider enough to hand them sensitive deals. That said, the free first contract offer muddies the signal somewhat -- I'd want to know how many of those twenty companies came back for a second paid engagement. At $500 per contract, the unit economics question looms large: can an AI-assisted attorney process enough contracts per day to generate venture-scale margins? If they genuinely achieve 10x the throughput of a traditional attorney, one lawyer doing the work of ten changes the math completely. But if complex contracts resist that compression, the flat-fee model becomes a margin trap.

The strongest bull case is this: being a licensed law firm is both the schlep and the moat. AI contract review tools are broadly available -- any attorney could theoretically adopt them. But building an AI-native law firm from scratch, with workflows designed around AI from day one rather than retrofitted onto hourly billing, is a fundamentally different organizational challenge. Traditional BigLaw cannot offer $500 flat-fee contracts without cannibalizing their own revenue model. SaaS companies cannot practice law without getting licensed. General Legal sits in the gap that neither side can easily reach. If the efficiency claims hold, this becomes the kind of business where the regulatory barrier that makes it hard to start also makes it hard to compete with once established.

My concern is whether this is a venture-scale outcome or a very good professional services business. Law firms scale by adding attorneys, not by adding servers. Even with 10x AI efficiency, the growth trajectory depends on hiring and training more lawyers, which constrains the exponential growth curve that makes startups worth funding. The $500 flat fee is compelling for customers but creates a ceiling on per-unit revenue. The generic brand name is a real nuisance for discovery. And Lawhive, sitting on $100M in funding, represents a well-capitalized competitor that could expand into this exact niche. Still, these are the kinds of problems that relentlessly resourceful founders navigate. The deeper question -- whether these founders will find creative ways to scale beyond the attorney-hours constraint, perhaps by productizing their workflows or expanding into adjacent practice areas -- is the bet you're making.

I'd invest. The organic discovery is genuine and multi-layered. The schlep is structural and will deter most competitors. The team built and exited a $650M legal AI company and chose to come back and do the harder version of this problem. The main risk is services-business scaling dynamics, but at pre-seed, that's a problem worth having if the foundation is right.
