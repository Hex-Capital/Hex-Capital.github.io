# Perfectly -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Over 100 AI recruiting startups launched in 2024 and 2025. One hundred. When I see that number, I know exactly what I'm looking at: a consensus market where every smart engineer with LLM access has independently concluded that "recruiting is broken" and arrived at roughly the same solution. Perfectly is entering a space where Alex raised $20M, Perfect raised $23M, Dover has Tiger Global backing, and Gem is doing $31M in revenue at a $1.2B valuation. This is not a company skating to where the puck will be -- this is a company arriving at the rink after warmups are over. When Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing would never work for public telecom, that was a signal. When 100 startups and 88% of recruiters all agree AI will transform hiring, that's the opposite signal.

Let me apply my first test: if Perfectly succeeds completely -- becomes the dominant AI recruiting agency, captures a massive share of the $32B U.S. staffing market -- what changes? Companies pay less for recruiting. Hiring cycles compress from months to days. Candidates get matched more accurately. These are real operational improvements. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete in a way that reshapes how society functions. Animal agriculture occupies half the planet's arable land -- that's a problem whose consequence of success justifies any risk. Recruiting fees consuming 20-25% of first-year salary is a business cost optimization. I've built my career on the distinction between these two magnitudes, and Perfectly sits firmly on the wrong side of it.

The founders have genuine technical depth -- Victor Luo as an ML Scientist at TikTok and Zhuang Luo as a Senior MLE at Meta with a NeurIPS 2025 publication. These are people who built recommendation systems serving billions. Their firsthand experience enduring 800+ agency-sourced interviews at TikTok gives them authentic problem knowledge. But this is precisely the pattern I warn against: experienced engineers from the incumbent ecosystem building a better version of what frustrated them at work. There's no outsider naivety here, no "irreverence and foolish confidence" that frees you to attempt what experts consider impossible. They've identified a real inefficiency and are applying their considerable skills to optimize it. That's how you build a good business. It's not how you build a transformational one.

The strongest bull case goes like this: the agency model is the right structural position. Unlike Dover, Gem, and most competitors who sell SaaS tools to human recruiters -- thereby preserving the incumbent labor force -- Perfectly replaces the recruiter entirely. Pay-per-placement means customers bear zero risk. If the matching algorithm is genuinely superior (and TikTok/Meta recommendation system DNA is a credible foundation for that claim), the data flywheel of accumulated hiring preferences and reusable candidate profiles could compound into a real moat. At near-zero marginal cost per placement versus a human recruiter's $80K+ salary, the unit economics could be devastating to traditional agencies. Robert Half and Randstad can't cannibalize their own recruiter workforce to compete. This could be a multi-billion dollar outcome. I acknowledge all of that. But a multi-billion dollar outcome from making a business process cheaper is not what I optimize for. Square didn't just make payments cheaper -- it fundamentally changed who could participate in the financial system. I don't see an equivalent structural unlock here. Perfectly makes recruiting faster and cheaper for companies that already have access to recruiting. The beneficiary is the enterprise budget, not the world.

The technology commoditization risk is severe. The core capabilities -- LLM-based outreach, semantic candidate matching, automated screening conversations -- run on foundation models that every competitor accesses. The dossier identifies no patents, no published IP, no open-source repositories, no proprietary data advantage beyond what they'll accumulate over time. The "data flywheel" is real but takes years to become defensible, and every competitor with earlier funding (Perfect's $23M, Alex's $20M) is accumulating the same data faster. When the underlying technology is a shared foundation model, execution quality is the only differentiator -- and execution advantages are temporary in a market with 100+ well-funded entrants.

These founders are too capable for a problem this manageable. Two ML scientists who understand matching at planetary scale, who published at NeurIPS, who worked at the companies that defined algorithmic recommendation -- and they're applying all of that to filling software engineering roles 2x faster. I'd rather see them attack something that terrifies them. The problem they've chosen has a clear path to a good business. That's exactly what concerns me. They've made the classic trade: they've minimized the probability of failure to the point where, in my framework, the consequence of success is insufficient to justify the attempt.
