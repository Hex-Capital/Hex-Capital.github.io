# Orthogonal -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my problem with Orthogonal: this is the most consensus idea in technology right now. Coinbase and Cloudflare launched x402. Stripe and OpenAI built ACP. Google shipped AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. Every single payments incumbent on the planet is building agent payment infrastructure. And into this, a two-person pre-seed startup walks in and says "we're going to be the aggregation layer for all of it." The founders -- Christian Pickett from Coinbase payments and Vercel billing, Bera Sogut from Google's API teams with two ICPC World Finals appearances -- are credible people. Clearly sane. But the idea isn't insane at all. It's the exact opposite. When I described Brian Armstrong and Coinbase, the key was that most of Silicon Valley dismissed Bitcoin entirely. Nobody is dismissing agentic payments. Every fund in the valley is trying to write a check in this category. That's precisely the configuration where startup returns get priced out before the company ships its first feature.

The structural issue cuts deeper than just being consensus. Orthogonal is explicitly an application-layer marketplace sitting above protocol-layer competitors. The dossier itself draws this distinction -- x402 is a protocol, ACP is a protocol, and Orthogonal is the aggregation and discovery layer that sits on top. My entire portfolio tells me that primitives compound and applications get absorbed. Venmo became a payment primitive. Solana became a protocol layer. Algorand, Aleo, Lightning Labs -- all protocol infrastructure. Orthogonal is building the thing that the protocol players will add as a feature within eighteen months. Coinbase already has the API provider relationships. Stripe already has every developer's billing information. When Stripe decides its ACP protocol should include API discovery -- and they will -- what exactly is Orthogonal's defense? Fourteen API integrations at launch? That's not a moat. That's a weekend sprint for a platform team at any of these companies.

Now run my AI kill test, and it gets worse. Would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is RapidAPI -- a conventional API marketplace that's been around for over a decade and never achieved anything close to protocol-layer dominance or winner-take-most dynamics. Strip away the AI agent wrapper and you have an API aggregation business, which is a known category with known limitations. The entire value proposition depends on AI agents becoming the dominant consumers of APIs at scale. That's not "cherry on top" -- that's "AI IS the business." If the next generation of agent frameworks builds API discovery and payment natively (which is exactly what the MCP ecosystem and competing protocols are moving toward), Orthogonal's layer gets compressed to nothing. The dossier even concedes: "The technical complexity of building an API aggregation and payment layer is moderate. Any well-funded competitor with marketplace-building experience could replicate the core functionality."

The bull case I genuinely considered: Orthogonal could become the developer-facing Stripe analog for agent infrastructure -- not building the rails, but building the abstraction layer that makes the rails usable. Stripe succeeded above Visa and Mastercard because PCI compliance, bank integrations, and fraud detection were genuinely painful for developers. If agent-to-API authentication, billing reconciliation, and skill packaging prove similarly painful at scale, and if Orthogonal nails the developer experience before the protocol players add their own aggregation features, the marketplace network effects could compound fast enough to create real lock-in. The founder pairing -- Coinbase payments plus Google API infrastructure -- is about as precise a credential match as you could design for this exact product. And the MCP integration gives them distribution into Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex users today, which is real. The crypto/Web3 tag on the YC profile hints at a possible stablecoin micropayment layer beneath the marketplace, which would push this closer to protocol territory. If that's the hidden roadmap, it's more interesting than what's on the surface.

But the bull case requires winning a supply-side density race against players with orders of magnitude more resources and existing developer relationships, in the most crowded emerging category in tech, with a software-based moat in a world where I've spent the last two years arguing that software moats are dissolving. The pay-per-call margin business is a thin-spread marketplace model that depends entirely on volume, and volume depends on winning the aggregation game against Stripe, Coinbase, and Google. The founders are building competently in the wrong structural position. I'd want to see them go deeper -- build the payment protocol itself, create a genuinely new primitive for agent identity and authentication that becomes infrastructure others depend on. As currently positioned, they're an application waiting to be absorbed by the protocols beneath them.
