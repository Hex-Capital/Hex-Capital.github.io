# Patientdesk.ai -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I look for when a company automates what its founders previously did by hand is whether the transition reveals deep technological insight or simply productizes an existing workflow. Özgül ran call centers for dental practices. Koktas and Özgül built ESO Marketing Automations, a dental agency. They know what the front desk does wrong, which PMS systems matter, how insurance verification breaks down. That's genuine operational knowledge -- it's not nothing. But it's the kind of knowledge any competent operator would accumulate after eighteen months in the dental vertical. It doesn't pass my core filter: what does this founder know that can't be taught? The workflows of a dental front desk can absolutely be taught. They can be documented in a manual. They're being documented in a manual right now -- by every AI voice agent company targeting healthcare. The specific knowledge here is operational, not architectural. It tells you what to build. It doesn't tell you something non-obvious about how to build it.

The technical founder question is where this falls apart for me. None of the three founders have public GitHub profiles. Koktas has physics and math from Pomona and is currently completing -- not finished -- an ML master's at Aalto. That's a trajectory, not a credential. Kaplaner comes from a Nordic holding company focused on manufacturing. Özgül studied economics. I require a technologist on the founding team who has built the core product themselves. "This is the technology business, and you want to be investing in technology teams." The hard problem in AI voice agents isn't understanding dental workflows -- it's building sub-second latency voice models that handle the ambiguity of real patient conversations, integrate with fragmented PMS APIs in real time, and maintain reliability at scale. That's an engineering challenge, and I don't see evidence that this team has the technical depth to win it. Arini, their direct YC competitor from W24, was founded by MIT and Harvard CS engineers who were early at Threads. That's a team built to solve the hard technical problem. This team is built to understand the customer.

The leverage architecture is standard vertical SaaS -- not the kind of nonlinear leverage I invest for. Each dental practice is a separate sale, a separate PMS integration, a separate configuration. There's no network effect: one clinic using Patientdesk doesn't make the product better for another clinic. Compare this to Stack Overflow, where every question answered made the platform more valuable for every future developer. Or Notion, where every template created by one user became leverage for millions of others. Patientdesk scales with sales effort, not with usage. At $1,000 per location per month with 60+ clinics, they might be approaching $60K MRR -- which is respectable traction for pre-seed. But the growth curve will be linear until they find a distribution mechanism that doesn't require per-clinic onboarding. Their prior agency relationships may accelerate early sales, but agency distribution channels tend to cap out quickly.

The timing is consensus, not contrarian. AI voice agents in healthcare is one of the most crowded categories in the current YC ecosystem. Arini is building the same product one batch ahead. Sully.ai has raised $35M for a broader healthcare AI employee suite. Weave, already in 35,000+ dental locations with $230M in trailing revenue, is adding AI receptionist features. When I invested in Uber at a $4M valuation, ride-sharing was illegal and most smart people thought it was a terrible idea. When I backed Bitcoin in 2014, it was dismissed as nerd money. The asymmetric upside comes from being non-consensus and right. Patientdesk is consensus -- and the pricing already reflects it. The dental AI receptionist market will probably work. The question is whether a three-person team in Amsterdam, spread across three countries, wins the race against better-funded competitors with stronger technical teams and established distribution.

The strongest bull case: the agency-to-SaaS transition has worked before, and founders who've physically answered the phones understand edge cases that pure technologists miss. Sixty clinics is real usage, not a waitlist. The 15+ PMS integrations represent genuine engineering work that creates switching costs. And the dental market is fragmented enough that a focused vertical player could build a strong position before Weave's bundled offering catches up. If Koktas finishes his ML program and proves to be a strong technical builder, if they focus on one geography instead of three, and if they can build a distribution flywheel beyond their agency network -- there's a path to a meaningful business. But "meaningful business" and "asymmetric upside" are different things. I'm looking for companies that create new categories of leverage, not companies that automate existing workflows more efficiently. This is a dental receptionist that happens to use AI, not an AI system that transforms how healthcare operates.

I also note some metric ambiguity on the website -- figures like "$12.4M revenue" and "$8.2M" that appear to represent customer revenue generated through the platform, not Patientdesk's own revenue, without clear labeling. The discrepancy between $500K reported funding and $1M claimed on the website is a small flag. These aren't dealbreakers, but when I'm investing my own money, I pay attention to how founders present numbers. Precision in public claims is a low-cost signal of integrity.
