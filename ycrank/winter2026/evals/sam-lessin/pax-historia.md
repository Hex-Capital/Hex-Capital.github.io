# Pax Historia -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that immediately jumps out: Pax Historia is processing 100+ billion AI tokens per week and has hit 35,000 daily active users in four months without spending a dollar on acquisition. That's not nothing. That's exceptional consumer execution by any standard. But I need to be honest about what I'm actually looking at structurally, because this company sits squarely in the category I've been publicly warning people about for over a year. If you remove the AI, there is no game. The AI isn't the cherry on top -- it's the entire sundae, the bowl, and the table it's sitting on. My "cherry on top" test exists precisely to filter out companies like this.

The sane-person-insane-idea calibration here doesn't work for me. Eli Bullock-Papa is still finishing his engineering degree at Virginia Tech, with work experience at Capital One and Olive Garden. Ryan Zhang's YC bio is "I like history." I'm not dismissing young founders -- I've backed plenty -- but the "sane" in my framework means someone whose specific background makes you believe they can execute on THIS particular vision in a way that most people can't. A Qualcomm systems engineer building a Layer 1 blockchain is sane-person credibility because the domain expertise is directly relevant. What I see here is impressive raw hustle and shipping speed, which matters, but it's a different signal than deep operator credibility in gaming infrastructure, AI systems, or geopolitical modeling. And the idea itself? "AI-powered strategy game" is not insane. It's consensus. Every game company on earth is thinking about how to integrate generative AI. Paradox Interactive has already announced AI-driven procedural content generation for Europa Universalis V. When the incumbents are moving toward your idea, it's not insane -- it's obvious.

The structural moat question is where this falls apart for me. I keep coming back to AI Dungeon. Latitude hit 1.5 million monthly actives by 2021 with the same structural formula: third-party LLM inference powering emergent narrative, explosive viral growth driven by novelty, passionate early community. AI Dungeon has since faded into relative obscurity. The pattern -- AI novelty drives viral adoption, then retention craters as the novelty wears off and competitors emerge with better models -- is established enough that I need a compelling reason to believe Pax Historia breaks it. The UGC preset marketplace with 4,000+ community-published scenarios and the 10% creator commission is the most structurally interesting element here. It's the beginning of a content flywheel. But 4,000 presets is a library that a motivated competitor could replicate in weeks. The 60% AI cost reduction through Infron's multi-model routing is operational competence, not proprietary advantage -- Infron sells that capability to everyone. The company has no proprietary model weights, no unique data moat, and the core technical stack (LLM inference + browser maps + prompt engineering) is made of commodity components. When I think about what happens in eighteen months when every gaming company has access to better, cheaper AI models, I don't see what structurally prevents replication.

The strongest bull case, and I want to give it genuine weight: if Pax Historia becomes the platform where creators build and monetize alternate-history scenarios -- the "YouTube of strategy simulation" -- then the UGC network effects could compound faster than anyone can replicate. Two community wikis, an active subreddit, a Discord, someone building autonomous agents to play the game on Hacker News -- these are real community love signals. The map-based geopolitical visualization is a genuine differentiator from text-only AI adventures. And the timing window matters: foundation models just crossed the quality threshold for real-time geopolitical narrative, and no well-funded competitor has staked out this specific niche. If these founders can convert their early user base into a creator economy with real switching costs before the window closes, the infinity story writes itself -- from grand strategy to all simulation gaming to geopolitical education to policy modeling tools. I can see that narrative expanding. But "if they can build network effects before the window closes" is a bet on speed against Paradox's resources, and I've seen that movie end badly more often than not.

This is a company with legitimately impressive early traction that fails my structural tests. The AI-first positioning, the consensus nature of the idea, the commodity tech stack, and the young founders without deep domain credibility all point in the same direction. I'd rather fund the company building the infrastructure layer that games like Pax Historia run on -- the multi-model routing protocol, the AI game engine primitive -- than the application sitting on top of someone else's models. The founders have demonstrated they can ship and grow, and that's a skill that transfers. But this particular business, in this particular structural position, doesn't survive my moat analysis.
