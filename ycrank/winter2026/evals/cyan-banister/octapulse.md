# OctaPulse -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I notice about OctaPulse is what's missing from the founders' story. When I sit down with a founder, before I look at anything else, I want to hear how they arrived at this specific problem -- the personal thread that makes this inevitable for them rather than optional. Paul Grech was a UX project manager at Bloomberg. Rohan Singh built things at Tesla and NVIDIA. Both are at Carnegie Mellon. These are obviously capable people. But neither has any documented connection to aquaculture, fisheries, or farming of any kind. Grech has a "stated personal passion for ocean conservation" from a business school profile, and that's the entire biographical bridge to building the future of fish farming. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research that other people considered a dead end -- his life's work and the company's mission were the same thing. When I wrote my first check to SpaceX, Elon wasn't dabbling in rockets because he'd identified an interesting market -- he was consumed by an existential conviction about making life multi-planetary. I don't feel that inseparability here. This reads as two smart grad students who identified an underserved vertical through research and competition prep, not founders who are solving something that has shaped them.

The company itself is a competent application of computer vision to manual fish inspection, and I want to be fair about what's working. A six-figure paid pilot with Riverence -- the largest trout producer in the United States -- at pre-seed stage is genuinely meaningful. Someone is paying real money for this, which is more than most YC companies can say at this stage. The 90-95% accuracy claim and the 10x speed improvement over manual inspection are solid technical metrics. These aren't trivial achievements. And the hatchery-first positioning is a smart wedge -- Tidal and Aquabyte are focused on grow-out pens for salmon, so OctaPulse has found a niche that the bigger players haven't claimed yet.

But here's what concerns me about the opportunity as I see it through my lens: applying computer vision to replace manual biological inspection is not a weird idea. It's not unpopular. It's the most obvious application of CV to any industry with visual QA -- you could swap "fish" for "produce" or "semiconductor wafers" or "auto parts" and the pitch would sound almost identical. I invest in things that make other investors uncomfortable, that seem slightly ridiculous, that take real conviction to back. Mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota? That's the kind of idea that gets you laughed out of most rooms. Automating fish inspection with cameras? That gets you a polite nod and a question about market size. The aquaculture vertical itself is niche enough that most VCs would pass, but they'd pass because of market unfamiliarity, not because the idea challenges any assumptions. I look for the second kind of discomfort, not the first.

The bull case I want to genuinely engage with: aquaculture has just crossed a historic threshold -- surpassing wild-catch as the primary global seafood source. That inflection point is real and creates genuine urgency around industrializing what has been an artisanal process. OctaPulse could become the operating system for hatchery QA at exactly the moment hatcheries need to scale. The data moat from labeled multi-species images compounds with each deployment. If they execute on the land-and-expand strategy -- hatchery QA today, feeding optimization and health monitoring tomorrow -- they could build something that looks more like a platform than a point solution. And the competitive dynamics are actually interesting: Aquaticode is the closest competitor but is focused on European markets (salmon, bass, bream), while OctaPulse has planted its flag in U.S. trout. Geographic and species separation could give them room to build before a direct collision. If you believe hatchery-stage is where the real leverage is in the supply chain -- catching defects upstream before wasting downstream resources -- then the market position is genuinely strategic.

But I keep coming back to what I weigh most heavily. The founders haven't been told "no" by dozens of investors and kept going out of sheer biographical necessity. They've been winning academic competitions -- $70K SICA grant, $20K McGinnis prize, $10K Ocean Exchange award. That's institutional validation, which is actually the opposite of the signal I trust. The companies that have made me the most money were the ones nobody wanted to fund, not the ones collecting awards. And on economic access -- the dimension where I ask whether a company creates opportunity for underserved people or makes invisible systems visible to those who lack power -- OctaPulse is fundamentally a B2B efficiency tool for fish farm operators. It saves them money on technician labor. That's a real value proposition, but it's not Uber creating income for drivers or Affirm making credit transparent. The impact pathway to the people I care about helping is distant at best.

The co-founder dynamic is hard to evaluate with what's available. They met at CMU, competed together at McGinnis, and now they're building together. I notice that a third team member, Andres Castrillon, was listed at the 2025 competition but isn't on the YC page -- that could mean anything, but early team changes always make me want to ask questions. With a team of two, there's no avoiding the dynamic between them, and I'd want to understand how they've navigated disagreements before I could get comfortable. My lesson from HQ Trivia hasn't faded.
