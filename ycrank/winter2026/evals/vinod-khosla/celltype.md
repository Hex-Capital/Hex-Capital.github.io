# CellType -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

The most interesting thing about CellType isn't the AI drug discovery label — that space is crowded with well-funded companies all claiming to transform pharma. What stops me is the underlying insight: biology is language. David van Dijk took single-cell gene expression data and converted it into sequences of gene names ordered by expression level, then handed it to large language models and said: reason about this. That's not an incremental improvement to molecular docking or phenomic screening. That's a reconceptualization of how computation relates to biology. It reminds me of what Pradeep Sindhu did at Juniper — he didn't build a better Cisco router, he said networking should be built around TCP/IP from the ground up when Cisco's CTO told me they'd never do it. CellType isn't saying "let's use AI to speed up drug discovery." They're saying the entire foundation of biological computation should be rebuilt as a language problem, and then everything LLMs can do — reasoning, generation, prediction — becomes available for biology. The fact that Google DeepMind co-developed the 27-billion-parameter model and Sundar Pichai personally amplified the research to seven million people tells me that the world's most capable AI organization validated this paradigm, which is significant.

Now let me talk about consequence magnitude. If CellType succeeds — if you can genuinely build a "virtual human" that simulates drug responses, predicts toxicity, stratifies patients, and runs computational clinical trials — you are looking at one of the most consequential technological achievements in medicine. Drug discovery consumes roughly $250 billion annually in R&D spend, with a 90% failure rate that represents incalculable human suffering. A reliable computational model of human biology doesn't just make drug discovery cheaper; it makes previously uneconomic therapeutic targets viable. Rare diseases that no pharma company will invest in because the patient population can't support a $1 billion development cost? Suddenly viable. The consequence of success here isn't a better tool for Pfizer's existing pipeline — it's a fundamental restructuring of how humanity discovers medicines. That consequence is large enough to justify significant risk tolerance on my part.

The competitive dynamics are where most investors would get nervous, and I understand why. Isomorphic Labs has $600 million. Recursion has $461 million. Insilico is public with a drug in Phase II. CellType is two people with YC pre-seed capital. But I've seen this movie before. The question isn't how much capital your competitors have — it's whether your technological approach is fundamentally different enough that their capital is being deployed against a different problem. Isomorphic works on protein structure prediction via AlphaFold. Recursion does phenomic screening from cell images. Insilico uses generative chemistry. None of them are doing what CellType is doing — converting cellular transcriptomics into language and letting LLMs reason about cellular states. These competitors have billions of dollars optimizing molecular-level or image-level approaches. CellType is operating at a different abstraction layer entirely. If biology-as-language turns out to be the right paradigm, all that competing capital is pointed in the wrong direction.

What gives me genuine pause is the structural vulnerability. The Cell2Sentence paper is published, the code has 809 stars on GitHub, and the trained models sit on Hugging Face for anyone to download. The core scientific insight is fully open. I learned from KiOR that technology achievement without defensible economics is a trap — and here the technology achievement is literally given away. The defensible value has to come from the agentic orchestration layer, proprietary validation data, and pharma relationships, none of which have public evidence of maturity. More critically, Google DeepMind co-developed C2S-Scale and could decide to pursue this commercially through Isomorphic Labs rather than through CellType. The IP arrangements are undisclosed. Building your core technology in partnership with a company that owns a direct competitor is a structural risk that could become existential. I need to understand those IP terms before I'd commit at scale.

Van Dijk's profile is compelling but not perfectly aligned with what I look for. He's created two foundational methods — MAGIC and PHATE — that became standard tools across computational biology. His 8,895 citations represent genuine scientific impact. He turned down Google to build this company. That's conviction. But he's not a classic outsider in my sense. He's one of the world's leading computational biologists applying his deep expertise to drug discovery. That's closer to an expert extending their domain than a naive outsider attacking a problem from first principles. The strongest signal of outsider thinking is the Cell2Sentence paradigm itself — a computational biologist telling the drug discovery establishment that biology should be treated as language. That's a genuinely contrarian claim within the field. The team of two, both from Yale with no commercial leadership, concerns me less at pre-seed than it would later. What matters now is whether van Dijk can attract the kind of people who build commercial drug discovery platforms — regulatory strategists, enterprise sales leaders, clinical development experts. His academic reputation and Google DeepMind relationship suggest he can recruit at a high level, but there's no evidence yet of building beyond the research team.

I'd write a check here — a small one, structured as an option. This is exactly my $1 million option-value framework: either the money expires, or biology-as-language turns out to be the right paradigm for computational drug discovery and CellType becomes the defining platform. The consequence of success is too large and the technological insight too genuinely novel to pass. But I'd want clarity on three things before committing: the IP arrangements with Google DeepMind, van Dijk's plan to recruit commercial leadership in the first six months, and a more detailed understanding of what the proprietary agentic layer actually does versus what's open-source. The gap between published foundation models and a defensible enterprise product is where this company will succeed or fail.
