# Synthetic Sciences -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape here tells you everything you need to know before you open the product. Google announced its own AI Co-Scientist in February 2025. Periodic Labs raised $300 million. Edison Scientific raised $70 million. Elicit has 400,000 monthly researchers and is approaching $20 million in ARR. Sciloop -- funded by YC one batch earlier -- automates the identical ML experimentation pipeline with founders who are International Physics Olympiad medalists from MIT CSAIL. When I count five well-capitalized players converging on the same thesis in the same 18-month window, I am not looking at a market with a secret. I am looking at a market where the insight is consensus and the outcome is mutual destruction. "AI will automate scientific research" is not a contrarian truth -- it is the most popular prediction in technology today. Every VC deck, every Google keynote, every university provost's annual letter says the same thing. Where everyone agrees, there is nothing hidden, and where there is nothing hidden, there is no monopoly.

The founders are genuinely remarkable, and I want to be precise about this because exceptional talent deployed against a consensus thesis is a particular kind of tragedy. Aayam Bansal has fifteen publications across ICML, IEEE, and ACL at age eighteen. He has held research positions at MIT CSAIL, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, Oxford, and NUS. He has a prior exit. Ishaan Gangwani represented India at the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence and holds USACO Platinum standing. Both are Z-Fellows and Emergent Ventures recipients -- these are the talent-identification networks adjacent to my own fellowship program, and the signal they produce is real. If I were evaluating these two founders on raw intellectual capability alone, they would rank in the top decile of any cohort. But capability is necessary and not sufficient. Vitalik Buterin had the Thiel Fellowship and built Ethereum -- a genuinely contrarian bet on programmable money that most serious computer scientists dismissed as either impossible or pointless. These founders are building a workflow orchestration layer on top of commodity LLMs and commodity GPU providers, in a market where Google could ship the same product as a feature update to Colab.

The technology question sharpens the problem. The platform integrates twelve external services -- Hugging Face, Modal, Lambda GPU, Pinecone, Together AI, Groq, Fireworks -- and bundles ninety-three pre-built research skills. This is integration, not invention. The dossier states plainly: "The core components -- LLM-based agents, GPU orchestration, paper search APIs -- are individually accessible." When every component of your technology stack is available to your competitors, what you have built is a convenience, not a moat. A convenience that charges fifty dollars a month to graduate students who have no budget. The claimed data flywheel -- usage generates process data for RL training -- is the standard pitch of every AI application company in 2025, and I have yet to see evidence that Synthetic Sciences has produced proprietary models, published benchmarks, or built anything that could not be replicated by a competent team in three months with access to the same APIs.

The brand confusion between InkVell and Synthetic Sciences deserves specific attention because it reveals something about the founders' planning horizon. Earlier press describes InkVell as "an AI-powered platform addressing research and document productivity" -- essentially a better LaTeX editor. The syntheticsciences.ai website is copyrighted to Inkvell Inc. A separate inkvell.ai domain exists. The product has expanded from document productivity to a five-mode AI co-scientist platform with research, coding, writing, planning, and fine-tuning capabilities. This trajectory -- broad, exploratory, responsive to market signals -- is precisely what I mean by indefinite optimism. A founder with a definite vision knows what their company will be in ten years. A founder who pivots from document editing to full-pipeline research automation within six months is testing hypotheses, not executing a plan. Lean methodology is what happens when you do not have a secret strong enough to commit to.

The strongest bull case would require believing that the data flywheel is real and unique -- that Synthetic Sciences will accumulate proprietary training signal from researcher workflows faster than Google, faster than Edison Scientific with its $70 million, faster than Periodic Labs with its $300 million and its ex-OpenAI VP. It would require believing that computational ML research is a sufficiently distinct domain that physical-world research competitors are irrelevant, and that Sciloop -- building the same product one YC batch ahead -- will somehow fail to capture the same niche. It would require believing that two eighteen-year-olds without completed undergraduate degrees can build enterprise sales motions for institutional customers while simultaneously developing RL training infrastructure and maintaining ninety-three research skills across twelve integrations. Each of these beliefs is individually possible. Their conjunction strains credulity. The power law demands that I invest only where the probability-weighted outcome is extreme, and a crowded market with commodity technology and no visible secret does not produce extreme outcomes. It produces the median: a decent product used by some researchers, generating modest revenue, eventually outcompeted or acqui-hired by a larger platform. That is not a fund-returning investment. That is competition.
