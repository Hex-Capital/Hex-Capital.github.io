## The Idea

**Problem:** Over 100,000 drones, submarines, and satellites are being built annually in the US, but the legacy battery pack supply chain cannot keep pace (YC company page). Custom aerospace-grade battery packs currently require 6–12 months each for design, qualification, and volume production phases through legacy suppliers (kytentech.com). Additionally, NDAA Section 842 of the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits DoD procurement of advanced batteries from foreign entities of concern beginning January 1, 2028, with phased expansion thereafter (Morgan Lewis, Dec 2025 via search snippet). The FCC added all foreign-produced UAS critical components—including batteries and battery management systems—to its Covered List in December 2025, prohibiting new equipment authorizations for foreign-produced UAS equipment (Wiley, Dec 2025 via search snippet). These regulatory shifts are forcing US aerospace and defense manufacturers to re-source battery supply chains domestically.

**Approach:** Kyten provides turn-key design, qualification, and manufacturing of custom aerospace-grade battery packs, compressing each phase to approximately one week (kytentech.com). The company supports all cell chemistries and form factors with fully customizable pack geometries. Capabilities include automated software-defined test and manufacturing systems, in-house qualification, integrated battery management systems with customer-selected protocols, thermal control systems, engineered transportation cases, and multiple interconnect options including wire bonded, spot welded, and laser welded (kytentech.com). Target verticals include manned and unmanned aircraft, space (launch vehicles and spacecraft), surface and subsea marine vessels, and ground vehicles (kytentech.com).

**Differentiation:** Kyten's claimed differentiation is speed—design in one week, qualify in one week, volume production in one week—versus 6–12 months per phase with legacy suppliers (kytentech.com). Unlike cell manufacturers such as Amprius Technologies (which manufactures silicon anode battery cells) or battery chemistry startups, Kyten is a pack-level integrator and manufacturer. Compared to established pack manufacturers like EaglePicher Technologies (which has powered 600+ satellites) or Custom Power (operating since 1965, AS9100D/ITAR certified), Kyten claims faster development cycles built on SpaceX-derived automated test and manufacturing processes. Electric Power Systems (EPS), backed by Boeing, Safran, and United Airlines, focuses primarily on certifiable aviation propulsion battery systems rather than broad custom pack manufacturing across aerospace verticals.

**Business Model:** No pricing page is visible on kytentech.com. [Inferred]: Most likely monetization is per-unit manufacturing contracts for custom battery packs, with engineering services (design and qualification) either bundled into unit pricing or charged as NRE (non-recurring engineering) fees, consistent with aerospace contract manufacturing norms.

**TAM/SAM:** The Aerospace and Defense Battery Market was valued at $10.41 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $22.85 billion by 2035 at 8.3% CAGR (InsightAce Analytic, 2026 via search snippet). A narrower aerospace battery market estimate puts the figure at $207.0 million in 2024 growing to $334.8 million by 2034 (Stratview Research via search snippet). The Drone (UAV) Battery Market specifically is projected to reach $2.41 billion by 2030, from $1.59 billion in 2025 (MarketsandMarkets via search snippet). The aircraft battery market is projected to grow from $1.61 billion in 2025 to $2.40 billion by 2030 at 8.3% CAGR (MarketsandMarkets via search snippet). [Inferred]: Kyten's SAM is the custom aerospace-grade battery pack segment within these broader markets, focused on US-manufactured packs for defense and commercial aerospace customers requiring rapid turnaround.

**GTM / Distribution:** [Inferred]: Most likely distribution path is direct sales to US aerospace and defense OEMs building drones, satellites, launch vehicles, and marine vessels. The founders' SpaceX and Shield AI networks provide initial customer access. The NDAA and FCC regulatory changes create a forcing function for US aerospace companies to re-source battery packs domestically, potentially generating inbound demand from companies seeking compliant suppliers.

## Defensibility

The founders cite six years of experience deploying battery packs at SpaceX Starlink, with 5,000–6,000+ packs deployed to low earth orbit (YC page cites 5,000+; kytentech.com cites 6,000+). The automated software-defined test and manufacturing systems referenced on the website represent potential process IP, though no patents have been identified in public sources. Aerospace qualification processes (MIL-STD, DO-160, etc.) create switching costs once a customer has qualified a specific battery pack design for their platform.

**Market structure:** NDAA Section 842 and the FCC Covered List create regulatory barriers that exclude foreign-manufactured batteries from US defense applications beginning 2028 (NDAA) and immediately for new FCC equipment authorizations (Dec 2025). This limits the competitive set to US-based manufacturers with domestic supply chains. Established foreign manufacturers (e.g., Saft/France, GS Yuasa/Japan) face structural barriers serving US defense customers under these new rules. Large US incumbents like EaglePicher are acquisition targets (Tuthill Corporation acquired EaglePicher in October 2023 via search snippet) rather than agile startups, and their long development cycles (the legacy 6–12 month timeline Kyten contrasts against) reflect organizational structures optimized for different production cadences.

**Commoditization risk:** Battery pack integration—as opposed to cell chemistry R&D—is an engineering and manufacturing discipline that multiple companies can perform. Custom Power, CRG Defense (Miamisburg, Ohio), Alexander Battery Technologies, and Mobile Power Solutions all offer custom aerospace battery pack manufacturing. The barrier is in achieving both aerospace qualification credentials and rapid turnaround simultaneously. New entrants with aerospace experience could replicate the approach, though the SpaceX-derived manufacturing process knowledge provides a head start.

**Competitive landscape:**

1. **EaglePicher Technologies** — Established US manufacturer (founded 1843) powering 600+ satellites currently in orbit. Annual revenue ~$236.7M (Growjo via search snippet). Acquired by Tuthill Corporation in October 2023. Key differentiator vs. Kyten: deep heritage and qualification across space, defense, and medical; long track record. Weakness relative to Kyten's pitch: legacy development timelines.

2. **Amprius Technologies (AMPX)** — Publicly traded silicon anode battery cell manufacturer. Q3 2025 revenue of $21.4M, guided FY2025 revenue of $66.88M (Yahoo Finance, Nov 2025 via search snippet). $53.3M backlog (Seeking Alpha via search snippet). $50M DOE grant, $1.5M DIU award (2025). Key differentiator vs. Kyten: Amprius manufactures proprietary high-energy-density cells, while Kyten is a pack-level integrator. ~75% of Amprius Q3 revenue came from aviation/UAS segment (Yahoo Finance via search snippet).

3. **Electric Power Systems (EPS)** — Backed by Boeing, Safran, JetBlue, and United Airlines across multiple rounds (series A in 2019, additional rounds through 2023). Revenue unknown. Powered NASA X-57 and Bell Nexus flight demonstrators. Key differentiator vs. Kyten: focused on certifiable aviation propulsion energy storage, not broad custom pack manufacturing.

4. **Evolito** — UK-based, spun out from YASA in 2021. $57M raised (Series A) from Innovate UK, B-FLEXION Capital, Oxford Science Enterprises (Tracxn via search snippet). Partnered with Vertical Aerospace for eVTOL propulsion. Key differentiator vs. Kyten: focused on electric motors and propulsion systems for eVTOL aircraft, broader than pure battery packs.

5. **CRG Defense** — US-based (Miamisburg, Ohio) manufacturer of advanced battery cells, packs, motors, and propulsion systems. Positions as NDAA-compliant domestic supplier. Funding and revenue unknown. Key differentiator vs. Kyten: manufactures both cells and packs; established defense manufacturing facility.

**Why now:** Two specific regulatory catalysts emerged in late 2025: (1) NDAA Section 842 (signed into law in the FY 2026 NDAA) prohibits DoD procurement of advanced batteries from foreign entities of concern starting January 1, 2028 (Morgan Lewis, Dec 2025 via search snippet); (2) the FCC added all foreign-produced UAS batteries and critical components to its Covered List on December 22, 2025, immediately prohibiting new equipment authorizations (Wiley, Dec 2025 via search snippet). [Inferred]: These regulatory changes create urgent demand for domestic battery pack manufacturing capacity, as US drone and defense OEMs that previously sourced from China or other foreign suppliers must now find compliant alternatives. Additionally, the rapid growth of commercial and military drone fleets—the UAV battery market growing from $1.59B to $2.41B by 2030 (MarketsandMarkets via search snippet)—increases the volume of battery packs required.

**Co-founder relationship:** Both founders worked at SpaceX/Starlink, with overlapping tenure in hardware test and manufacturing roles. The YC page describes their shared experience: "During our six years at Starlink, we put 5,000+ battery packs into space." Both hold Electrical Engineering degrees with complementary specializations (Power Electronics for McBride, Power Systems for Maddox).

**Founder-market fit:** Both founders spent years directly building and testing battery packs at SpaceX Starlink at scale, with firsthand experience in automated test systems and high-rate aerospace production. McBride's additional experience at Shield AI (autonomous military drones) provides direct exposure to the defense drone customer segment. Maddox's experience co-founding a solar car team indicates early hands-on energy systems work. Both hold EE degrees with power-specific specializations relevant to battery pack design.

## Key Risks

**Aerospace qualification timeline risk:** While Kyten claims one-week qualification, aerospace customers typically require adherence to standards such as MIL-STD-810, DO-160, or mission-specific qualification protocols that can require months of environmental testing, vibration testing, and reliability demonstration. If "one week" refers to internal screening rather than full customer-accepted qualification, the actual customer onboarding cycle may still be long. No public evidence of completed qualifications under Kyten's own name was found.

**Capital intensity of manufacturing scale-up:** Battery pack manufacturing requires significant capital investment in facilities, equipment, and inventory (cells, BMS components, thermal management materials). Scaling from a two-person team to a factory capable of serving multiple aerospace OEMs simultaneously will require substantial follow-on funding. The standard YC deal (~$500K) provides limited runway for hardware manufacturing buildout.

**Incumbent entrenchment in defense procurement:** Defense prime contractors (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris) have established supply chain relationships with qualified battery vendors like EaglePicher, which has powered 600+ satellites (EaglePicher website). Breaking into defense procurement typically requires lengthy vendor qualification processes, facility security clearances (ITAR registration, etc.), and relationship-building with prime contractor supply chain teams.

**Cell supply dependency:** Kyten is a pack integrator, not a cell manufacturer. Pack performance and availability depend on sourcing cells from third-party manufacturers. If NDAA Section 842 constraints tighten further or if key cell suppliers face capacity limitations, Kyten's production could be bottlenecked by cell availability. Amprius's recent contract manufacturing agreement with a South Korean manufacturer (Manufacturing Dive, 2025 via search snippet) illustrates the complexity of cell sourcing under NDAA compliance.

**Brand disambiguation:** A separate company called "Kyten" (getkyten.com, a virtual events platform) holds the linkedin.com/company/kyten LinkedIn page. "Kayten Technologies" (a German IT/embedded systems company with 613 LinkedIn followers) also has a similar name. This may create confusion in online discovery and could complicate trademark or domain positioning.
