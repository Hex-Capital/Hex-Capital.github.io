# shortkit -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

Six years building the infrastructure that powers YouTube Shorts is not a line on a resume -- it's the kind of knowledge that exists nowhere in any textbook, any tutorial, any bootcamp. Michael Seleman knows what happens to adaptive bitrate transcoding under load patterns that only three platforms on Earth have ever experienced. He knows which feed ranking signals actually move retention and which ones are noise. He knows the architectural decisions that seem right at 10,000 concurrent viewers and catastrophically wrong at 10 million. That's specific knowledge in the truest sense -- you can't train someone to have it, and if you could, you'd need to give them YouTube's infrastructure and six years. When I evaluate ShortKit, this is the gravitational center. The question isn't whether the founder knows the domain. The question is whether the domain he knows maps to the company he's building.

And this is where the thesis gets complicated. Building YouTube Shorts infrastructure at Google and packaging short-form video as an embeddable SDK for other apps are related problems, but they're not the same problem. The first is a systems engineering challenge at planetary scale. The second is a developer experience challenge at the integration layer. Seleman's knowledge gives him a massive head start on the "what should the system do" question, but the "how do developers adopt it" question requires different muscle. Neil Bhammar brings operational and sales experience from BusRight -- a school bus routing startup serving institutional buyers -- which is a real company-building credential but adds zero video domain depth. The founding team has a strong technologist and a capable operator, but the operator's specific knowledge (enterprise sales to school districts) doesn't compound with the technologist's knowledge in any obvious way. Compare this to how Amjad Masad at Replit brought both deep systems knowledge AND an obsessive understanding of how developers learn -- that double-helix of specific knowledge is what I look for at the highest level.

The leverage test reveals the core limitation. ShortKit is infrastructure -- and I systematically back infrastructure over applications. But not all infrastructure creates equal leverage. Stripe gave every developer on Earth the ability to accept payments with seven lines of code -- that's a new capability that didn't exist before. Twilio turned every application into a communications platform. ShortKit saves a consumer app team three to six months of engineering time building a short-form video feed. That's valuable, but it's an efficiency gain, not a new form of leverage. The product doesn't enable a fundamentally new type of builder or a fundamentally new type of experience -- it makes an existing experience cheaper to build. Every component underneath (HLS transcoding, CDN delivery, video player SDKs) is independently available. The value is in the vertical bundling and optimization, not in a new primitive. I'd be more excited if ShortKit were creating leverage that enabled a category of app that couldn't exist before, rather than making an existing category easier to construct.

The timing question matters. "Every app wants short-form video" is consensus, not contrarian. The contrarian bet buried inside ShortKit is narrower: that embeddable short-form video infrastructure is a large enough standalone market to sustain an independent company, and that Mux ($177M raised, $46M revenue, 4,900 customers) won't simply build this as a feature. That's a real bet, but it's a fragile one. Mux has the customer relationships, the brand trust among developers, and the underlying video infrastructure already running. Building a short-form feed SDK on top of their existing platform would be a natural vertical extension, not a strategic contradiction. ShortKit's argument has to be that the specialization gap is deep enough that a general-purpose platform can't match a purpose-built solution -- the same argument every vertical SaaS company makes against the horizontal incumbent. Sometimes that argument is right (Figma vs. Adobe), but it requires the vertical to be genuinely deep and the user experience gap to be enormous. I don't see evidence yet that the gap between "use Mux plus build your own feed logic" and "use ShortKit" is wide enough to sustain a company through the inevitable incumbent response.

The strongest bull case: if short-form vertical video becomes as embedded in consumer apps as maps or messaging -- a baseline expectation rather than a feature -- then ShortKit is positioned at exactly the right infrastructure layer. Mapbox built a multi-billion-dollar business because every app needed maps and nobody wanted to build mapping infrastructure from scratch. If we're entering an era where every consumer app needs a video feed and nobody wants to build feed infrastructure, ShortKit with its YouTube-pedigreed founder is the obvious picks-and-shovels play. The iOS-only limitation at launch is a constraint but also an architectural signal: zero third-party dependencies, native performance optimization -- this is how you'd build it if you genuinely understood that video feed performance is the product. If Seleman can translate his Google-scale systems knowledge into a developer experience that makes integration feel effortless, and if the market for embeddable video feeds proves to be broad rather than niche, this could compound into something significant. That's a plausible future, but it requires the market size assumption to be validated -- and right now, the number of non-social-media apps that genuinely need TikTok-style feed infrastructure as a core feature is an open question, not an established fact.

I'd watch this one closely but not write a check today. The specific knowledge credential is among the strongest I've seen at pre-seed -- genuinely rare, genuinely non-teachable. But the leverage architecture is incremental rather than transformative, the timing is consensus-riding rather than contrarian, and the incumbent risk from Mux is structural, not hypothetical. The company needs to prove that the market for standalone short-form video infrastructure is real and large, and that the vertical specialization creates a durable gap that horizontal platforms can't close. Those are execution questions, not knowledge questions -- and at pre-seed, the knowledge is what I'm paying for.
