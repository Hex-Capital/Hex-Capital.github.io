# CodeWisp -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing I noticed about CodeWisp isn't the founder or the product -- it's that this is one of the most crowded, consensus-driven categories I've seen in a YC batch. AI-powered game creation is the hot thing right now. Moonlake AI just raised $28 million from Naval and Nvidia. Rosebud AI already has 2.1 million games created on its platform. YC itself flagged that a quarter of its W25 cohort had codebases that were 95%+ AI-generated. "Vibe coding" is practically a meme. When I look at an opportunity, one of my strongest signals is that nobody else wants to touch it -- that the idea makes other investors uncomfortable or confused. CodeWisp triggers the opposite reaction in me. Everyone wants a piece of AI gaming right now, and that means the weirdness has already been priced in. There's no contrarian edge here. The deal flow is flowing in this direction, which is precisely when I start looking the other direction.

Now, Elvin Fu clearly knows this space. Making games since he was ten, building two engines from scratch, teaching 22 million people game development, ranked in the Top 20 on Scratch among 135 million users -- that's genuine, earned domain expertise. I respect it deeply. If I were sitting across from him, I'd want to hear his story, and I suspect what I'd hear is a young person who found their calling early and pursued it with real dedication. That matters. But when I evaluate founders, I'm listening for something specific -- the hardship that fused them to this problem so completely that walking away isn't an option. I'm listening for the thing that broke them and rebuilt them. Travis Kalanick had a kind of gravitas that came from years of fighting impossible battles. The Contraline founder spent years in academic obscurity pursuing an idea the world didn't want. What I see with Elvin is passion and skill, but not the biographical forge that tells me this person will survive the inevitable crisis when Moonlake raises their Series A at fifty million and Rosebud hits ten million games. Passion is fuel, but grit forged through adversity is the engine.

The strongest bull case here is distribution. Elvin's audience -- 65K YouTube subscribers, Top 20 on Scratch, years of credibility with beginner game developers -- is a genuine warm-start advantage that money can't easily buy. If CodeWisp can convert even a fraction of that audience into a sticky community of creators and players, the platform effects could compound in ways that matter. The educational layer (structured courses, block editor) combined with the community showcase and leaderboards is a smart architectural bet -- it's trying to build something that looks more like Roblox's ecosystem than a bare-bones text-to-game generator. If the community reaches critical mass before the better-funded competitors figure out that community is the actual moat, not the AI layer, CodeWisp could win despite being outspent. That's a real scenario, and I don't want to dismiss it.

But I keep coming back to the structural problems through my lens. This company doesn't create economic access for underserved populations in any direct way I can identify. It doesn't make an invisible system visible or transparent. It doesn't operate in a regulated or stigmatized space where complexity creates natural barriers to competition. It's a consumer creative tool in a category where the generation technology itself is rapidly commoditizing -- the LLMs that power the code generation are improving for everyone simultaneously, which means the core technical layer isn't proprietary. The moat has to come from community, and community moats take time to build while well-capitalized competitors are racing to build the same thing. I also can't evaluate team resilience here -- only one founder is listed despite a team of three, which means the co-founder dynamics that I now consider essential to assess after the HQ Trivia experience are simply invisible to me. Solo-founder risk is real, especially when the distribution strategy is so tightly coupled to one person's personal brand.

This is a competent founder building a reasonable product in a market that's going to be large. I don't doubt that. But it doesn't match the pattern of investments where I've generated my best returns. My best bets have been on misfits solving problems in spaces nobody else wanted to enter -- not talented people entering crowded races where the incumbents are already well-armed. I'd wish Elvin well and tell him I'm not the right investor for this particular journey.
