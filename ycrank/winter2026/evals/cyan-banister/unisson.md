# Unisson -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Unisson: this is an AI agent company building for customer success teams at a moment when *every* investor and their LP is chasing AI agents for enterprise. Gainsight already acquired Staircase AI. ChurnZero launched AI Agents. Vitally is branding itself an AI copilot. Coworker.ai just raised $16.5 million. When I look at an opportunity, I'm asking myself -- is this unpopular? Is it difficult to assess? Does it have real technology risk that isn't insurmountable? Unisson might hit that third criterion, but the first two are a hard no. This is one of the most consensus categories in all of tech right now. The idea of putting an AI agent inside Slack to help customer success teams is exactly what every accelerator demo day audience expects to see in 2026. That's not where I find my best investments. My best investments -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- were ideas that made people uncomfortable. Nobody's uncomfortable with this.

The founder question is where I always start, and here I'm left reaching for something to hold onto. Varun Mathur rose through Ambient.ai from software engineer to leading product, engineering, and VLM research for their agent products -- at a company backed by a16z with $72 million raised. Tom Achache led perception systems at Chef Robotics, managing production robot deployments. These are genuinely strong technical credentials for building reliable AI agents. I respect that. But when I ask my foundational question -- tell me your story, not the business -- I can't find the thread that connects these founders to *this specific problem*. Why customer success? Why the product knowledge gap in post-sales teams? Did Varun watch customer success teams drown at Ambient.ai? Did Tom experience some formative frustration with enterprise support? There's nothing in the record that tells me this problem lives in their bones. It looks more like two capable engineers who identified a well-defined market opportunity within their skillset. That's a fine way to start a company, but it's not how I identify the founders who will persist through the inevitable crises when everything breaks.

The strongest bull case here is real, and I want to name it honestly: if the product-learning mechanism genuinely works -- if an AI agent can understand any product in 15-20 minutes well enough to handle custom integrations, onboarding, and health audits -- that's a meaningful technical achievement. The incumbents face a structural tension: their existing products help CSMs do their jobs, while autonomous agents partially automate those jobs. That channel conflict could create a genuine opening for a startup without legacy customer relationships to protect. And the narrow focus on technical CS, implementation, and sales engineering is a smart wedge -- these roles require deeper product knowledge than general customer success, which means a more defensible product if it works. Varun's specific experience building VLM-powered agent products gives him an edge that most AI founders in this space don't have.

But I keep coming back to what's missing for me. There's no signal of economic access or real-world impact for underserved populations -- this helps enterprise SaaS companies deploy their products more efficiently, which is valuable but doesn't create the kind of positive-sum outcomes I saw in Uber, Postmates, or Affirm. There's no regulatory or stigma moat -- anyone with access to foundation models and RAG infrastructure can attempt this, and many are. The "Unisson" brand faces a search disambiguation problem against UNISON the UK trade union and multiple other entities, which is a small thing but tells me something about how carefully the founders thought about their go-to-market. And I have zero visibility into the co-founder dynamic -- no shared history, no signal about how these two people found each other or how they navigate disagreement. After HQ Trivia, I always want to understand that fabric before I write a check.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a crowded, hot market. That's the opposite of my investment pattern. I'm looking for the dreamers and weirdos building something that makes everyone else say no. Unisson makes everyone say yes -- and that's exactly why it's not my bet.
