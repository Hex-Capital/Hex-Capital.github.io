# Caretta -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with Caretta: this is AI for sales calls. That's one of the most competed, most consensus categories in the entire YC ecosystem right now. When I see Gong with $584 million raised and a quarter-billion in ARR, Cresta at $282 million, Balto at $52 million — and then I look at the founding team's public GitHub repo, which is a FastAPI wrapper around NVIDIA's off-the-shelf Parakeet model — I don't get that jolt. I get the opposite. The most promising companies are the ones nobody else wants to fund because they sound insane. This is the kind of company that every AI-focused fund in the Valley is chasing right now. When everybody's excited, I've learned that's exactly when I should be somewhere else.

If I could sit down with Kayra, Omar, and Pavlos, my first question would be the same one I ask every founder: tell me your story. Not the business — how did you get here? And from what I can see in the dossier, the answer is three computer science students from TU Delft who built Discord bots, launched a recruitment screening tool called VoysAI in April 2025, and then pivoted to live sales call AI within a few months. There's nothing wrong with that — they're clearly capable engineers. But I don't see the biographical thread that makes them the inevitable people to solve this problem. Nobody on this team appears to have worked in B2B sales, run a sales floor, or personally experienced the pain of fumbling a deal because they couldn't pull up the right objection handler in time. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research on male contraception before anyone would write him a check — the problem was in his bones. When I found Uber, it was because I'd spent years talking with my husband about the taxi medallion racket. The founders who persist through the brutal middle years are the ones whose identity is fused to the problem. I can't find that fusion here, and it's the first thing I look for.

The bull case deserves real engagement, because there is a legitimate technical timing argument. Real-time inference during a live call is a fundamentally different architecture than recording a call and analyzing it afterward. Gong's entire platform, its sales motion, its customer expectations — all of it was built around post-call analytics. Pivoting to real-time could cannibalize their existing value proposition and confuse their messaging. There's a window where a fast, focused team could own the "during the call" moment before incumbents catch up. And the per-customer knowledge base that compounds with every call does create genuine switching costs over time. If the Caretta team could land ten serious enterprise customers in the next twelve months and accumulate enough organizational intelligence that those customers couldn't leave, they'd have something defensible. That's the path. But it requires a team that deeply understands enterprise sales cycles, and I don't see evidence of that domain fluency yet.

What I uniquely notice is what's missing from an impact perspective. The companies I'm most drawn to create economic access for people who lack it — Uber created income for drivers, Postmates for delivery workers, Affirm gave transparent credit to people shut out by traditional finance. Caretta helps already-employed B2B sales reps close deals more efficiently. That's useful, but it doesn't unlock opportunity for anyone who's currently excluded. It doesn't make an invisible system visible or transparent. It's an optimization tool for knowledge workers who are already inside the system. That doesn't disqualify it as a business, but it means my gut isn't pulling me forward the way it does with companies that are reshaping who gets access to what.

Three university co-founders who've built together since at least early 2025 and already navigated a pivot is a real signal — I learned from HQ Trivia that co-founder dynamics matter more than timing, and these three have at least been tested once. But the pivot itself gives me pause. Moving from recruitment screening to live sales AI in under a year doesn't read like deepening conviction — it reads like searching for product-market fit in whatever direction gets traction. The best founders I've backed couldn't have pivoted away from their problem if they tried, because the problem was personal. I want founders who are solving something they can't stop thinking about, not founders who are talented engineers looking for the right application of their skills.

I'll pass on this one. Smart team, real technical capability, but it doesn't match the pattern I've spent a decade learning to trust. The category is too consensus, the founder-problem connection is too thin, and the commoditization risk on the underlying tech stack is too real. For this to work as an investment I'd want to make, I'd need to hear the story I haven't heard yet — the one where one of these founders has a reason they can't walk away from this specific problem, even when Gong starts shipping real-time features and the window narrows.
