# Pax Historia -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Pax Historia isn't the product or the AI architecture -- it's the traction. Thirty-five thousand daily active users in four months with no paid acquisition, community wikis springing up organically, someone on Hacker News building an autonomous agent just to play the game. That's real user love, the kind of signal you can't manufacture. When I saw how AI Dungeon hit 1.5 million monthly users and then faded, I wondered whether AI-generated gameplay was a novelty or a category. Pax Historia's community formation -- the 4,000+ presets, the creator commissions, the subreddit, the Discord -- suggests something stickier. The UGC flywheel reminds me a little of what made early YouTube defensible: the creators become the content engine, and the content attracts the audience, and the audience attracts more creators. That's a real dynamic and I don't want to dismiss it.

But here's where my process diverges from most investors. Before I look at the product or the market, I want to hear the founder's story -- not the business, the person. And with Pax Historia, I'm reaching for that thread and coming up mostly empty. Eli Bullock-Papa is an engineering student at Virginia Tech with experience at Capital One and Olive Garden. Ryan Zhang's entire YC biography is three words: "I like history." I don't know what drove these founders to this specific problem. I don't know what hardship they've navigated. I don't know if they've ever been told no fifty times and kept building anyway. They may have extraordinary stories I simply can't access from public data -- and if I were sitting across from them, I'd ask. But the biographical signal that anchors my entire evaluation method is absent here, and that's a significant gap for how I invest. The founders who persist through the inevitable crises of building a company are, in my experience, the ones whose personal identity is fused with the mission. "I like history" is an interest, not a calling.

The product itself occupies a genuine gap in the market -- it sits between Paradox Interactive's deep but scripted grand strategy and AI Dungeon's purely textual adventures, and nobody else has planted a flag there. That's interesting. But I keep asking myself: is this the kind of opportunity that's unpopular and hard to assess, or is it the kind that's popular and easy to get excited about? AI-powered gaming is very much a hot category right now. The YC launch got amplified by YC's own account, a tech creator's tweet pulled 140K views, Kotaku listed it. This doesn't feel like a company that's been rejected by fifty investors -- it feels like one that's riding a wave. The structural insight that Paradox would have to cannibalize their DLC revenue model to compete is genuinely smart, and the specific combination of emergent AI narratives with map-based geopolitical simulation is novel. But I've learned to be cautious when a deal feels too easy to like. The most promising companies tend to make people uncomfortable, and I don't sense that discomfort here.

Let me give the bull case its full due, because I owe that to the traction these founders have generated. If Pax Historia becomes the platform for AI-generated interactive experiences -- not just grand strategy but any "what if" scenario across history, science fiction, fantasy -- the TAM expands dramatically. The creator economy layer is the real unlock: if preset creators can earn meaningful income by designing scenarios, Pax Historia becomes a marketplace where historical knowledge and creative design are monetizable skills. That's a version of the Thumbtack or Postmates thesis -- connecting people who have specialized knowledge with people who want to consume it -- applied to interactive entertainment. The 60% cost reduction through intelligent model routing suggests operational sophistication beyond what you'd expect from a college-age team, and if inference costs continue declining (which they likely will), the unit economics improve automatically. If these founders can convert even 5% of their 35K DAU into paying users with meaningful ARPU, this could be a real business. The community has already built the content library that would take a well-funded competitor years to replicate.

Where I ultimately land, though, is that my framework isn't built to evaluate this kind of opportunity at its best. I invest in founders whose biographies explain why they're the only people who could solve this specific problem, in spaces that are regulated or stigmatized enough to deter competitors, creating economic access for people who lack it. Pax Historia is a well-executed consumer gaming product in a trendy AI category, built by talented young founders whose personal connection to the mission I can't assess. The defensibility is real but network-based rather than regulatory -- and network effects in gaming are notoriously fragile when the next novel experience launches. The content moderation challenge ahead is serious but isn't the kind of regulatory complexity that creates a moat. I genuinely hope these founders succeed, and if I could sit down with them and hear the story behind the company, my conviction might shift. But based on what I can see, this doesn't pattern-match to the outsider-founder, anti-consensus, hard-space bets that define my portfolio.
