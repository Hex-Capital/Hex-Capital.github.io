# Orthogonal -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Orthogonal: everyone wants to be in this room. Coinbase and Cloudflare launched x402. Stripe and OpenAI shipped ACP. Google built AP2. Visa announced Intelligent Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay. Skyfire raised $9.5 million from a16z and Coinbase Ventures. And these are just the ones we know about. When I see that much capital and that many incumbents converging on a category simultaneously, my instinct is to walk the other direction. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- shared a quality that Orthogonal does not: nobody else wanted to be there. This is a crowded room where the biggest companies in fintech are already elbowing each other. The question isn't whether agent payments matter -- clearly they do -- it's whether a two-person pre-seed startup can build a durable aggregation layer above protocols being defined by Stripe and Coinbase. That's not the kind of technology risk I get excited about. That's execution risk against better-resourced competitors who are moving fast.

When I think about founders, I always start with the story -- not the resume. And what I see here are two very talented engineers from McGill with strong professional credentials. Christian built payments at Coinbase and billing at Vercel. Bera shipped APIs at Google -- reCAPTCHA and Maps -- and competed at the ICPC World Finals twice, which is genuinely impressive. They met at McGill and stayed close friends. All of that tells me they're smart and that they have relevant domain experience. But I don't hear the biographical thread that tells me *why this specific problem keeps them up at night.* The best founders I've backed were solving something that was deeply personal to them, something forged in real difficulty. Travis Kalanick didn't just see a market opportunity in transportation -- he had a kind of fury about it that you could feel. With Orthogonal, I see career adjacency: "I worked in payments, he worked in APIs, let's build something at the intersection." That's a perfectly rational starting point for a company, but it's not the signal that makes me write a first check from my own money.

To be fair, I want to sit with the bull case here, because it's not nothing. If MCP becomes the dominant standard for agent tool-calling -- and Anthropic has real momentum behind it -- then someone will own the aggregation layer above it. Orthogonal's single-key abstraction is a clean developer experience, and the Carta analogy is tempting: Carta turned opaque cap table management into a transparent platform, and the first mover with the best integration density won. If Orthogonal can get to 200+ high-quality API integrations before anyone else builds a comparable marketplace, the switching costs compound. Developers who've wired their agent workflows through one Orthogonal key don't want to reconfigure thirty individual API accounts. And Christian's Coinbase payments background combined with Bera's API infrastructure experience at Google is about as on-the-nose as founder-market fit gets for this particular problem. The pay-per-call model is also elegant -- no subscriptions, pure usage-based, which aligns naturally with how agents consume APIs. I can see the version of this that works.

But the version that works requires winning a marketplace cold-start problem while Stripe, Coinbase, and Google are building the rails underneath you and could decide to add a discovery layer any Tuesday. And the impact dimension just isn't there for me. Orthogonal makes life more convenient for developers who already have plenty of access and resources. It's not opening a door for anyone who was locked out. Compare that to Affirm making transparent credit available to people getting gouged by hidden fees, or Uber creating income streams for people who just needed a car and a phone. When I invest, I'm looking for companies where the world gets meaningfully better for people who need it most. Developer API management is useful infrastructure, but it doesn't carry that weight.

The co-founder dynamic is probably the brightest signal from my framework. College friends who stayed close and then started a company together -- that's a foundation I've learned to respect. It's not the same as family, but a years-long friendship that survived into professional co-founding suggests they've navigated disagreements before. I'd want to probe how they make decisions when they disagree, especially because a two-person team has nowhere to hide from conflict. But the friendship baseline is a positive indicator, and I won't discount it.

Ultimately, this is a well-assembled team chasing a real market with a clean product -- and it's not my kind of bet. It's popular. It's easy to assess. And it doesn't create the kind of access or transparency that pulls me forward. I'd tell Christian and Bera they're talented and the timing is interesting, and I'd mean it. But my money goes to the founders building in places where nobody else wants to be, solving problems that won't let them sleep because of something in their own story. I'm not feeling the jolt here.
