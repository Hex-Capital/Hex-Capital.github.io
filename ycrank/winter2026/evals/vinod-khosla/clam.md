# Clam -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is what jumps out immediately: three well-funded AI security companies -- Protect AI, Lakera, CalypsoAI -- were all acquired by major cybersecurity incumbents within months of each other in 2025, for a combined $680M+. On the surface, this looks like a market-clearing event that opens the field for a new entrant. But look closer and the signal inverts. Palo Alto Networks, Check Point, and F5 didn't acquire these companies to shelve the technology -- they acquired them to integrate AI security into platform products that already sit in every enterprise's stack. Clam isn't competing against scrappy startups anymore. It's competing against the three largest cybersecurity platforms on earth, each of which just absorbed a dedicated AI security team. That's not an open field. That's a minefield.

Let me start where I always start: if Clam succeeds completely, what happens? Enterprises deploy AI agents more safely. That's the entire consequence. Clam doesn't transform how any industry operates -- it wraps a security layer around someone else's transformation. The company's own framing tells you everything: "Run OpenClaw Securely in Minutes." The ambition is to be a checkpoint, not a destination. I've seen this pattern hundreds of times -- talented engineers building infrastructure tooling that makes an existing process incrementally safer or faster. The technology works, the market exists, the problem is real. And the consequence of success is a decent business in a category where Palo Alto Networks has already written a $500M check to own the space. Nobody's life changes. No industry gets remade. The founders have narrowed their scope to the point where even wild success means a security feature, not a security company.

The technology itself reinforces this concern. PII scanning, prompt injection detection, malicious code detection -- every one of these capabilities exists as open-source libraries or cloud APIs today. Lakera Guard offers prompt injection detection for free. NVIDIA's NeMo Guardrails is open source. The dossier itself acknowledges that "the network-level wrapping approach is architecturally straightforward for cybersecurity teams to replicate." When I backed Juniper, Pradeep Sindhu was building a fundamentally different routing architecture that made Cisco's approach structurally obsolete. Clam is assembling existing components into a wrapper. That's systems integration, not technology disruption. There is no moment where the incumbent approach becomes uneconomic because Clam exists.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. Agentic AI represents a new attack surface category that didn't exist eighteen months ago. The shift from chatbots with limited tool access to autonomous agents executing code, browsing the web, and calling APIs is a real security threshold. If agentic AI adoption follows an exponential curve -- and the trajectory suggests it will -- every enterprise deploying these agents needs security infrastructure they don't have today. Clam's founders come from exactly the right places: Anshul built AI evaluation infrastructure at HappyRobot, Vaibhav worked on agent orchestration and containerization at Augment Code. They've lived inside the problem. If Clam could become the default security substrate for all agentic AI -- not just OpenClaw but every framework -- and if they could accumulate proprietary threat data that creates a compounding advantage, this could be a meaningful infrastructure company. The timing is legitimately strong, and I don't dismiss that.

But here's what I notice that a generic analyst would miss: the founders are insiders executing the industry's own playbook. Two UC Berkeley engineers who worked at AI agent companies, building a security product for AI agents. They met in a Computer Security course. This is the archetype I warn against -- people who know what the industry considers possible and build within those boundaries. Where is the irreverence? Where is the contrarian thesis that experts dismiss? AI agent security is a consensus opportunity -- everyone in the YC ecosystem knows agents need guardrails. When Cisco's CTO told me TCP/IP routing was impossible, that was my signal to invest in Juniper. Nobody is telling Clam that AI agent security is unnecessary. The absence of dismissal is itself a warning: if the experts agree you're right, you're probably building something incremental enough that incumbents will absorb it. And the platform dependency on OpenClaw adds fragility -- if OpenClaw ships native security features or loses to a competing framework, Clam's positioning collapses. You cannot build a category-defining company on someone else's platform without owning the relationship with the end user.

The honest assessment: Clam is a well-timed, competently founded company solving a real problem. But it has reduced its probability of failure by choosing a narrow, validated niche with available technology and consensus demand. That's exactly the trade I refuse to make. The consequence of success doesn't justify my interest at the scale I invest for.
