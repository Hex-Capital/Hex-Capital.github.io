# Hlabs -- Paul Graham Evaluation

Paul Hetherington ran Mystic AI through YC W21 for six years, watched it wind down, and came back to start something completely different. That pattern grabs my attention. When Emmett Shear's Kiko died after Google Calendar launched, we funded him again, and Justin.tv became Twitch. The interesting question is whether Hetherington's failure taught him something that makes HLabs work -- or whether the jump from ML deployment infrastructure to physical robotics hardware is too large a pivot for the learning to transfer. The evidence suggests the jump is actually a return. His degree is in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. He researched UAV control systems and embedded hardware before Mystic. He didn't pivot away from his core competence -- he spent six years on a detour and came home.

The schlep here is genuine and enormous. Building a domestic supply chain for robotics actuator components means dealing with PCB manufacturing, component sourcing, quality control, inventory management, shipping logistics, defense procurement compliance, and ITAR regulations. It's the robotics equivalent of what the Collisons faced walking into banks -- obvious problem, ugly work, everyone looks away. Thousands of robotics startups know their component supply chain is fragmented and China-dependent. The 145% tariffs made the pain acute, but the structural problem predated the tariffs: early-stage robot builders have always been stuck assembling their own actuator stacks from mismatched overseas parts. That's the kind of schlep that keeps a market unsolved. The concern is whether Hetherington found this problem through lived experience or through reading about tariffs. His engineering background and embedded systems research suggest genuine domain connection, but he spent six years in a different world. The origin story isn't as clean as "I kept forgetting my USB drive." It's more like "I trained as the right kind of engineer, went and did something else, then the tariff moment made me realize I should build what my training always pointed toward." That's partially organic, which is better than manufactured but not as strong as a founder who's been living with this specific pain for years.

What I find compelling is that he's actually building the product himself. His Twitter shows PCB layouts, motor calibration data, firmware debugging -- this isn't a founder managing engineers, this is an engineer making things. The ACB v2.0 shipped at $35 per unit with open-source firmware and control libraries. That combination -- low price point, open-source software, hardware you can hold -- is a picks-and-shovels play for robot builders. It's the kind of product I evaluate partly through the lens of "would I want to use this if I were building a robot?" The answer is obviously yes. The open-source firmware functions exactly like Stripe's developer documentation did: make the integration experience so frictionless that switching costs emerge from familiarity rather than lock-in. Forty-plus robotics companies placing orders within four months of the October 2025 launch is a real signal. These aren't consumers buying on impulse -- these are engineering teams integrating a component into their robot designs, which means they evaluated it technically before committing.

The bull case is that HLabs becomes the Stripe of robotics components: start with one product (actuator control boards, like Stripe started with payment processing), nail the developer experience, then expand horizontally into main boards, cameras, wireless modules -- the full stack. The tariffs provide an initial catalyst, but the real moat would be an integrated ecosystem of components designed to work together, manufactured domestically, with defense-grade supply chain provenance. If Hetherington executes on the Q1 2026 roadmap -- Nvidia Jetson main board, camera system, wireless module -- you'd have four product lines creating genuine switching costs. The market timing is favorable: $2.26 billion in robotics startup funding in Q1 2026, CHIPS Act reshoring incentives, and structural demand for domestic components from defense customers who can't buy Chinese regardless of tariffs.

The thing that concerns me most is that he's one person trying to build a hardware supply chain. I made Drew Houston find a co-founder before we'd accept Dropbox, and Dropbox was software. Hardware is a different animal. You can't push firmware updates to fix manufacturing defects. You can't iterate on supply chain relationships the way you iterate on code. The plan to ship four product lines in Q1 2026 with a team of one is either a sign of extraordinary ambition or a plan that hasn't been stress-tested against reality. Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate, and building physical products alone -- simultaneously designing PCBs, writing firmware, managing manufacturing, handling customer support, and running sales -- is asking for an execution bottleneck that determination alone can't solve. The tariff dependency adds fragility: build your business model on government policy, and you're one trade negotiation away from losing your cost advantage. The open-source firmware, while great for adoption, means the software moat is zero -- defensibility has to come entirely from hardware manufacturing and supply chain execution, which are capital-intensive and slow to build.

I'd write a small check here, primarily because the schlep is real, the technical founder clearly builds his own product, and the repeat YC founder pattern has worked for me before. But the solo founder risk on hardware keeps this from being a confident bet. If Hetherington finds the right co-founder -- someone who complements his engineering with manufacturing operations or sales -- this moves substantially up my conviction scale. Right now it's a bet on one exceptionally capable person tackling a genuinely hard problem that others avoid. That's often enough. Sometimes it isn't.
