# Axis -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I look at is what the founders know that can't be taught. Eric Zhu has a math degree from UChicago and a quantitative trading internship at TransMarket Group. Ian Wang graduated from Yale in 2025 and is described on the YC page as "interested in trading." An internship and an interest. That's not specific knowledge — that's a resume line and a hobby. TransMarket Group is a derivatives prop trading firm. Physical commodities trading — the actual movement and storage of crude oil, copper, and grain across the globe — is a fundamentally different domain. The gap between trading financial derivatives and understanding why a refinery in Rotterdam is running at reduced capacity and what that means for European diesel crack spreads is enormous. Anyone smart enough to get into UChicago and Yale could identify that commodity traders use fragmented data sources. That observation is available to any consultant who spends a quarter in the industry. Where is the knowledge that took years to accumulate, that a competitor couldn't replicate with six months of research and a few industry hires?

The leverage architecture reveals the structural problem more precisely. Axis is building custom AI models for individual trading desks — a model-deployment layer configured per client. But the customer universe is a handful of physical trading houses (Vitol, Trafigura, Glencore, maybe twenty more), commodity desks at major banks, and specialized hedge funds. This is not Replit, where one engineer's work serves millions of aspiring programmers. This is bespoke enterprise tooling for a concentrated buyer pool, each with their own internal quant teams already building proprietary models. Every major commodities trading house employs quantitative researchers who do exactly what Axis proposes to sell. The leverage ratio — output per unit of input — is constrained by the need for deep customization per client and the fact that each trading desk's strategy is proprietary and deliberately differentiated from competitors. You're not building a protocol; you're building a service that looks like software.

The competitive landscape is the loudest signal in this dossier. Kpler has raised $441 million, runs $100 million in ARR, and has been acquiring companies aggressively — ChartDesk, Spire Maritime, Bridgeton Research Group, all in 2024-2025. Vortexa has $64 million in funding and Morgan Stanley's expansion capital behind it. Kayrros has $84 million and doubled revenue to $20 million in a year. These are not sleepy incumbents waiting to be disrupted. They are well-funded, AI-capable analytics platforms actively expanding their capabilities. The core concept — applying AI models to monitor commodities data — does not require proprietary technology. The memo itself notes this explicitly. When Kpler decides to offer customizable model deployment, and they will, what does Axis have that Kpler doesn't? Not the data access (which depends on expensive proprietary feeds from Argus and Platts that a pre-seed company will struggle to afford). Not the customer relationships. Not the technical compounding. This is consensus meets incumbency — the opposite of the asymmetric setup I look for.

The strongest bull case would require two things to be true simultaneously. First, that the declining cost of LLM inference creates a genuine architectural shift — that custom model deployment for each trader becomes so cheap that it represents a new category, the way Notion created "personal productivity infrastructure" that didn't exist before. If Axis could build a platform where each trader's monitoring configuration creates data that improves the platform for every other user, there's a compounding network effect in the model layer that Kpler's traditional analytics pipeline can't replicate. Second, that these founders, despite thin domain credentials today, have the kind of obsessive curiosity about market microstructure that produces deep specific knowledge over the next two years. Their shared thesis that "models would enable a new paradigm for how we interact with markets" gestures at a genuine insight about the transition from static data feeds to dynamic model-driven monitoring. But gesturing at an insight and possessing the non-teachable knowledge to execute on it are different things entirely. I'd need to see that they've built something — a working prototype that a real trader has used — and I see no evidence of that. No GitHub repos, no visible product on their website, no traction signals of any kind.

Two additional concerns from my framework. I require a technologist on the founding team — someone who has built the core product themselves. Neither founder has visible technical output. No public repositories, no prior technical projects, no demonstration that either of them can build the system they're describing. The YC page lists no open positions, so they aren't hiring engineers either. In the technology business, you need a builder. And the data sourcing dependency is a structural trap: the most valuable commodity data — Argus assessments, Platts benchmarks, proprietary flow data — is controlled by incumbents who have no incentive to provide it cheaply to a potential competitor. You can't build a model-deployment platform without data to feed the models.

This is a pass. Smart students in a real market, but with insufficient specific knowledge, no visible technical product, a leverage architecture that's constrained by customer concentration, and a competitive landscape that actively works against them. The founders may develop deep domain expertise over time, but I invest in knowledge that already exists, not knowledge that might develop. I want to back people who have been obsessing over this problem for years and know something the market doesn't. A quant trading internship and an interest in trading don't clear that bar.
