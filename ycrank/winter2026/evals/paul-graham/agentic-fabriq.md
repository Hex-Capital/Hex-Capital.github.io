# Agentic Fabriq -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The most striking thing about Agentic Fabriq is what's missing from the problem it's attacking: schlep blindness. When the Collisons started Stripe, thousands of programmers knew payment processing was broken, but nobody wanted to walk into the banks. The problem was obvious and the avoidance was unconscious. Agent permissions is the opposite case. Oasis has raised $75M. Astrix has raised $85M. CrowdStrike just paid $740M for SGNL. Okta shipped Auth for GenAI and announced the XAA protocol months before this company launched. Everyone can see this problem, and everyone with capital is already running at it. When a problem has attracted $200M+ in dedicated startup funding and the dominant incumbent is actively building its own solution, you're not in schlep blindness territory. You're in a land rush. And land rushes favor the well-capitalized, not two-person teams with $500K.

The idea itself has the telltale shape of something manufactured from market analysis rather than stumbled into through experience. "Okta for Agents" is an analogy, not a discovery. The founders are MIT AI researchers whose work spans astronomy, computational biology, and economics -- interesting backgrounds, but none of them obviously lead you to the specific pain of enterprise agent permission scoping. When I ask myself "how did they find this problem?" the most plausible answer is they read about the explosion of AI agents in enterprise and identified a gap in the IAM stack. That's exactly the process I've warned about. Smart people brainstorming startup ideas will often converge on whatever's trending. In 2025-2026, if you sit down and ask "what do enterprises need for AI agents?", security and permissions is an obvious answer. Which means everyone else arrived at the same answer too.

To be fair, the bull case here is real and worth articulating. If Okta's architecture is fundamentally built around human-to-app SSO, then retrofitting it for per-employee agent delegation might be as awkward as retrofitting Yahoo for social networking. Purpose-built solutions sometimes destroy incumbents precisely because the incumbents can't reorganize their data model fast enough. And the timing window is genuinely narrow -- enterprise agent adoption is going from 5% to 40% of applications in roughly a year, which means whoever establishes the permissions standard during this transition has a chance at becoming infrastructure. If the founders' AI research backgrounds give them deeper understanding of how agents actually consume tools than security-focused competitors have, that could be a meaningful edge. The switching costs once an enterprise configures per-employee policies and audit logs across dozens of tool connectors would be substantial. That's a company worth building. But I need to see evidence that *these* founders, with *this* background, have some insight into this specific problem that the teams at Oasis with $75M don't have. And I don't see it.

The founders show determination -- dropping out of MIT at 19 takes nerve. Their co-founder relationship predates the company, which avoids one of my biggest red flags. But determination without domain context produces founders who plow through walls that shouldn't be there. Enterprise security sales to IT administrators and CISOs is a specific skill. Building and maintaining dozens of SaaS tool connectors is a specific grind. Navigating SOC 2 compliance and enterprise procurement cycles is a specific schlep. Nothing in the dossier suggests these founders have lived any of that. Their research backgrounds at Kavli, Haystack, and CSAIL are impressive but orthogonal. And the absence of any public GitHub repos or evidence of a working prototype is concerning for what should be a deeply technical infrastructure product.

No users, no revenue, no named pilots, no waitlist. For a pre-seed company that's normal. But for a company positioning itself against Okta's existing enterprise distribution and Oasis's $75M war chest, the absence of even one enterprise design partner to point to is a problem. Enterprise security buyers don't adopt unproven tools from unknown startups without extraordinary trust signals. YC helps, but it's not enough when the alternative is adding Okta's agent features to an existing Okta contract. The path from here to meaningful enterprise adoption requires the founders to essentially out-execute teams with 10-100x their resources in a market those teams are specifically targeting. That's not impossible, but the dossier gives me nothing to suggest they have the specific advantages needed to do it.

This is a Pass. The idea is real but consensus. The market is hot but crowded. The founders are smart but lack visible connection to the specific problem they're solving. When I look at the companies that succeeded from positions like this, they had something unmistakable -- Stripe had the Collisons' programming taste and the willingness to deal with banks, Airbnb had founders who literally couldn't pay rent. Here I see two talented researchers who identified a trending market need and built a reasonable product concept around it. That's not enough when you're the smallest team in a room full of well-funded competitors all building the same thing.
