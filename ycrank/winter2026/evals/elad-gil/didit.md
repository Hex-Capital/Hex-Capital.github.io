# Didit -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Didit is the traction relative to capital deployed: 700+ active B2B customers, 300%+ net revenue retention at month 6, and approaching profitability -- all on $2M raised. A team of 12 competing against Persona ($418M raised), Veriff ($200M raised), and Onfido (acquired for $650M). That capital efficiency is a genuine execution signal. But execution velocity and market structure are different questions, and the market structure here is what gives me pause.

Identity verification is not a non-obvious market. It's a $14 billion category with clear incumbents, established Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders, and a well-understood growth trajectory. When I see TAM slides citing MarketsandMarkets projections, that tells me every investor already knows this market exists. The "why now" argument -- deepfakes are getting better, regulations are expanding, AI inference costs are dropping -- is real but incremental. These are tailwinds within an established category, not a structural inflection that unlocks a new market. Compare this to Coinbase in 2012, where the crypto infrastructure market didn't exist yet and most investors thought it was nonsensical. Or PagerDuty, where operations alerting was dismissed as a feature, not a company. Didit is entering a market where four companies have already raised a combined $800M+ and one has been acquired for $650M. The structural moment isn't "this market is now possible" -- it's "this market can now be served at lower cost." That's a valid business thesis, but it's a different category of opportunity.

Where Didit gets interesting is the product-to-distribution trajectory. The free-tier model -- 500 core KYC checks per month at zero cost, with paid expansion into AML screening, biometric auth, proof of address, and age estimation -- mirrors the Stripe playbook of using a simple API integration as the distribution wedge for an expanding product suite. The 300%+ NRR at month 6 is the most compelling data point in the dossier: it suggests customers are entering through core KYC and pulling additional verification products through the same integration. That's the distribution flywheel working. The incumbents face a genuine innovator's dilemma here -- Sumsub can't offer free core KYC without cannibalizing its $1.35/verification pricing on existing contracts. If Didit captures the SMB long tail that incumbents find unprofitable to serve, and those SMBs grow into mid-market companies, the distribution channel compounds. This is the strongest structural argument for the business.

The pivot from Gamium -- a blockchain/metaverse venture with a crypto token -- to B2B SaaS KYC is a mixed signal. On one hand, founders who were doing Web3 identity in 2021 and are now building enterprise compliance software could be chasing whatever market is getting funded. That pattern maps to what I've written about late-cycle diversification, where founders enter sectors without deep domain conviction. On the other hand, the domain thread is continuous: they were working on digital identity within Gamium and pivoted the delivery mechanism while keeping the problem space. And the speed of execution since the pivot -- V1 in August 2024, 700+ active customers by late 2025 -- suggests they found genuine product-market fit, not just a new pitch narrative. The Gamium token still existing on CoinMarketCap is a real enterprise sales liability though. Regulated financial institutions doing KYC vendor due diligence will find the crypto origins, and that creates friction in exactly the market segment where the largest contracts live.

The core technology risk is what keeps this in neutral territory for me. OCR, face matching, and liveness detection are increasingly commoditized -- available through open-source models and cloud AI services. Didit's differentiation is pricing and integration speed, not proprietary technology. When I apply the software-driven versus software-aware test, I'm not convinced the technology itself compounds in a way that creates durable defensibility. Pricing advantages can be matched -- it just requires a competitor willing to subsidize. Integration speed advantages erode as incumbents modernize their APIs. The 14,000+ document types across 220+ countries is a real data asset, but Veriff claims 10,000+ document types already. The single miracle here isn't clearly defined: is it achieving free-tier unit economics that work at scale? Winning enough SMBs to build distribution before incumbents respond? Maintaining compliance certifications across geographies with a 12-person team? When I can't name the one miracle in one sentence, that's usually because the plan requires several things to go right simultaneously.

The bull case I'd need to believe: Didit is the Gusto of identity verification -- a "boring but critical" infrastructure product that captures the underserved SMB long tail through radically simpler pricing and integration, then expands into a full platform as those customers grow. The NRR data supports this narrative. If the free tier drives conversion rates above 15-20%, and SMB customers grow into mid-market contracts, the distribution channel could compound faster than incumbents can respond. The GSMA Open Gateway partnership with Orange suggests the team is thinking about distribution channels beyond self-serve. And close-to-profitability on $2M means they won't need to raise venture capital at terms that require a $5B+ outcome -- they could build a highly profitable, capital-efficient business. But I'd need to see evidence that the technology moat deepens over time rather than narrowing as AI costs fall for everyone, and I'd need more confidence that the pivot from Web3 reflects genuine domain conviction rather than market opportunism.
