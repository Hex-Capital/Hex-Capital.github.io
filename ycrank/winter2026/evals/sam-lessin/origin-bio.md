# Origin -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's the thing that jumped out at me immediately: Origin's pitch is that their AI model "outperforms Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome." That's not a selling point — that's a death sentence. When you define your competitive advantage as being slightly better than a model built by a company with functionally unlimited compute, the best-case scenario is that you stay ahead for eighteen months before they release the next version and you're irrelevant. This is the canonical case of building where the incumbents with distribution and resources will crush you. I made exactly this argument on CNBC — Apple, Google, Meta are better positioned to control the AI ecosystem than startups — and in biotech AI, DeepMind IS that incumbent. Origin is running a race where the other runner has infinite stamina and they're sprinting.

Remove the AI from Origin and what's left? Nothing. No physical infrastructure, no regulatory position, no customer relationships, no data at scale. This is the opposite of a "cherry on top" business — AI isn't enhancing an otherwise sound operation, AI IS the entire operation. My test is brutal here: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer is it literally would not exist. Compare this to Craftwork, where the painting crews and scheduling complexity create a moat that AI optimizes but can't replace. Origin has no operational layer. The software is the business, and we've seen how that movie ends — I learned that lesson with Birchbox, and I've been shouting it from rooftops since 2024.

The founders are clearly smart — Yash won an OpenCV competition and shipped an NFT marketplace, Malhar published in Nature Scientific Reports in high school and worked at Wadhwani AI. But smart ML generalists pivoting into regulatory genomics is not the "sane person, insane idea" combination I look for. The "sane" in my framework means deep, specific credibility in the exact domain of the startup. Brian Armstrong was a Coinbase-type person before Coinbase existed. Anatoly Yakovenko was a Qualcomm systems engineer building Solana — he understood the hardware-level constraints of distributed systems because he'd spent years inside them. Yash's background is computer vision and reinforcement learning. Malhar's biomedical research was disease modeling with actigraphy data, not regulatory genomics. They're proximate to the domain, not native to it. The advisory board (Kellis, Paulk, Bashir) provides genuine scientific credibility, but advisors don't build companies — founders do. And critically, the idea itself isn't insane. AI for drug discovery is one of the most consensus investment categories in 2026. Every VC wants in. When every investor considers an idea obvious rather than crazy, the non-consensus premium has been fully arbitraged away.

The strongest bull case centers on the proprietary dataset. If Origin genuinely builds "the largest proprietary dataset of synthetic regulatory sequences across diverse cell-states" and validates those sequences through wet-lab experiments with pharma partners, you get a compounding data flywheel where each partnership generates more validated sequences, making the model better, attracting more partners. That's the path to becoming a new primitive — a validated library of synthetic regulatory DNA that becomes infrastructure for every gene therapy program. Gene therapy is growing from $11 billion to $55 billion by 2034, and regulatory elements are a genuine bottleneck. If Origin owns the standard library of validated synthetic promoters and enhancers the way Dyno is trying to own capsid design for delivery, that's a real infrastructure position. The problem is none of this exists yet. The dataset is aspirational. The wet-lab validation hasn't happened. And Asimov, with $205 million in the bank, already offers tissue-specific promoter design as part of a broader platform and has pharma relationships. Origin is trying to build a data moat from zero while a competitor with 200x their capital is building the same thing as a feature.

The gene therapy market provides genuine narrative room — the story of "we design the expression control layer for every gene therapy" could theoretically expand as the market grows. But this narrative is bounded by the company's position as a component supplier, not a platform. And the academic open-source risk is severe — the Nature Genetics 2025 paper on generative AI for synthetic regulatory DNA shows that this exact capability is being published and shared freely. In my framework, you need both an infinity story AND a downside cushion. Origin has a plausible expansion narrative but zero economic cushion — no revenue, no partnerships, no LOIs, just "seeking partnerships." At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of traction harshly, but I need something — a signed LOI, a pilot, a letter from a pharma VP saying "we need this." There's nothing.

This is a pass. Smart founders, real market, structural logic that works against them. They're building where the moats dissolve fastest — pure AI capability in a domain where DeepMind and well-funded competitors are already operating. The aspiring pirate in me wants to see founders who are building something the big players can't replicate because it requires operational complexity, physical infrastructure, or deeply non-consensus conviction. Origin is building something the big players are already replicating.
