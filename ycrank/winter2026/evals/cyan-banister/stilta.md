# Stilta -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I noticed first about Stilta: the space they're entering is already crowded, already well-funded, and already popular. Solve Intelligence has $55 million and eight-figure ARR. DeepIP hit seven-figure ARR in seven months. Patlytics grew 20x in six months. When I see a category where multiple startups are raising tens of millions and scaling fast, that's not my signal -- that's the signal that consensus has already formed. The most promising companies are not popular. They are difficult to assess. "AI tools for patent attorneys" is neither of those things in early 2026. It's a category with its own dedicated TechCrunch beat at this point. Calling yourself "Cursor for patent attorneys" is the kind of analogy-driven positioning that tells me a company is drafting behind someone else's insight rather than arriving at their own. When Crusoe Energy started, nobody had a category for "turn waste gas into computation." When Uber started, "ride-sharing" wasn't a phrase. Stilta is entering a market that already has a name, a competitive map, and a set of incumbents that other investors are eagerly backing.

If I were sitting across from Oskar Block, I'd ask him what I always ask: tell me your story, not the business. And what I'd hear is McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, two bootstrapped sports betting startups, Swedish unicorns. That's a capable resume. But the question I'm really asking is -- why patent law? Why this specific problem? His Twitter handle is @blockenbetting. His domain expertise is in sports betting and economics. The CTO and Chief Architect come from QuantumBlack, McKinsey's AI division. The fourth co-founder consulted with CEOs at McKinsey. These are accomplished, polished people from elite institutions. But I'm looking for the biographical thread that makes a founder inseparable from their company's mission -- the way Travis Kalanick's intensity about transportation was palpable before Uber had a single car on the road, or how Contraline's founder spent years in academic research on male contraception because he was genuinely obsessed with that specific problem. I don't see that thread here. None of these founders are patent attorneys. None have documented experience in IP prosecution. This looks like a consulting-derived market opportunity, not a personal mission.

The bull case deserves genuine consideration. Patent work is genuinely hard and regulated -- the legal-grade auditability requirements create real barriers that casual AI wrappers can't meet, and malpractice exposure means firms won't adopt tools that aren't deeply trustworthy. The QuantumBlack experience is relevant here: deploying AI systems in high-stakes enterprise environments where outputs need to be auditable is exactly what McKinsey's AI division does. If Stilta can nail the trust layer -- source-backed, referenced, verifiable outputs -- that could become a real moat. The end-to-end workspace positioning, covering FTO analysis, monitoring, and strategy in one platform, is differentiated from competitors who each own a slice. And Oskar bootstrapped two companies to $1M+ ARR, which means he knows how to build something that generates revenue. If the "already live with leading firms" claim translates into real retention and expansion, and if the end-to-end approach proves stickier than point solutions, this team has the enterprise DNA to scale it. For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that the patent AI market is winner-take-most, that the workspace approach beats the point-solution approach, and that these founders can learn patent law deeply enough through customer collaboration to outbuild competitors who've had an 18-month head start.

But that's a lot of "ifs," and none of them are the kind of conviction I invest on. What I notice through my particular lens is that this company doesn't create economic access for anyone who lacks it today. Patent attorneys at top firms are among the highest-paid professionals in law. Making their workflow 60% faster is an efficiency gain for a privileged class, not an expansion of opportunity. Compare this to Uber, which created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers, or Affirm, which gave transparent credit to people locked out of traditional finance. Stilta makes an already-functioning system work faster. It doesn't make an invisible system visible or open doors for people who are currently excluded. That's a fine business -- plenty of B2B SaaS companies thrive serving well-resourced professionals -- but it's not the kind of investment that activates my conviction.

Four co-founders from the same organization is worth noting. The shared McKinsey and QuantumBlack culture means they have a common working language and likely have stress-tested their collaboration in high-pressure consulting environments. That's better than co-founders who met at a hackathon. But four is a lot of people to keep aligned through the long journey of a startup, and I've seen how even two co-founders with shared history can fracture under existential pressure. I don't have evidence of how they resolve disagreements, and I'd want to understand the equity split and decision-making hierarchy before getting comfortable.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a hot market. That's precisely the profile I pass on. I'm looking for misfits solving problems that emerged from their own scars, building things that look strange to everyone else. Stilta looks sensible to everyone -- and that's the problem.
