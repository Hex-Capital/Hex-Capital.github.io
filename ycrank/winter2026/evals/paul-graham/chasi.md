# Chasi -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Chasi is the vertical they chose. When smart engineers decide to build AI agents, they build them for software companies, for knowledge workers, for other people who look like them. Building AI sales agents for equipment dealers — people who rent cranes and excavators, whose idea of a tech stack is a telephone and a spreadsheet from 1984 — is the kind of opportunity most founders filter out before they're even conscious of filtering. That's not quite schlep blindness in the Stripe sense, where everyone knows the problem exists but avoids the regulatory pain. It's more like category blindness: the equipment dealer industry is simply invisible to the median YC applicant. There's something real in that invisibility. Trillion-dollar industries with sub-60% fleet utilization and phone-based sales processes don't stay broken because nobody's smart enough to fix them. They stay broken because nobody who could fix them is paying attention.

The question is how Akash and Sarman found this problem, and the answer is the most interesting thing about the company. They were both on the founding team at Axion Ray, an AI platform for industrial manufacturers that sold to Boeing, Cummins, Denso, Harley Davidson — and scaled from pre-seed to a $62M Series B. They spent years in conference rooms with industrial operations leaders, deploying AI into manufacturing workflows. Akash previously worked at TAFE, an Indian tractor manufacturer, doing powertrain R&D. These are not two engineers who read a report about the equipment industry and decided the TAM looked attractive. They were adjacent to this problem for years. Not living it — they weren't equipment dealers — but close enough that the pain would have been visible to them in a way it isn't visible to someone whose industrial experience is limited to reading about it. I'd call this "adjacent organic," which is weaker than Drew Houston forgetting his USB drive but considerably stronger than a brainstorming session.

The Axion Ray tenure tells me something else that matters. These founders already took a company from founding through a $62M raise. They know what it means to sell AI to industrial buyers who are skeptical of technology, who have 18-month procurement cycles, who need to see ROI in their language. Sarman built supply chain software as a founding engineer at Tesla. When I see them exhibiting at the AED Summit in Dallas and becoming an official Ambassador with Associated Equipment Distributors, I recognize the pattern — they're going to trade shows and building relationships in person, which is exactly how you sell to this kind of customer. That's doing things that don't scale, applied to an industry where it's the only way to start.

Here's what gives me pause. Strip away the vertical and what you have is "AI agent for sales automation," which is one of the most crowded categories in all of AI right now. I could name twenty companies building LLM-powered sales agents. The differentiator is equipment-specific domain knowledge — understanding rental versus purchase versus service workflows, equipment specifications, fleet scheduling logic. That knowledge is real and it takes time to build. But it's not the same kind of moat as Stripe's banking relationships or Airbnb's network effects. A well-funded horizontal AI agent platform could add an "equipment dealer" template in a quarter. Moab, which just raised $16M for the same customer base, could bolt on AI communication features. The domain knowledge advantage is genuine at this moment but structurally fragile. What would need to be true for this to work is that the integration complexity with legacy DMS systems — Texada, InTempo, and others — creates enough friction that being first and embedded matters more than being better-funded. If every dealer has a different tech stack and the integration work is genuinely painful, then the schlep of connecting to each one becomes the moat. That's a defensible outcome, but I don't see enough evidence yet that the integration layer is actually that hard.

The traction evidence is thin but not absent. They're "live across equipment businesses in US and Europe," with testimonials claiming 2+ hours saved per day and 15% improvement in quote-to-win rates. But the testimonials are attributed to generic titles rather than named customers, and I can't verify the revenue figures. For pre-seed, being live with real dealers is a meaningful signal — but the generic framing makes me uncertain whether "live" means deeply embedded or lightly piloted. I note that Sarman's CS degree from Waterloo and his Tesla founding engineer background give me confidence the product actually works technically, though the absence of any public code or technical artifacts means I'm taking that on faith based on credentials rather than demonstrated output.

The bull case is genuinely compelling: two founders who have already built and scaled an AI-for-industry company, attacking a massive underserved vertical with real pain, going to market the right way through industry relationships rather than cold outbound. If the integration moat proves real and the domain-specific data flywheel kicks in before horizontal platforms catch up, this could own the revenue layer for equipment dealers. The founding team's industrial AI track record is among the strongest I've seen for this kind of vertical play. But the AI agent commoditization wave is moving fast, Moab has $16M and overlapping ambitions, and I need more evidence that the equipment-specific knowledge creates durable differentiation rather than a temporary head start.
