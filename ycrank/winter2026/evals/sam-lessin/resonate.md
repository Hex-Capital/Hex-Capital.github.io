# Resonate -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is exactly the kind of company I've been writing essays about for two years, and not in a good way. Resonate is an AI-enhanced voice messaging app -- transcription, filler word removal, emotion detection, video generation -- built entirely on commodity APIs competing against WhatsApp's two billion users. Apply the simplest version of my framework: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? The answer isn't "it would be worse." The answer is it wouldn't exist at all. There is no business underneath the AI layer. No physical operations, no proprietary data corpus, no protocol, no installed base, no regulatory position. Craftwork without its painting crews is a website. Resonate without its AI features is... an empty chat app. The software IS the business, and that's the category getting destroyed fastest right now.

Sam Kaplan has real credentials -- Harvard CS, engineering manager at Brex during that company's explosive scaling from 80 to 1,000 people, a Facebook internship. He's technically competent. But competent-person-plus-obvious-idea is my least interesting combination. An AI-powered messaging app isn't insane in the way Coinbase was insane or Teamshares was insane. Nobody hears "we're adding transcription and emotion detection to voice messages" and thinks the founder has lost their mind. They think "yeah, WhatsApp should do that" -- and WhatsApp literally did start doing it, adding voice message transcription in late 2024. When the incumbents are already building your roadmap as a feature, you don't have a company. You have a demo reel for a product manager interview at Meta.

The commoditization risk here isn't theoretical -- the dossier explicitly flags that "core technologies -- speech-to-text transcription, filler-word removal, emotion detection, and text-to-video generation -- are increasingly available through commodity APIs." The entire stack is OpenAI Whisper plus some UI polish. I said on CNBC last month that software companies that had moats are learning they aren't moats anymore. Resonate doesn't even have the moat to lose. It's starting from zero defensibility with no path to structural lock-in I can identify. The dossier's defensibility section literally reads "No defensibility signals found in public sources at this stage." Network effects require people to message each other inside Resonate rather than importing from WhatsApp -- but there's no mechanism to drive that adoption when every contact is already on an incumbent platform. And running multiple products simultaneously (Chat plus Create, with "many more in the works") at pre-seed with effectively zero team? That's a focus problem, not a vision.

Let me steelman this as hard as I can. The bull case would be: messaging is a protocol-layer opportunity, voice is eating text the way text ate voice calls, and whoever builds the voice-native communication primitive captures a generational platform shift. If Resonate's shareable transcripts create a viral loop where non-users see something magical and download the app -- the way early Venmo payments made people ask "what's Venmo?" -- then network effects could compound before incumbents catch up. Voice messaging grew 49% since 2020, Airchat's attempt at voice-first social didn't break through, so the space is genuinely open. If you squint, there's a world where "AI-processed voice" becomes a new communication medium, not just a feature on existing platforms. But I don't buy it. Venmo created a genuinely new payment primitive -- peer-to-peer mobile money transfer didn't exist before. Resonate is adding processing to an existing medium within existing platforms. That's an incremental improvement, not a new primitive. And the distribution math is brutal: you need both sides of a conversation to use your app for network effects to kick in, against incumbents who already have universal adoption.

No revenue, no pricing, seven App Store ratings, iOS-only, no press, no community, no distribution signals. At pre-seed I don't penalize absence of traction heavily, but I need at least one signal that demand exists beyond the founders' conviction. A waitlist of a thousand people. A viral TikTok showing the product. Anything. The YC page itself mentions "a desperate need for virality and growth," which reads less like strategy and more like an acknowledgment that organic pull isn't happening yet.
