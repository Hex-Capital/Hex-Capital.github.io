# Piris Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The defining fact about Piris Labs is that it's a two-person photonic hardware company competing in a market where four direct competitors have raised a combined $1.58 billion and still project first commercial products in 2027-2028. Lightmatter has $850M and an estimated $50M in revenue. Ayar Labs has $370M and backing from AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA. Olix and Neurophos have raised $250M and $118M respectively. Piris Labs has approximately $500K and a website with a tagline. I've made capital-intensive hardware bets before -- I led Anduril's $450M Series D -- but the conditions that made Anduril work are precisely what's absent here. When I invested in Anduril, there was a structural market vacuum after Google's Project Maven cancellation: no credible startup was building AI for defense. The photonic AI infrastructure market is the opposite of a vacuum. It's one of the most well-capitalized emerging sectors in deep tech.

The structural moment itself is real, and I want to be precise about what's genuine and what's not. The shift from training to inference as the dominant AI workload is a legitimate inflection. When inference costs become the binding constraint on AI deployment -- and they are, with trillion-parameter models hitting the memory wall -- any technology that fundamentally changes the data movement bottleneck has enormous value. The market projections ($97B inference market growing to $255B by 2030) reflect real demand growth, not speculative sizing. But here's where my framework diverges from what a generic investor might see: this is not a non-obvious market. When $1.5B in venture capital has already flowed into photonic AI hardware in the last two years, the insight that "photonics can solve the memory wall" is consensus. My best returns -- PagerDuty, Gusto, Coinbase in its earliest days -- came from markets other investors dismissed as too boring, too niche, or too unfamiliar. Nobody is dismissing photonic AI infrastructure. Everyone sees it.

The full-stack inference service model is the one genuinely interesting differentiation here, and it's worth exploring the bull case seriously. Lightmatter and Ayar Labs sell components. Olix and Neurophos are building optical processors. Piris Labs is proposing to build the whole stack -- photonic hardware plus software -- and deliver it as a service (cost per token). That's a distribution model insight, not just a technology choice. If they could actually deliver on "2x lower cost per token," they wouldn't need to convince data center operators to adopt new components; they'd just offer cheaper inference. That removes a significant go-to-market obstacle. And Khalatpour's credentials are genuinely elite -- his MIT PhD work on terahertz semiconductor lasers culminated in the optical engine for NASA's GUSTO mission. He's not a software engineer who watched a YouTube video about photonics. He's built photonic devices that operate in space. If you squint, this has the shape of a boomerang pattern: previous photonic computing startups failed because the manufacturing wasn't ready and the market demand wasn't acute enough. Both conditions have changed.

But the plan requires at least four miracles, and that's where I can't get comfortable. Miracle one: design novel photonic interconnect hardware that outperforms existing approaches. Miracle two: fabricate it at production-grade reliability and yield. Miracle three: build a software stack that integrates this hardware into existing AI inference workflows. Miracle four: raise the $50-100M+ required to do any of this before the well-funded competitors close the window. When I apply the single-miracle test, I'm looking for companies where the team has identified one critical obstacle and organized everything around it. Piris Labs has a compounding series of low-probability events, each dependent on the one before it. Khalatpour's photonics expertise is in terahertz spectroscopy -- genuinely deep physics, but the jump to data center interconnect manufacturing at scale is a different engineering discipline. The performance claims (5x lower latency, 10x lower power, 2x lower cost) are unverified by any third party, and no prototype or benchmark data is publicly visible.

I also notice this company sits uncomfortably in my "software-driven vs. software-aware" framework. The core competitive advantage here is photonic hardware design, not software. The software stack is important but complementary -- you could remove the software layer and the hardware innovation would still be the business. That's the opposite of the companies I typically back, where software IS the fundamental competitive mechanism. My portfolio is overwhelmingly weighted toward tools-for-builders and infrastructure-as-software. A photonic hardware company with a software layer is structurally different from a software infrastructure company that happens to work with hardware. The margin structure, the capital requirements, the development timeline, the competitive dynamics -- all of these map to hardware patterns, not software patterns.

The honest assessment is that this is a talented team in a real market with the wrong resource profile for the challenge they've chosen. If Khalatpour and Moghadam were joining Lightmatter or Ayar Labs as technical leadership, I'd be excited about their capabilities. As a standalone pre-seed company, the gap between their resources and what's required to compete is not a gap that YC-scale funding bridges. They need a fundamentally different capital formation strategy -- something closer to $20-50M in seed funding with a strategic hardware partner -- and even then, they'd be years behind competitors who are already shipping silicon photonics components to tier-one customers.
