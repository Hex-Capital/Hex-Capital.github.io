# RoboDock -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what's interesting about RoboDock: the founder-market fit is almost surgical. Zinny Weli designed the autonomous charging infrastructure for Zipline's drone fleet and built the charging system for Amazon's Astro robot. Celine Wang integrated actuator and sensor systems for autonomous semi-trucks at Plus. If you were casting a movie about two people who should build robotic depot automation, you'd cast these two. But when I ask my first question -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I hear back is an impressive resume, not a biographical thread that explains why this problem haunts them. Zinny's field engineering across rural Indonesia, UNESCO sites in Peru, wildlife reserves in China hints at something deeper, someone who's comfortable in unstructured environments far from Silicon Valley comfort. I want to pull on that thread. But from what's available, the connection between founder and problem reads as professional expertise rather than personal stake. The best founders I've backed -- the ones who survive when everything goes sideways -- are solving something that's woven into who they are, not just what they've done.

The competitive landscape is what gives me real pause, and it's the reason this doesn't generate the jolt I felt with Niantic or Crusoe. Robotic EV charging is not a dismissed category -- it's an active investment thesis. Rocsys has $44.6 million and partnerships with Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche. Mob Energy has nearly $29 million. EVAR won CES Innovation Awards. When I look at my best investments, they share a quality: nobody else wanted to fund them because the idea sounded absurd. SpaceX was private space when private space was a punchline. Crusoe was mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota. Those companies were unpopular and difficult to assess. RoboDock is neither -- it's a well-understood problem with well-funded competitors already executing on it. The specific framing of "full depot automation for autonomous fleets" versus "robotic charging connector" is a meaningful differentiation, but it's an incremental repositioning within a known category, not the kind of insight that makes other investors uncomfortable.

Now, the bull case deserves a full airing because there's a version of this that's genuinely exciting. Autonomous vehicle fleets are a fundamentally different customer than passenger EV owners. When there's no human driver, someone -- or something -- has to plug in the charger, inspect the vehicle, and manage the depot. Rocsys's OEM partnerships are built around passenger vehicles where a human is present. If AV fleets scale to the 76 million vehicles projected by 2035, depot automation becomes critical infrastructure, and the company that owns that layer sits at a bottleneck with compounding data advantages from every charge event. RoboDock's founders have precisely the technical credentials to build this. And I've learned to recognize infrastructure plays at inflection points -- that's the pattern behind SpaceX, Anduril, and Crusoe. If I squint, I can see RoboDock becoming the invisible plumbing that makes autonomous fleets actually work at scale. The question is whether the inflection point is here now or five years away, and whether a pre-seed team can survive long enough against incumbents who are already building in this direction.

What I can't get past is the near-term market reality. The addressable customer base today is essentially Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, and a handful of autonomous trucking companies. Any one of those operators could decide to build depot automation in-house -- it's exactly the kind of infrastructure function that a company running hundreds of vehicles might want to control. And hardware scaling is capital-intensive and slow, which means the timeline to meaningful revenue is long, and the company will need to raise significant capital against competitors who already have it. I don't see the regulatory moat or the network effects that would protect this business in the way Affirm's lending licenses or Flock Safety's community data create genuine barriers. The closed-loop learning system is promising in concept, but it's a website claim, not a demonstrated advantage.

The team dynamic is a question mark rather than a concern. Two founders with complementary skills -- one from the charging/energy side, one from the vehicle/mechatronics side -- and both connected to Stanford's robotics ecosystem. I don't see the red flags I've learned to watch for after HQ Trivia. But I also don't see evidence of how they found each other, how long they've worked together, or how they navigate disagreement. At two people and pre-seed, this isn't disqualifying, but it's information I'd want before writing a check.

I respect the engineering ambition here, and if Zinny sat across from me and told me a story about why autonomous fleet infrastructure keeps her up at night in a way that goes beyond her resume, I might feel differently. But right now, this looks like a capable team entering a competitive space without the biographical conviction or the anti-consensus weirdness that defines my best investments. The opportunity is real but the timing feels early, the competition is funded, and the idea doesn't make anyone uncomfortable -- which, in my experience, means consensus has already started to form.
