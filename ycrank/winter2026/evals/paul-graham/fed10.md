# Fed10 -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The origin story here is genuinely good. These founders didn't pick GovTech from a trend report. Armand was passing bills in the Nevada legislature before he could vote. He was the youngest Governor appointee in the state, drafting policy recommendations that became law. All three founders lobbied together, sat through law school lectures together, and are best friends. When they say they want to replace policy consultants with AI agents, they're describing automation of work their own hands have done. That's the organic discovery I look for -- the idea grew from their lives, not from a brainstorming session about what AI could disrupt next.

The co-founder dynamic is also exactly right. Best friends who collaborated on real work before deciding to start a company. I've seen the failure mode of strangers pairing up to chase an idea -- nine companies in one YC batch did that and all nine imploded within a year. These three have the pre-existing relationship that survives the stress of building something together. Armand brings the domain depth (Government at Harvard, actual legislative experience), Zayan brings technical capability (CS at Berkeley, Amazon offer at seventeen), and Winston bridges both worlds (CS and Political Science at Williams, government affairs with Nevada Democrats). The team composition is complementary in a way that feels natural rather than assembled.

Here's my concern, though: the schlep may not be deep enough to be the moat. When Stripe tackled payments, the schlep was the barrier -- dealing with banks, fraud systems, money transmission licenses, PCI compliance. That schlep didn't just scare competitors away initially; it kept them away for years because each layer of regulatory infrastructure took real time to build. Fed10's schlep is domain expertise -- understanding what a policy brief needs to say, knowing how different legislatures work, recognizing what matters in a bill. That's real, and generic AI teams will get it wrong in ways these founders won't. But it's expertise, not infrastructure. The underlying technology is an LLM reading legislative text, and that's reproducible by anyone with a foundation model API key and access to the same public bill data. USLege has already raised $2.7M doing something nearly identical. FiscalNote and Quorum, with $120M and $61M in revenue respectively, can layer AI analysis onto their existing platforms and customer bases tomorrow.

The bull case would require one of two things to be true: either the domain expertise advantage in output quality is larger and more durable than it appears -- that getting legislative analysis right is genuinely hard enough that generic AI teams consistently produce bad output, creating a real quality gap -- or that the "lobbyist CRM" workflow product creates switching costs that go beyond the analysis itself. If companies embed Fed10 into how their government affairs teams operate daily, the switching cost becomes workflow dependency rather than just analytical quality. That's a more defensible position. But I see no evidence of either dynamic yet -- no users, no revenue, no testimonials about output quality, no signal of workflow stickiness.

The total absence of traction data isn't disqualifying at pre-seed, but combined with the commoditization risk, it leaves me without the confirming evidence I'd need to feel conviction. These founders understand the problem from the inside, which is rare. But understanding the problem and building a defensible business around solving it are different things. The question I can't answer from this dossier is whether their domain expertise translates into a product that's measurably better than what a well-funded competitor could build in six months with a few policy consultants on retainer. If I could see even one corporate government affairs team using Fed10 and preferring it to their existing tools -- one real signal of pull -- that would shift my calculus significantly.

This lands in the space between interesting and investable. The organic origin is strong enough that I'd want to talk to these founders. The team composition and co-founder chemistry are right. But the competitive landscape is already forming around them, the technical moat is thin, and there's nothing yet showing that users are pulling this product toward them. I'd watch this one closely and revisit if they demonstrate that their domain expertise produces output quality that generic competitors genuinely can't match.
