# RunAnywhere -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me about RunAnywhere isn't the founders or the product -- it's the competitive landscape, and not in a good way. On-device AI is one of the most heavily invested categories in technology right now. Meta shipped ExecuTorch to 1.0 and runs it across Instagram, WhatsApp, and Ray-Ban glasses for billions of users. Google has MediaPipe. Apple has MLX and controls the iOS runtime itself. Nexa AI has $3.4M in revenue, 31 people, and up to $16.5M in funding. When I look at a space and see every giant in the room already building, that's the opposite of the signal I trust. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe -- were ones where the consensus was that the idea was absurd. Nobody was competing because nobody believed in the category. Here, everybody believes. Everybody's building. That's a profoundly different risk profile, and it's the kind of hot-market convergence I've learned to step away from.

My process always starts with the founder's story, and this is where RunAnywhere goes quiet on me. I want to hear how someone got to where they are -- not the pitch, not the architecture diagram, but the journey that made this problem theirs to solve. What I have are two software engineers from Rochester Institute of Technology with solid infrastructure backgrounds -- Intuit and AWS -- which are technically relevant credentials. But I'm not hearing the biographical thread that tells me *why* on-device AI is their fight, the thing they'd pour themselves into when the company hits its inevitable crisis. When I backed the Crusoe team, their story about turning waste gas into computation was inseparable from who they were. When I met Travis, I felt his gravitas before I understood the business model. Here, I see competent builders in a trending space, and that's a very different thing from founders whose life story made them the only people who could solve this specific problem.

The bull case deserves serious engagement, because the "Kubernetes for on-device AI" framing is genuinely interesting. If small LLMs have truly crossed the quality threshold for production use on consumer devices, and if privacy regulations keep pushing compute to the edge, then someone will own the control plane layer -- the routing, fleet management, policy enforcement, and observability across heterogeneous device fleets. That's a real infrastructure need. The 9,000 GitHub stars and 1,663 commits show these founders can ship and attract developer attention. The open-core model with a free SDK converting to paid enterprise management is a proven playbook. And the argument that Meta and Google won't build a commercial control plane because it would cannibalize their cloud revenue has historical precedent -- AWS didn't prevent Datadog or HashiCorp from building enormous businesses. If RunAnywhere executes perfectly and the category timing aligns, there's a path to something substantial.

But that bull case requires me to believe two things I can't get comfortable with. First, that the control plane differentiation holds -- because OTA model delivery, A/B testing, and analytics are features, not a product category, and any of these incumbents could add them in a quarter. Second, that a two-person team can win enterprise deals in a space where their competitors have Meta's engineering org and Nexa's 31-person team with existing revenue. Enterprise sales cycles require solutions engineers, support capacity, and trust-building that doesn't scale with just two people, no matter how talented. And the brand itself -- "RunAnywhere" -- is so generic it's going to fight for discoverability against every Java joke ever written.

What I don't see through my particular lens is any economic access angle or invisible-system-made-visible dynamic. This is B2B infrastructure tooling for developers at well-funded companies. It doesn't create income for underserved workers like Uber did for drivers, or bring transparency to opaque power structures like Carta did for equity or Affirm did for credit. It doesn't operate in a regulated or stigmatized space that deters other investors -- quite the opposite, it's the space everyone's racing into. And the co-founder dynamic, while not raising red flags (shared RIT background, working closely together), gives me no data on how they handle disagreement under pressure. I'm passing -- not because the company is bad, but because nothing here activates the signals I've learned to trust after 130+ investments and 42 exits. Competent founders building infrastructure in a consensus category is a bet someone should make, but it's not my kind of bet.
