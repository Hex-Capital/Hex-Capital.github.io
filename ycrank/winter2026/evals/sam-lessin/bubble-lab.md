# Bubble Lab -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is the company I describe on CNBC when I'm explaining why AI is a bad startup investment. I'm not being glib — Bubble Lab is almost structurally designed to illustrate the thesis. An AI-powered version of Zapier, living inside Slack, translating natural language into API calls across SaaS tools. The core capability is explicitly identified in their own competitive analysis as "technically reproducible." Zapier has $310 million in revenue and 8,000 integrations. n8n just raised $240 million at $2.5 billion and has LangChain baked into 70+ nodes. Make got absorbed into Celonis's $13 billion distribution engine. The question I always ask — "would this business be good if AI didn't exist?" — and the answer is: this business would not exist if AI didn't exist. It IS an AI capability, not a business with AI as a cherry on top. That's a feature waiting to get absorbed by every incumbent in the space simultaneously.

The founder-idea pairing doesn't hit my filter. Selina Li's JPMorgan quant research background is credible in isolation, but it doesn't map to deep expertise in operations workflow automation — the actual problem space. Zach Zhong's "3x founding engineer" credential at his age likely means very early-stage roles, not infrastructure-scale shipping experience. More telling: they pivoted from gymii.ai, a consumer nutrition tracking app, to enterprise workflow automation within the same year. That's not a domain-obsessed team that lived inside the problem — it's talented builders searching for a market. And the idea itself is about as far from "insane" as you can get in 2026. "Use AI to automate workflows" is the single most obvious application of LLMs in enterprise software. Every VC in the building is excited about this category. When every investor thinks an idea makes sense, the non-consensus premium has been completely arbitraged away.

The structural moat question is where this falls apart most decisively. The business is pure software. There's no physical-world operational complexity, no regulatory position, no protocol-layer lock-in. The "long-term memory" feature — Pearl learning user preferences and process knowledge — is thin switching cost dressed up as defensibility. Any LLM-based competitor can implement memory and context windows. The open-source angle is actively counterproductive: they've licensed under Apache 2.0 but closed external contributions as of January 2026, which means competitors can fork the code while the community gets no incentive to contribute. That's the worst of both worlds. And the Slack platform dependency is a textbook example of building on someone else's infrastructure with no path to becoming the standard. If Slack decides to ship native AI workflow automation — and they will, because every platform is — Bubble Lab is directly in the kill zone.

The strongest bull case would go something like this: Zapier's massive revenue proves the market is real, and the paradigm shift from rule-based to AI-native automation is genuinely disruptive — similar to how new interaction models can unseat incumbents even with distribution disadvantages. The 3,800 users in a short window suggest real pull. SOC 2 Type 1 shows enterprise seriousness from day one. If Pearl's conversational interface and Slack-native deployment create a viral adoption loop inside organizations, Bubble Lab could become the default way non-technical ops teams interact with their tool stack. For this to work, you'd need to believe that incumbents can't graft natural language interfaces onto their existing platforms without cannibalizing their visual-builder revenue — a real tension, since Zapier's entire business model is built around users paying for increasingly complex automation rules. The disruptive innovation playbook says the new entrant wins by being "worse" in ways that don't matter to new users and "better" in the dimension that does. Maybe prompt-driven automation is that wedge. I'd need to believe that, AND that among the dozens of startups pursuing this exact thesis, this specific two-person team with no prior exits and a recent pivot from consumer nutrition wins the race against n8n's $240 million war chest. I don't believe it.

This company sits in the precise intersection of my two biggest avoidance criteria: an AI-first product where AI constitutes the entire value proposition, in a SaaS category where incumbents with overwhelming distribution are actively replicating the same capability. It's a tech company with a paint layer, not a painting company with a tech layer. The 16 integrations versus Zapier's 8,000 is a distribution gap that natural language interfaces don't close — they actually widen it, because the LLM's usefulness scales with how many tools it can orchestrate. Pass.
