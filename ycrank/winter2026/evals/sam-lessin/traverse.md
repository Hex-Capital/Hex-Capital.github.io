# Traverse -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my problem with Traverse: this is the most consensus idea wearing the thinnest non-consensus disguise I've seen in a while. Building RL environments for frontier AI labs is not an insane idea -- it's the idea that Wing VC literally published an investment thesis about, that 35+ companies are already pursuing, and that Scale AI at $29B valuation is expanding into as a line extension. When I run my filter -- is this a sane person with an insane idea? -- I get something closer to reasonable people chasing a recognized opportunity. The "non-deterministic verifier" angle sounds differentiated in a pitch deck, but the structural question is whether that specialization constitutes a genuinely distinct market or just a feature within the broader RL environment space that Scale AI's army of domain experts will absorb. Nothing in this dossier convinces me it's the former.

The AI-dependency problem here is as severe as I've encountered. My core test -- would this business be good if AI didn't exist? -- doesn't just produce a "no." It produces a "this business literally has no reason to exist without AI." The entire customer base is frontier AI labs. The entire product is AI training infrastructure. The entire growth story depends on AI labs continuing to outsource RL environment construction rather than building in-house. This is the polar opposite of my "cherry on top" framework. When I invested in Craftwork, the painting business works regardless of what happens to AI -- the software layer is an accelerant on an existing economic activity. Traverse has no underlying economic activity without AI. It's a tech company selling to tech companies about tech. That's the structural fragility that keeps me up at night.

The competitive dynamics compound my concern. Mechanize is already working with Anthropic, backed by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, offering $500K engineering salaries. Scale AI has $870M in revenue and existing relationships with every lab. Surge AI pulled $1.2B in 2024. And Traverse is a two-person team that pivoted into this space during their YC batch -- the Clice AI redirect to traverse.so tells me this current direction is weeks or months old, not years. My portfolio taught me that patience works when you're betting on a protocol layer with compounding dynamics that reward early positioning. But patience in a services market with concentrated buyers and well-resourced competitors isn't patience -- it's hoping for a miracle. Wing VC projects consolidation to 3-5 leaders by 2030, and I see nothing structural that positions Traverse to survive that shakeout.

Let me steelman the bull case, because the non-deterministic verifier problem is genuinely intellectually interesting. If building verifiers for taste-dependent, subjective domains really does require fundamentally different expertise than scaling deterministic labeling -- if it's more art than manufacturing -- then Scale AI's advantages don't transfer cleanly. The argument would be that expertise in constructing verifiers for medicine, law, and scientific research constitutes a learning-curve moat that deepens with each domain engagement, and that the methodology itself could become a new primitive: a standard framework for how AI labs approach non-deterministic training. If that story plays out, and if Lance Yan's ML background at wat.ai and Kalshi's probabilistic reasoning environment gave him genuine insight into subjective verification, Traverse could emerge as the specialist that larger players can't replicate despite their resources. But that story requires several things to be simultaneously true: the non-deterministic distinction must be a real barrier, not just marketing; the founders must have unique insight despite lacking direct frontier lab experience; and the market must remain outsourced rather than moving in-house. I don't have evidence for any of these conditions.

On the founders specifically -- both are technically capable Waterloo CS students with ML-adjacent experience, but neither has worked inside a frontier lab's RL training pipeline. Lance led ML at a university AI organization and worked at Kalshi; Zachary worked at Mercor and Uber AI Solutions. That's relevant but not the "sane person" signal I need for a bet this structurally challenging. When I backed the Solana team, Anatoly Yakovenko brought Qualcomm systems engineering at the infrastructure layer -- the credibility was specific to the exact problem being solved. Here, the founders are building RL environments for frontier labs without having been inside a frontier lab. The pivot from Clice AI also raises my "fundraising optimizer" antenna -- shifting from one hot AI category to another during a YC batch is pattern-matching to market heat, not pursuing deep conviction born from lived experience.

This is a pass. The idea is consensus, the competitive moat is nonexistent, the AI dependency is total, the customer base is capped at a handful of labs, and the founders -- while technically competent -- lack the specific domain credibility that would make me believe they see something Scale AI's team of thousands cannot. I'd rather fund a company that exists in the physical world and uses AI to get better at it than fund a company that exists entirely inside the AI ecosystem and depends on AI labs continuing to outsource critical training infrastructure to a two-person startup.
