# DAIVIN! -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that immediately grabs me about DAIVIN! is that this problem has been hiding in plain sight for a hundred years. Every diver on Earth knows that compressed gas tanks are the bottleneck — they limit depth, duration, and safety. Electrolysis is chemistry you learn in high school. The insight that oxygen supply is "fundamentally an energy problem" rather than a gas logistics problem is the kind of reframing that, once you hear it, sounds obvious. So why hasn't anyone done this? Because the schlep is terrifying. You're not just building a gadget — you're building a life-support system that generates hydrogen gas next to a breathing human underwater. You need to navigate regulatory frameworks that don't exist yet for your category of device. You need to make it work reliably at 200 meters, where failure means death. This is schlep blindness operating at maximum intensity. The problem is obvious, the chemistry is known, and nobody wants to touch it because the engineering-plus-safety-plus-regulatory burden is genuinely frightening. That part I like a lot.

Where I start to worry is when I apply what I call the "multiple miracles" test. Some startups need one breakthrough to succeed — Boom needs to build the plane, and if they do, the economics follow. DAIVIN! needs the portable electrolysis to generate sufficient oxygen flow rates at depth (unproven at claimed specs), hydrogen to be safely managed in an underwater breathing context (novel safety challenge), regulatory approval for a device category that has no existing framework (potentially years of work), and a solo founder to execute all of this across electrochemistry, mechanical engineering, materials science, and embedded systems simultaneously. Each of these is a load-bearing requirement. The probability of all four converging is the product of their individual probabilities, and that math gets unforgiving quickly.

The solo founder question here is not a soft preference — it's structural. I told Drew Houston he needed a co-founder before I'd fund Dropbox, and Dropbox was software. One brilliant programmer can write file-sync code. But building life-support hardware that spans this many engineering disciplines is categorically different. Leo Kankkunen's credentials are genuinely impressive — youngest person in Finland to earn the highest national electrical certification, seven years in the electrical industry, certified diver, military veteran, claims to be a two-time founder. The core technology challenge of electrolysis is fundamentally electrical, which aligns with his expertise. But the product also requires mechanical engineering for the underwater enclosure, materials science for membrane technology, embedded systems for the redundancy architecture, and eventually manufacturing expertise. I don't see how one person covers all of that, no matter how talented.

The bull case is real though, and I want to state it clearly. If Kankkunen has actually built and tested a working electrolysis dive system — and the claim on the YC page that he "invented and tested the first-ever tankless dive gear in history" suggests he has — then the technical risk is lower than it appears from the outside. A working prototype, even at shallow depth, would mean the core physics works and the remaining challenge is engineering optimization rather than scientific discovery. If he finds a strong co-founder with complementary skills (mechanical, materials), the team gap closes. And the defense market doesn't care about price — if a military diver can go to 200 meters without nitrogen narcosis and without hauling tanks of helium, that capability is worth almost anything. A single defense contract could fund the company through years of development. The schlep itself becomes the moat: no one else will want to certify life-support equipment in this novel category, which means whoever gets through the regulatory door first owns the market. That's the Stripe pattern applied to hardware.

But I don't have enough signal to overcome my concerns. There's no evidence of user pull — not a single diver testimonial, no LOI from a defense customer, no video of a prototype working underwater. At pre-seed I don't demand revenue, but for a claim this extraordinary ("first-ever tankless dive gear") I'd want to see something: a thirty-second video, a quote from a dive instructor who tried it, a Navy contact who expressed interest. The YC Launch metrics (28 upvotes, 73 Twitter followers) tell me nothing about whether this technology actually works. The absence of any technical demonstration or user validation for what amounts to a life-support device makes it impossible for me to assess whether this is a genuine breakthrough or a promising idea that hasn't yet survived contact with physics.

The idea is the right shape. Hundred-year-old technology, obvious problem, schlep that scares everyone away, and a reframing that converts it from a logistics challenge to an energy challenge. That's how the best startup ideas look before they work. But the execution requirements here — solo founder, multi-disciplinary hardware, life-safety certification, unproven physics claims — stack up to a bet I can't make with my own money at this stage. I'd want to see two things before reconsidering: a co-founder with complementary hardware/materials expertise, and a demonstrated prototype working at any meaningful depth. Either one alone might not be enough, but both together would change the calculus significantly.
