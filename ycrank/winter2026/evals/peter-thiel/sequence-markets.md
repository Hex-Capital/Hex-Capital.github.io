# Sequence Markets -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells you everything you need to know. Talos at $1.5 billion. FalconX at $8 billion. CoinRoutes with a granted patent on smart order routing in crypto markets. Wyden raising capital to onboard twenty-plus European banks. sFOX processing over $600 billion in transaction volume. And now Sequence Markets, a five-person pre-seed team, enters this arena claiming that "AI-powered routing" will differentiate them from players who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and spent years building institutional relationships. This is not a market with a hidden secret waiting to be uncovered. This is a market where every serious participant already agrees on the thesis -- institutions need better crypto execution -- and multiple well-capitalized companies are racing to serve that thesis. The mimetic dynamics are unmistakable: each player is building roughly the same product (liquidity aggregation, smart order routing, best execution reporting) for roughly the same customers (institutional crypto traders). When I see five funded companies converging on identical positioning, I see a category where no one possesses a genuine insight that the others lack. The "market is large" framing -- $25 billion growing to $155 billion -- is precisely the kind of TAM argument that masks the absence of monopoly economics.

What is the secret here? I cannot find one. The proposition that institutional crypto trading suffers from fragmented liquidity and poor execution quality is not a truth that few people agree with -- it is the founding thesis of every competitor in this space. Smart order routing itself is a concept imported directly from traditional equities, where firms like Virtu and Citadel Securities perfected it decades ago. Applying an existing technique from one asset class to another is the textbook definition of going from one to n. The "AI-powered" modifier is the kind of undifferentiated language that has become meaningless in 2026 -- when every fintech company claims AI, it ceases to be a distinguishing characteristic. Without published benchmarks, proprietary research, or demonstrated performance superiority, the AI claim is positioning, not technology. Meanwhile, CoinRoutes holds an actual patent on smart order routing in crypto, which creates not only competitive pressure but genuine intellectual property risk for anyone building in this exact space.

The non-custodial, venue-neutral architecture is the most intellectually interesting element of the positioning. There is a structural argument that vertically integrated prime brokers like FalconX and Talos face cannibalization risk if they unbundle execution at lower price points -- their higher-margin bundled offerings depend on keeping execution, custody, and credit intertwined. A neutral execution layer could theoretically exploit this conflict of interest, the way Bloomberg terminals created a neutral information layer that investment banks couldn't replicate without undermining their own advisory businesses. But this argument, while directionally sound, does not constitute a secret. Every market participant can see this structural dynamic. And the non-custodial architecture itself is a business model choice, not a proprietary technology -- any sufficiently motivated competitor could adopt the same approach without meaningful switching costs or technical barriers.

I should acknowledge the strongest bull case. The convergence of MiCA's best-execution mandates in Europe and the acceleration of real-world asset tokenization -- BCG projects $16 trillion in tokenized assets by 2030 -- creates a genuinely novel execution challenge. Routing orders across both crypto-native venues and tokenized traditional asset platforms is a problem that doesn't yet have an established solution. If Sequence Markets were positioning itself specifically at this intersection -- becoming the execution infrastructure for the tokenized-asset world rather than competing for existing crypto order flow -- there might be a path to owning a new category. Peter Bai's experience at TMX Group gives him direct exposure to how traditional exchange infrastructure operates, and his pension fund background provides domain understanding of institutional execution requirements. These are relevant credentials for this problem. But the company's current positioning does not articulate this as a distinct thesis. The website describes "best execution for tokenized assets and the world of tokenization," yet the product as presented is a liquidity aggregator across existing crypto exchanges -- the same product every competitor offers. The gap between the potential thesis (execution infrastructure for the tokenization era) and the actual product (smart order routing for crypto) is where conviction would need to form, and I see no evidence that the founders have a definite plan to bridge it.

The founders themselves present a pattern I find difficult to invest behind at this stage. Both appear to be early-career -- Awan is an incoming Databricks intern, Bai is a recent Ivey HBA graduate. Building sub-millisecond latency execution infrastructure for institutional clients who measure performance in microseconds is among the most technically demanding problems in financial technology. The teams that have succeeded at this -- at Jump Trading, at Citadel Securities, at the exchanges themselves -- are staffed by engineers with deep systems programming expertise developed over years. I do not see evidence of that depth here, and a team of five competing against organizations with hundreds of engineers and established institutional relationships faces structural disadvantages that YC mentorship alone cannot overcome. Bai's TMX experience provides relevant context, but operating within exchange infrastructure and building it from scratch are categorically different challenges.

This is a pass. The company enters a competitive market with a consensus thesis, offers incremental technology improvements that lack demonstrated superiority, and faces an incumbent landscape that is actively consolidating through acquisitions and strategic investments. There is no visible path to monopoly -- the execution layer for crypto trading has weak network effects, minimal switching costs, and no proprietary technology barrier that would prevent well-funded competitors from replicating the approach. The power law demands that every investment must have the potential to return the entire fund, which requires a company that can achieve and sustain monopoly in its market. I see no mechanism by which Sequence Markets escapes the gravitational pull of competition in this crowded category.
