# Proximitty -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells you everything you need to know before you even ask about the product. LoanPro has raised $100 million and generates $24 million in revenue. Prodigal, itself YC-backed, has $14 million in funding and launched "proAgent" in 2025 -- an AI agent for consumer finance that directly mirrors Proximitty's core proposition. Sedric raised $22 million for AI compliance monitoring. Kolleno raised $5 million for AI-driven collections. This is not a market with a secret hiding in it. This is a market where every intelligent observer has arrived at the same conclusion -- that AI agents can automate loan servicing and collections -- and multiple well-funded teams are racing to execute on that identical insight. The thesis "AI can replace manual collections workflows" is approximately as contrarian as "software is eating the world" was in 2015. When I look at this landscape, I see mimetic convergence -- companies imitating each other toward the same customers, the same positioning, and eventually the same margin destruction. The absence of a non-consensus truth at the foundation means there is no structural path to monopoly, only a path to competition.

What would the secret need to be? Not "collections is inefficient and AI can help" -- everyone knows that. A genuine secret would be something like: autonomous AI agents will be trusted by regulators to make legally binding borrower communications without human oversight, and we have a specific regulatory strategy to make that happen before anyone else. Or: the unified data layer, once trained on an institution's complete borrower history, creates a compounding intelligence advantage that makes switching mathematically irrational. But neither claim is substantiated. The first is actually contradicted by the compliance liability risk the dossier itself identifies -- regulators have every incentive to restrict autonomous AI agents in consumer-facing financial interactions, not enable them. The second requires years of deployment data that does not yet exist. What I see instead is a classic integration play: combine voice AI, compliance monitoring, browser automation, and a data layer into one platform. Integration is a product strategy, not a secret about the world. A well-resourced competitor -- and LoanPro with $100 million certainly qualifies -- can build the same integration on top of existing distribution.

The founding team is competent but does not exhibit the profile I associate with my strongest investments. Ho's McKinsey background is a mild negative signal in my framework -- consultants identify market opportunities through analytical frameworks rather than through the kind of obsessive, often irrational conviction that characterizes founders who build monopolies. The Taptap Send experience provides real fintech domain exposure, which matters, but growth leadership at a remittance startup is not the same as having built lending infrastructure from the inside. Zhang's work on ACI.dev -- 4,700 GitHub stars, a genuine open-source project -- demonstrates real technical building ability and is the strongest individual signal in this dossier. But ACI.dev is a general-purpose tool-calling platform, not a lending-specific technical moat. The team's capabilities are well-matched to the problem at a surface level, but I do not detect the kind of definite, singular vision -- a specific theory of the future that the founders refuse to compromise -- that separates the companies I invest in from competent startups pursuing market opportunities.

The strongest bull case would require believing three things simultaneously: first, that the "unified data layer" creates switching costs so severe that early customers become permanently locked in, turning a competitive market into a series of institution-level monopolies; second, that the no-code browser automation via computer vision is genuinely difficult to replicate and provides the wedge that gets Proximitty inside institutions faster than API-dependent competitors; and third, that the team's combination of fintech domain and AI infrastructure experience allows them to outexecute better-funded competitors on a narrower budget. If you believe all three, the $9-10 billion combined TAM and the claim of serving "publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" begin to look interesting. There is a version of this story where Proximitty becomes the system of record for AI-native loan servicing at mid-market institutions while incumbents like Fiserv and Black Knight struggle to re-architect their legacy batch-processing platforms. But this requires Proximitty to win a footrace against Prodigal (which has years of production data and existing lender relationships), LoanPro (which has seven times the funding), and whatever the incumbents eventually build -- without any structural advantage that removes them from the race entirely.

The go-to-market compounds my concerns. Proximitty claims to serve "publicly traded fintechs and banks globally" without naming a single customer. In regulated financial services, enterprise sales cycles run six to eighteen months, and a two-person team navigating bank procurement, compliance review, and security assessment simultaneously while building a product that spans voice AI, compliance monitoring, browser automation, and data integration is attempting to boil the ocean. There is no evidence of the small-market-first strategy that characterizes my best investments. Facebook started at Harvard. PayPal started with eBay power sellers. Where does Proximitty start? The answer appears to be "everywhere at once" -- banks, credit unions, and fintechs globally -- which is precisely the signal I associate with competitive thinking rather than monopoly thinking.

This is a pass. The founders are building in a real market with real pain, and their technical credentials are legitimate. But the core thesis is consensus, the competitive landscape is crowded with better-funded players converging on the same approach, and nothing in the dossier reveals a secret -- an important truth that most intelligent people would actively reject. Without a secret, there is no monopoly. Without a monopoly, returns converge to zero. The lending industry needs better technology, but needing better technology is not the same as having a secret about how to provide it.
