# Oximy -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The competitive landscape tells the entire story before I even reach the product. Harmonic Security has raised $26 million. Noma Security has raised $132 million. Grip Security has raised $66 million. Prompt Security raised $23 million before being absorbed by SentinelOne. And behind these startups stand the endpoint incumbents -- Microsoft with Defender and Copilot's native admin console, CrowdStrike with agents already deployed on hundreds of millions of endpoints, and browser security companies like Island and LayerX that already intercept web-based application usage. When I see this many well-capitalized players converging on the same thesis from adjacent positions, the diagnosis is immediate: there is no secret here. "Enterprises need visibility into shadow AI" is not a contrarian truth that few people agree with -- it is the most frequently discussed problem at every CISO conference in 2025 and 2026. Every board deck includes a slide about AI governance risk. The EU AI Act mandates it. NIST published a framework for it. This is consensus dressed as opportunity, and consensus markets are where returns go to die.

The dossier itself confirms the absence of technological discontinuity with unusual candor: "the core technology -- monitoring desktop/browser activity and classifying AI tool interactions -- is not technically unique." A desktop agent that watches browser activity and classifies which AI tools employees are using is not a zero-to-one invention. It is a feature -- one that any endpoint vendor, MDM platform, or browser security company could add to their existing product in a quarter. The 3,500-tool detection library sounds impressive as a number, but classification databases are engineering work, not proprietary science. CrowdStrike maintains a threat intelligence database orders of magnitude more complex. Microsoft already knows which applications its Copilot ecosystem interacts with. Oximy's three modules -- adoption analytics, spend tracking, and governance mapping -- are each individually available within existing enterprise tool categories. Combining them into one platform is an integration play, not a technology play. Integration without structural defensibility is a temporary convenience, not a monopoly.

The bull case deserves genuine engagement. If "category straddling" is real -- if the intersection of SaaS management, AI security, and compliance governance creates a genuinely new system of record that no incumbent from any single adjacent category can replicate without expanding into the other two -- then the first company to own that intersection could build meaningful switching costs. Enterprise buyers hate managing three vendors when one will do. The regulatory tailwind is real and accelerating: the EU AI Act creates mandatory governance requirements that didn't exist two years ago. And Naman Ambavi's track record, while modest in scale, shows a founder who can ship compliant enterprise software -- Easocare achieved SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 certifications, which is non-trivial for a small team. His time at Induced AI (Sam Altman-backed, working with LLMs and RAG systems) gave him direct exposure to the AI tool ecosystem he now proposes to govern. If he can execute faster than the well-funded competitors who are each approaching from only one direction, the convergence point could be defensible. But this "if" requires outrunning companies with 25x or more capital, as a solo founder with a five-person team. The race favors the well-resourced when the technology is replicable.

What I find most telling is the product strategy itself. Oximy offers a standalone product at $49/month, an enterprise platform at undisclosed pricing, cloud deployment, on-premises deployment, an open-source core, and self-hosting. This is not the profile of a company with a definite vision -- it is the profile of a company trying to find its market. A founder with genuine conviction about where AI governance is headed would make hard choices: this deployment model, this buyer, this price point, this specific wedge. Instead, I see optionality maximization, which is precisely what indefinite optimism looks like in product strategy. Compare this to Stripe, which launched with a single thesis -- developers want a simple payments API -- and ignored every other buyer and deployment model until they had completely owned that niche. Oximy is trying to be the system of record for everyone, everywhere, deployed every way, at every price point. That is not a secret; it is a search.

The founder's trajectory compounds my concern rather than alleviating it. Easocare reached $223,000 in revenue at a $669,000 valuation after five years -- a company that survived but never achieved escape velocity. The pivot from Indian healthtech to San Francisco enterprise AI governance is a significant domain discontinuity. I have no doubt Naman can build software and ship product -- the compliance certifications and the repeat investor backing him attest to that. But building software is necessary and not sufficient. What I need to see at this stage is a founder who has identified something about the world that the well-funded competitors have missed, who can articulate specifically why their architectural choices make the existing approaches obsolete, and who demonstrates the kind of conviction that refuses easier paths. The evidence instead suggests a capable builder who identified a large, visible market and is racing to assemble a competent product. In a market without structural barriers to entry, execution speed is a temporary advantage that erodes the moment a larger player decides to bundle.

This is, in the Girardian sense, a mimetic market -- multiple companies imitating each other into the same competitive space, differentiated only by which axis they emphasize (prompt security versus adoption analytics versus spend management versus infrastructure security). The mutual imitation will compress margins and force consolidation, as Prompt Security's acquisition by SentinelOne already demonstrates. The endgame is not an independent monopoly but absorption into a larger platform. Companies built to be absorbed are not power-law investments.
