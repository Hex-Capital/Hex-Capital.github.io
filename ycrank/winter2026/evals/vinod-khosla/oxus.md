# Oxus -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is the company I describe when people ask me what I pass on. An AI tool that makes SOX compliance paperwork 30% faster for internal auditors at public companies. The team is credentialed, the market exists, the technology works. And I stop right there -- if Oxus succeeds completely, captures significant market share, and becomes the standard tool for internal audit automation, what has changed? Auditors fill out forms faster. Workpapers get generated with fewer hours. Nobody's life is fundamentally different. No industry gets disrupted. The regulatory burden hasn't been eliminated -- it's been made slightly less painful to execute. The consequence of total success is a nice SaaS business in a market that multiple estimates peg between $1.2 billion and $3.2 billion. AuditBoard got acquired for $3 billion after years of growth, and that's the ceiling this company is reaching toward -- not disrupting how companies are governed, not replacing the audit function, not reimagining financial accountability. Just making the existing process marginally more efficient. These founders are too smart to spend their careers on this.

The competitive landscape reinforces the problem. Fieldguide has $125 million in capital and a $700 million valuation already building AI-native audit tools. AuditBoard has 2,000 enterprise customers and relationships with half the Fortune 500. Workiva generates $739 million in annual revenue. And Denki, another YC company, is attacking the same space from the services side. When incumbents with billions in enterprise relationships are actively adding AI features, and a well-funded startup already occupies the AI-native position in adjacent audit segments, the window for a pre-seed entrant requires either radical technology differentiation or a fundamentally different approach to the problem. I see neither here. The core technology -- LLM-based document analysis and structured output generation -- is the most commoditizable application of current AI. Any team with reasonable AI engineering ability can build this. That's not disruption; that's a feature race with opponents who have hundred-million-dollar head starts.

The team has the credentials you'd expect from three MIT graduates who studied computer science, economics, and finance: Janet Liu's Federal Reserve and D.E. Shaw experience, Melinda Liu's JPMorgan and fintech background, Christine Watts's ML engineering and BCG consulting work. These are exactly the industry-adjacent insiders I'm skeptical of -- finance people building finance tools, consultants building consulting tools. They know the audit workflow intimately, which means they know what's considered possible and what's considered sufficient. That's precisely the knowledge set that constrains ambition. Where's the outsider who looks at the entire audit function and asks why it exists in its current form? Where's the biochemistry professor who doesn't know what the compliance industry considers impossible? Christine Watts's story of getting into YC at 19 as the first founder from Tajikistan hints at unconventional ambition, but the company they've built channels that ambition into the most conventional possible application of current AI technology.

Let me steel-man the case. The CPA talent shortage is real -- 75% of CPAs projected to retire in the next decade. That's a structural supply contraction meeting inflexible regulatory demand, which creates genuine urgency for automation. The auditor-in-the-loop positioning is smart for enterprise trust. Annual audit cycles create natural switching costs. And the "tool-for-teams" approach versus Denki's "services replacement" model could prove more adoptable in risk-averse compliance departments. If Oxus could expand from SOX into operational audits, IT audits, and broader risk management, the addressable market grows substantially. There's a version of this story where they build deep domain data moats through customer-specific institutional knowledge and become the AI layer that every internal audit function runs on. But that story requires believing they can outrun Fieldguide's capital, AuditBoard's relationships, and the inevitable AI feature additions from every GRC vendor simultaneously -- all while selling into one of the most risk-averse buyer personas in the enterprise. The bull case is a solid business. It's not a world-changing one.

The timing argument is reasonable but not distinctive. Yes, LLMs just crossed the capability threshold for reliable audit document processing. But that's now consensus -- every audit vendor knows this, every AI startup sees the opportunity. Oxus isn't skating to where the puck will be; they're arriving at the same moment as a dozen other players with more resources. When I backed OpenAI in 2019, AI capability was accelerating but nobody else was writing checks. When I backed Impossible Foods, plant-based protein engineering was advancing but the food industry dismissed it. Here, the technology curve is visible to everyone, and the incumbents are already responding. That's not the timing signature I look for.
