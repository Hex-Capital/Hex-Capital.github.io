# Visibl Semiconductors -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most important fact about Visibl is one that cuts against them: ChipAgents has $74M in funding, 80 semiconductor company deployments, and 140x year-over-year ARR growth. Cognichip has $33M from Lux and Mayfield. Synopsys.ai already has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. Cadence launched ChipStack AI Agent in February 2026. When I evaluate a market, the first question is "what has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now?" The answer here -- LLMs crossing capability thresholds for interpreting complex EDA tool outputs -- is real. But the critical follow-up is whether this insight is non-obvious or consensus. By early 2026, AI for chip design is unambiguously consensus. Capital has flooded in, multiple startups have production deployments, and both incumbents are shipping AI features. This is not a market where a 2-person pre-seed team has a structural information advantage.

Compare the timing to how I thought about Harvey in 2022. Legal AI was dismissed as a science project -- nobody credible was funding it, the models couldn't do it yet, and the team was building ahead of the capability curve to capture share the moment GPT-4 shipped. That's what positioning at a structural inflection looks like: you're early enough that the market appears impossible. Visibl is entering a market where the inflection has already been recognized, the capital has already deployed, and the leading startup already has 80 production customers. When I see 140x YoY ARR growth at a competitor, that tells me the adoption curve isn't inflecting -- it has inflected. Being late to a real cycle is a fundamentally different position than being early to one.

The "AI-native IDE" architectural framing is the strongest element of their thesis. ChipAgents integrates with existing Synopsys and Cadence tool suites; Visibl positions as a standalone coordination layer that ingests full design context rather than operating as a productivity add-on. The argument would be that building ground-up creates better architectural choices -- the way Stripe built developer-first payments infrastructure rather than bolting APIs onto legacy payment rails. But this analogy breaks down on a critical dimension: PayPal wasn't a fast-moving startup when Stripe entered. ChipAgents is. And the standalone IDE approach actually creates a distribution headwind for Visibl -- you're asking semiconductor enterprises to adopt a new tool ecosystem rather than enhancing the Synopsys and Cadence environments they already use daily. In a market where procurement cycles are measured in quarters and IP sensitivity makes every new tool vendor a trust evaluation, "rip and replace" is a harder sell than "enhance what you have." The on-prem deployment model is appropriate for the industry's IP sensitivity requirements, but it multiplies operational burden for a two-person team.

The bull case I want to engage with honestly: Jordon Kashanchi's background is genuinely strong. Microsoft's Azure Maia custom AI silicon program, ARM RTL design, Intel graphics hardware -- this is someone who has lived inside the chip design pain point at production scale. That's the kind of founder-market fit I weight heavily. If you believe the "right architecture" matters more than first-mover traction -- and there are historical examples where it does -- then a technically excellent team building the fundamentally correct approach could overtake an incumbent that chose the wrong architecture. The EDA market is $15-20B and the AI segment is growing faster than the base. And semiconductor companies are structurally locked into needing better tools as chip complexity increases and engineer supply stays constrained. If Visibl's context-ingestion approach produces materially better design outcomes than ChipAgents' tool-integration layer, enterprise customers would eventually migrate.

But I keep running this through my single-miracle framework and the plan requires too many things to go right simultaneously. Miracle one: build an AI system that can meaningfully understand and act on heterogeneous chip design artifacts at production fidelity -- a hard technical problem where Cognichip's physics-informed foundational model approach may have structural advantages. Miracle two: convince semiconductor enterprises to adopt a standalone IDE rather than extending their existing Synopsys/Cadence workflow with ChipAgents. Miracle three: execute this with two people and YC-level funding against competitors with 37x more capital and established customer relationships. Compounding low-probability events multiply in the wrong direction. I also note the CEO's background is software and data at Deloitte, not semiconductors -- when you're selling to VP of Engineering at Qualcomm or Broadcom, the person leading the relationship needs domain credibility that semiconductor engineers recognize.

This is a real market at a real structural moment with a CTO who has real domain depth. But the structural moment is consensus, not non-obvious. The competitive landscape has already crystallized around well-funded leaders. And the path to winning requires sequential breakthroughs in technology, distribution, and capitalization. I pass.
