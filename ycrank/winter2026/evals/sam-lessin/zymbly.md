# Zymbly -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's what's striking about Zymbly: the team is almost absurdly credentialed for this exact problem. Robbie Bourke ran aircraft maintenance at Virgin Atlantic, designed aircraft at Airbus, built Oliver Wyman's aviation practice over 25 years. Ben Jacob did airline operational transformation at Oliver Wyman and then led Applied AI at a Google-backed company. They all came out of the same firm, meaning these relationships have genuine depth -- not a speed-dating co-founder match. When I evaluate the "sane" half of my framework, this is about as good as it gets at pre-seed. Bourke doesn't just understand the buyer -- he WAS the buyer. He's walked hangar floors. He knows what kills a technician's productivity because he managed hundreds of them. That's not founder-market fit you can pitch your way into; that's lived operational credibility.

The problem is the "insane" half. When I look at what they're actually building -- a voice-first AI copilot that sits on top of existing ERPs to help technicians query manuals and draft documentation -- I don't see an insane idea. I see the most obvious possible application of large language models to a manual-heavy workflow. CAMP Systems shipped an AI Operations Manager in October 2025. EmpowerMX launched EMX Vision in 2023. Every legacy MRO vendor on earth is adding AI features to their existing platforms right now. This is not a bet that other investors think is crazy. This is a bet that every investor and every incumbent finds completely logical. Sane person, sane idea -- and that's exactly the calibration I avoid, because the returns are already priced into the consensus.

Run my "cherry on top" test: would Zymbly be a good business if AI didn't exist? The answer is unambiguously no. Without LLMs, without voice-to-text, without RAG over maintenance manuals, there is no product. AI isn't the cherry on top -- it's the sundae, the bowl, and the spoon. The dossier itself acknowledges this honestly: "The core technology -- RAG over maintenance manuals, voice-to-text, and document generation -- uses widely available AI building blocks." When I see that sentence, I see a feature waiting to be absorbed by incumbents with distribution. CAMP has 1,500+ service centers and 45 years of relationships. Ramco serves 4,000+ aircraft. These are exactly the companies positioned to ship an AI copilot feature into their existing installed base -- they don't need to rip and replace anything, they just need to add a module. Zymbly's "easy adoption, no rip-and-replace" positioning is a double-edged sword: low switching costs going in means low switching costs going out.

The strongest bull case -- and I want to engage with it honestly -- is that aviation maintenance is structurally different from typical enterprise software markets. The regulatory environment (FAA, EASA, CAA) creates genuine friction. Trust in safety-critical AI is earned over years, not months. Bourke's personal relationships could unlock design partnerships that cold-calling AI startups never get -- and they already have one with a major global airline. The 43,000-technician shortage by 2027 creates real urgency. If Zymbly gets deeply embedded in a few major airlines' compliance workflows before incumbents ship their own AI modules, the switching costs could compound faster than I'm giving them credit for. And if they accumulate proprietary data on troubleshooting patterns across multiple airline deployments, that data flywheel could become genuinely defensible. The regulatory moat story has some real teeth -- aviation regulators haven't even issued guidance on AI-generated maintenance documentation yet, and whoever helps write those standards could lock in structural advantage. If I squint, this looks more like my Craftwork thesis than my typical AI wrapper pass -- domain operators using technology to amplify work that software alone can't do.

But I don't think the analogy holds. Craftwork has painting crews. Metropolis has installed parking hardware. Those businesses have physical operations that software amplifies but cannot replace. Zymbly has software. Excellent, domain-informed, regulation-aware software -- but software. The technicians aren't Zymbly's employees. The hangars aren't Zymbly's assets. The regulatory alignment is real but it's compliance pre-work, not a structural moat -- and it's the same compliance work CAMP and Ramco will do with their vastly larger teams and existing regulatory relationships. The narrative ceiling is also constrained: aviation MRO technician productivity tools is a real market but not an "infinity story." You could stretch it to all regulated field technician work, but that expansion requires re-proving the product in entirely new regulatory regimes, which is essentially starting over.

The team deserves a better structural setup than this. Bourke's 25 years of aviation credibility, Jacob's AI operations chops, Habibullah's quantitative depth -- this is a founding team that could build something genuinely non-consensus in aviation or aerospace. But an AI copilot for maintenance documentation is the most consensus application of AI to this industry imaginable. I'd be more interested if they were using Bourke's network to build something structurally weird -- a new compliance protocol, an MRO marketplace with operational skin in the game, something that makes other investors uncomfortable. What they're building instead makes every investor nod approvingly, and that's precisely the signal I've learned to avoid.
