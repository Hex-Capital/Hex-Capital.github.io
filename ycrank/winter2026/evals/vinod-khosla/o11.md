# o11 -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is precisely the kind of company I describe when people ask what I pass on. Investment bankers build pitch decks and financial models faster. Private equity analysts run due diligence more efficiently. Wealth managers generate client deliverables with less manual effort. If o11 captures every dollar of this market -- every single one -- the world still has investment bankers doing the same work, just with shinier tools. The consequence of success is a vertical SaaS business selling seats at $20-200/month to finance professionals. Nobody's life fundamentally changes. No industry gets restructured. The founders have identified a real pain point and narrowed their ambition to a manageable niche -- which is exactly how you reduce the probability of failure to the point where the consequence of success becomes inconsequential. These are clearly capable young people, and I'd tell them directly: you're too talented to spend your twenties making PowerPoint faster for people who already make $400,000 a year.

The competitive landscape tells you everything about where this sits on the ambition spectrum. Rogo has raised $165 million at a $750 million valuation with Sequoia and J.P. Morgan behind it. Hebbia has $161 million and $13 million ARR. AlphaSense has raised $1.39 billion. And then there's Microsoft itself, which generated $25.5 billion in cloud revenue last quarter and owns the platform o11 depends on. When the incumbents and well-funded startups are already swarming a space, you're not skating to where the puck will be -- you're arriving after everyone else and hoping to find an uncovered patch of ice. The experts aren't dismissing this approach as impossible; they're already building it with a hundred times more capital. That's the opposite of the signal I look for.

The strongest bull case rests on the founders themselves, and I'll engage with it honestly. Ajay Misra led AI at Cal AI, a product that reached 10 million users and $40 million ARR -- that's real product-scaling experience, especially for someone his age. At 19-20, both founders dropped out of college to build this. That's the kind of irreverence I respect. The M365 add-in approach could theoretically be a wedge: own the workflow layer for financial professionals, then expand into replacing entire analyst functions. If these founders demonstrate the learning rate I look for -- if they evolve their thinking over the next year and realize the real opportunity isn't making Excel slightly smarter but fundamentally reimagining how capital allocation decisions get made -- then the team could be worth betting on for a different company. But today, the product they're building is an incremental improvement to an existing workflow, sold into a market where their competitors have two hundred times their capital and established enterprise relationships including backing from the very banks they're trying to sell to.

The technology layer reinforces my concern. M365 add-ins, financial data connectors to PitchBook and Capital IQ, LLM-powered document generation -- none of this creates structural disruption. The AI capabilities are commoditized across multiple model providers. The data connectors require API agreements but aren't exclusive. The "zero context limits" claim for multi-document analysis is technically interesting but not proprietary -- every serious AI company is expanding context handling. More fundamentally, this technology augments Microsoft's platform rather than replacing it, which means o11's entire existence depends on Microsoft's continued tolerance. Microsoft could restrict third-party add-in APIs, build vertical financial features into Copilot, or acquire a competitor tomorrow. Building your company as an add-in inside the incumbent's ecosystem is the architectural expression of incremental thinking -- you've accepted the incumbent's frame and are optimizing within it rather than making it obsolete.

What only I notice here is the mismatch between outsider energy and insider ambition. I love backing outsiders -- Peter Beck had no aerospace pedigree, Pat Brown had never worked in food. But those outsiders were attacking problems where the consequence of success was civilization-scale: affordable space launch, eliminating animal agriculture. These founders are outsiders to investment banking, which could be an advantage if they were reimagining capital markets from first principles. Instead, they've accepted the existing workflow -- bankers use Excel, PowerPoint, Word -- and are making it marginally better. An outsider who adopts the insider's frame loses the outsider's advantage. The domain expertise gap that the dossier flags as a risk is actually the less important problem; the real issue is that even deep domain expertise wouldn't change the fact that the problem they've chosen has modest consequences at scale.
