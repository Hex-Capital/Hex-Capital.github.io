# Hlabs -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The most striking feature of HLabs is its structural dependency on a tariff -- specifically, a 145% levy on Chinese imports that nearly tripled the landed cost of foreign robotics components. This is not a technology thesis; it is a trade policy thesis. The company's core value proposition is geographic provenance: the same class of product (FOC motor controllers, control boards) that ODrive, moteus, and RobStride already produce, manufactured on American soil instead of Chinese soil. When I ask my question -- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" -- the answer here would be something like "U.S. robotics teams need domestic component suppliers." But this is not a secret. It is the front page of every trade publication in 2025. Every robotics founder in America is acutely aware that their Chinese BOM got vastly more expensive. A thesis that every participant in the market already holds cannot generate monopoly returns, because every rational actor will move to fill the gap simultaneously.

The competitive landscape confirms this diagnosis. ODrive makes general-purpose motor controllers. Moteus offers open-source brushless servo controllers. HEBI Robotics sells modular actuator systems. RobStride builds integrated actuator modules in China. HLabs enters this field as a fifth player offering a $35 control board with open-source firmware. This is the Girardian pattern at its most direct: multiple players converging on the same customers with similar products, differentiated primarily by price and geography. The open-source firmware strategy, while intelligent for developer acquisition, actively undermines any proprietary technology moat. You cannot simultaneously give away your software and claim a monopoly on the technology layer. The result is a components business competing on manufacturing cost and supply chain reliability -- a business that trends toward commodity margins, not monopoly profits.

The technology itself is competent engineering, not a discontinuity. FOC motor control has been well-understood for decades. A $35 actuator control board is a good price point, but it is not an order of magnitude better than what exists -- it is a competitive offering in an existing product category. Nothing here makes the prior approach obsolete. ODrive could match this price. A well-funded American hardware startup could replicate the manufacturing. There is no moment where you look at HLabs and say "this capability simply did not exist before they built it." This is 1-to-n work -- reproducing and marginally improving what already exists, manufacturing it domestically, and relying on tariffs to create the price differential. When Stripe built their payments API, no developer tool remotely comparable existed; the experience was a genuine order-of-magnitude improvement. HLabs' control board is a good product entering a populated field.

The strongest bull case is worth engaging seriously. If U.S.-China decoupling is permanent and structural -- not a political cycle but a civilizational realignment -- then being the first to build a vertically integrated domestic robotics supply chain is genuinely valuable. The defense angle is real: ITAR restrictions are not policy whims but statutory requirements, and defense robotics must source domestically regardless of tariff levels. Hetherington's product roadmap -- control boards expanding to Jetson-powered main boards, camera systems, wireless modules -- sketches an ecosystem play where switching costs compound as customers integrate multiple products. Forty companies ordering in four months is genuine pull. If Hetherington executes and becomes the default domestic stack for American robotics startups, the switching costs could eventually resemble what Palantir built through deep government integration. The CHIPS Act and reshoring incentives provide tailwinds that transcend any single administration. This is a scenario where the "picks and shovels" provider to a booming industry builds a quietly dominant position -- not through breakthrough technology, but through manufacturing execution and ecosystem breadth.

But that scenario requires several things I do not see evidence for. It requires that tariff protection persists long enough for HLabs to build scale advantages before competitors -- including well-capitalized incumbents like Parker Hannifin or Bosch Rexroth -- enter the same domestic manufacturing space. It requires a solo founder to simultaneously design four product lines, manage manufacturing, build supply chains, handle quality assurance, and sell to defense procurement channels. Paul Hetherington has relevant credentials -- his MEng in integrated mechanical and electrical engineering is precisely the right background, and his hands-on PCB design and firmware work demonstrate real capability. But his previous company, Mystic AI, ran for six years through YC W21 and wound down without a clear exit, which is not disqualifying but raises questions about the pattern. More fundamentally, hardware companies with ambitious multi-product roadmaps and a single person do not scale. The execution requirements are multiplicative, not additive.

The company occupies an uncomfortable middle ground: a real market need served by a competent founder, but without the contrarian insight or technological monopoly that separates extraordinary investments from merely reasonable businesses. The "secret" is consensus. The technology is existing. The moat is a tariff. I look for companies that would win even if the policy environment turned hostile, because their technology is so superior that no alternative is viable. HLabs wins only if the policy environment remains favorable and competitors fail to execute -- which is a bet on circumstance, not on structural dominance. This is a components business in a competitive market, not a monopoly built on a secret about the world.
