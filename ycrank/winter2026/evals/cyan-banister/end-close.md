# End Close -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's the thing that stands out to me about End Close before anything else: this is a company built from professional mastery, not from personal obsession. Sean Bolton spent six years at Modern Treasury constructing the reconciliation infrastructure that handled over a trillion dollars in annual payment volume. That's genuinely impressive engineering leadership. But when I think about whether I'd write a check from my own money, my first question is always the same -- tell me how you got here, and I don't mean your LinkedIn timeline. I mean what happened in your life that made this problem yours to solve. What I see with Sean is someone who's exceptionally qualified, who knows the edge cases and the failure modes at scale, who could probably build this system better than almost anyone. But the biographical thread connecting founder to mission feels occupational rather than existential. The same applies to David Newell -- strong engineering pedigree across Intercom, Basecamp, PostHog, a prior YC company that didn't make it -- but no signal that reconciliation infrastructure is the hill either of them would choose to die on. I've learned that the founders who persist through the darkest moments are the ones who can't walk away because the problem is woven into who they are, not just what they've done professionally.

The competitive landscape here is what really gives me pause, because it tells me something important about where this company sits on the consensus-conviction spectrum. BlackLine is doing $685 million in ARR. FloQast just raised $292 million and is shipping AI agents for financial close. Modern Treasury -- Sean's former employer -- has its own reconciliation product and recently announced AI-assisted features. Multiple well-funded companies are converging on the same insight that reconciliation needs to be more automated and more real-time. That's not a company nobody else wants to fund because it sounds insane. That's a company entering a space where the thesis is already validated and the incumbents are already moving. The most promising companies I've backed were the ones where other investors looked at me sideways -- SpaceX when rockets were for governments, Crusoe when Bitcoin mining on gas flares sounded deranged. Reconciliation software with AI is the opposite of that. It's logical, it's well-understood, and every major player in the space is building toward the same destination.

I want to be honest about the bull case, because the domain expertise here is genuinely rare. Sean didn't just work on reconciliation -- he built the reconciliation organization at one of the most respected payments infrastructure companies in the world. His technical writing frames reconciliation as a knapsack problem, which tells me he thinks about this at the algorithmic level, not just the product level. If Modern Treasury's reconciliation is permanently bundled to its payment rails, there is a real gap for a standalone, API-first reconciliation layer that works across any stack. The "why now" around FedNow and real-time payments creating volume that breaks legacy batch systems is genuine. And David's experience building PostHog's error tracking product -- reportedly their fastest-growing feature -- suggests he knows how to build high-throughput data ingestion systems. If I squint, I can see a world where these two capture the reconciliation layer for the next generation of payments companies the way Stripe captured the payments API layer a decade ago. That's the version of this story that would give me a jolt of energy.

But I don't feel that jolt. What I feel is a competent team entering a competitive, well-understood market with an incremental improvement on existing approaches. This doesn't create economic access for people who lack it -- it creates operational efficiency for fintech companies and banks that are already well-resourced. It doesn't make an invisible system visible to the underserved -- it makes an internal operations system work faster for engineering teams at payments companies. These are valuable things to build, and they might make for a solid business. But they're not the kind of thing I write checks for with my own money. I'm looking for the founders and ideas that make other investors uncomfortable, that seem too strange or too hard or too early. End Close is none of those things. It's sensible, it's well-positioned, and it will find its investors -- but I'm not one of them.

The co-founder dynamic is the final piece I can't assess well from what's available. Sean and David don't share a prior employer or university, and I have no visibility into how they met or how they navigate disagreement. David's prior company Unflow shutting down isn't a dealbreaker -- plenty of great founders have a failed first attempt -- but combined with the domain shift from no-code mobile CMS to fintech reconciliation, I'd want to understand what drew him specifically to this problem. After HQ Trivia, I never skip this question. Without that signal, I'm left with a well-credentialed team in a competitive market solving a real but consensus problem that doesn't activate the part of my investing brain that has served me best.
