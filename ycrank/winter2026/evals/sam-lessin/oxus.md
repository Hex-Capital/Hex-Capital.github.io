# Oxus -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

This is the exact company I describe when people ask me what I don't invest in. An AI-powered version of an existing enterprise workflow -- internal audit automation -- where the entire value proposition collapses the moment you remove the AI layer. My test is brutally simple: would this business be good if AI didn't exist? Oxus without AI is nothing. There's no painting crew, no parking infrastructure, no wireless protocol, no physical operation that software merely amplifies. The software IS the business, and that's precisely the category where moats are evaporating fastest. AuditBoard already has 2,000+ enterprise customers and got acquired for $3B+. Workiva does $739M in revenue. Both are actively bolting AI features onto their existing platforms. When incumbents with that kind of distribution add "good enough" AI capabilities -- and they will, because the underlying LLM technology is commoditizing in real time -- what exactly is Oxus's defense?

The sane-person-insane-idea calibration fails on the idea side, not the person side. Three MIT graduates with backgrounds spanning the Fed, D.E. Shaw, JPMorgan, and BCG -- these are clearly smart, credentialed people. I don't doubt their competence. But "AI for SOX audit workflows" is not an insane idea. It's the most obvious idea in enterprise compliance right now. Fieldguide already raised $125M building AI-native audit tools. Denki is in the same YC batch pursuing a similar use case. When I backed Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, the idea sounded genuinely crazy to most of Silicon Valley -- a regulated cryptocurrency exchange when Bitcoin was a punchline. When I backed Teamshares, buying hundreds of small businesses through employee ownership seemed operationally absurd. "Let's use LLMs to automate audit paperwork" is what every consulting firm partner has already thought of in the shower. That's a sane person with a sane idea, which in my framework is the worst configuration for outsized returns because the market has already priced in the opportunity.

The moat analysis here reads like a cautionary tale from my "SaaS is over" essay. Every claimed defensibility -- workflow switching costs, accumulated audit data, domain-specific prompt engineering -- is a software moat, and software moats are dissolving. The dossier itself acknowledges the commoditization risk plainly: "The core technology (LLM-based document analysis and generation) is accessible to any team with AI engineering capability." That's not me being provocative; that's the company's own competitive analysis. The audit-cycle switching cost argument has some weight -- you don't rip out compliance tooling mid-year -- but that same switching cost works against Oxus too, because it means audit teams are locked into their existing AuditBoard and Workiva instances and face enormous friction adopting anything new, especially from a three-person pre-seed startup asking them to trust AI-generated outputs in a domain where errors trigger material weakness findings.

Here's the strongest bull case, and I want to engage with it honestly: SOX compliance is mandatory, the CPA talent shortage is structural and accelerating, and the incumbents are architecturally constrained. AuditBoard and Workiva were built as workflow tracking and reporting platforms -- fundamentally different from AI-native output generation. Rebuilding from scratch would cannibalize their existing revenue. There's a real window where a purpose-built AI-native tool could deliver dramatically better audit deliverables than what incumbents can bolt onto legacy architecture. And Oxus's focus on in-house audit teams is a genuinely different buyer persona than Fieldguide's CPA firm clients. If the team can land five to ten mid-market public companies before incumbents close the gap, the annual audit cycle creates natural retention. That's a real wedge. But it's a wedge that requires winning enterprise sales against entrenched incumbents with a three-person team and no disclosed revenue -- an execution challenge that turns what might be a reasonable opportunity into a venture-return-unlikely outcome. The structural logic points toward this becoming a feature inside AuditBoard rather than a standalone platform.

Nothing about this company creates a new primitive or protocol. Oxus doesn't establish infrastructure that other businesses build on. It's an application sitting on top of OpenAI's or Anthropic's models, processing documents in a specific domain. The narrative ceiling is "AI for all audit and compliance work," which is a real market but not an infinity story -- it's bounded by the number of companies that need compliance and the willingness of those companies to pay for tooling versus hiring. Compare that to Helium building decentralized wireless infrastructure or Venmo creating a peer-to-peer payment primitive, where each new user makes the network more valuable for everyone else. Oxus has no compounding dynamic. Each new customer is a linear sale.

I pass. The founders deserve credit for targeting a real pain point with genuine domain awareness, but the structural logic runs against every dimension of my framework. AI-first product with no AI-resistant moat, SaaS business model in a category I believe is dying, application-layer positioning with no path to becoming infrastructure, consensus idea in a market where a $700M competitor already exists, and no disclosed revenue or customer commitments providing a downside cushion. Smart people, wrong structure.
