# Lucent -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

I need to be transparent about something upfront: Long Journey Ventures is listed among the pre-seed investors here. That said, I'm going to give you my honest read based on what's in front of me, because that's the only way this exercise has value. And here's what strikes me most: the pivot. Lucent raised $1.3 million in 36 hours for a company building the data layer for browser agents -- collecting interaction data to train AI for form-filling and flight booking. That was the weird version. That was the version I'd have leaned into at the pitch. Somewhere between October and January, it became "AI that watches your session replays to detect bugs." The founder moved *toward* consensus, not away from it. In my experience, that directional shift -- from a genuinely unusual data infrastructure play to an AI feature layer on top of existing developer tools -- is the opposite of the signal I trust.

Alisa Rae is clearly a talented builder. Multiple products shipped by 22, a founding engineer role at MagicBrief before Canva acquired it, her own exit with Stella AI, a stint at Atlassian working on the editor that powers Jira and Confluence. She got rejected by YC as a solo founder and came back. That takes real nerve. But when I ask the question I always ask -- tell me your story, not the business -- what I'm listening for is the biographical thread that makes this founder *inseparable* from this problem. Stella AI had that: she was a tutor, she built an AI tutoring platform. The connection was embodied. Here, the connection is professional adjacency -- she worked at a big developer tools company and noticed the session replay gap. That's a valid observation, but it's not the kind of forge-tested commitment I've learned to trust when everything inevitably goes sideways. She hasn't lived through the pain of watching thousands of session replays and feeling the futility of it in her bones. She identified a market gap, which is different from being haunted by a problem.

The competitive landscape is what concerns me most. Sentry has already shipped Replay AI Summaries. Quantum Metric launched Felix AI with Gemini 1.5 Pro. FullStory and LogRocket have the session data, the customer relationships, and the engineering teams to build this as a feature update on a Tuesday afternoon. This isn't like SpaceX where nobody else was crazy enough to try private rocketry, or Contraline where the stigma of male contraception kept VCs away. This is developer tools plus AI -- the single most consensus category in 2026. Every well-funded incumbent is already heading exactly where Lucent wants to go. The core capability, applying LLMs to analyze visual session data, is technically reproducible by anyone with access to the same foundation models. I don't see the moat. I don't see the regulatory complexity that would create one. I don't see the data flywheel that couldn't be replicated by a company that already has ten thousand times more session data.

Let me steelman the bull case, because it deserves a fair hearing. If Alisa can build a detection engine that is genuinely, measurably superior to what incumbents bolt on -- not summarization, but actual proactive bug discovery across every single session -- and if she can integrate with LogRocket, Sentry, and FullStory simultaneously as a neutral analysis layer that sits across all of them, there's a wedge. The incumbents might not build for interoperability with each other. A startup that works with everyone's replay data could own a horizontal position the incumbents won't cede to each other. And Alisa's track record suggests she ships fast and iterates well. If the detection quality creates genuine word-of-mouth among engineering teams -- the kind of organic pull that makes developers tell other developers -- this could work despite the competitive pressure. That's the path.

But it's not my kind of bet. The idea isn't unpopular or difficult to assess -- it's legible and logical, which in my framework means the opportunity has already been partially arbitraged by the time it becomes obvious. There's no economic access angle for underserved populations; this is a productivity tool for well-compensated software engineers at companies that already pay for session replay infrastructure. The space isn't regulated or stigmatized in ways that create natural barriers to entry. And the founding story, while impressive for its velocity, doesn't carry the biographical weight I've learned to require. When I backed Uber, I'd spent years talking with my husband about the medallion system and feeling outraged by it. When I wrote my first check to SpaceX, Elon's intensity about making humanity multiplanetary was visceral and unmistakable. I'm not feeling that biographical inevitability here. I'm seeing a sharp young engineer who spotted a logical market gap -- and many investors would rightly find that compelling. But my portfolio is built on backing the founders that other people think are crazy, solving problems that other people think are unsolvable, in categories that other people won't touch. Lucent doesn't trigger any of those signals for me.
