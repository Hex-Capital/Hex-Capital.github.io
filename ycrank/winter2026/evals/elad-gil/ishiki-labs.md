# Ishiki Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the competitive landscape, and it's not encouraging. AI meeting assistants is one of the most consensus-hot categories in enterprise software right now. Otter.ai has $100M ARR and 25M users. Fireflies.ai hit a $1B valuation. Read.ai raised $81M. Granola raised $67M. Microsoft Copilot already provides real-time meeting assistance natively inside Teams. This is not a "too boring" or "too niche" market that other investors are overlooking -- it's a market where every enterprise AI investor has already placed multiple bets. When I look at the TAM slide ($3.5B growing to $34B at 25% CAGR), that's exactly the kind of consensus market sizing that should make you nervous, not excited. The structural moment here -- foundation models crossing latency thresholds for real-time multimodal processing -- is real, but it's generic. Every AI meeting company, and every foundation model provider, is riding the same wave. There's no non-obvious angle I can identify.

The founders are the strongest element of this company, and they deserve genuine credit. Amit Yadav worked on Meta's LLaMA team training multimodal LLMs and in Reality Labs training video assistants for smart glasses. Robert Xu spent four years building orchestration systems for running multimodal assistants on Meta's smart glasses, including Orion, optimizing for latency and compute. These two didn't read about real-time socially-aware AI in a blog post -- they built it at one of the most well-resourced labs in the world. Amit's 20+ publications at CVPR, NeurIPS, and ICASSP demonstrate research depth. The combination of ML research and production systems engineering is directly relevant. Founder-market fit is genuinely strong here.

But founder-market fit alone doesn't overcome a structural market problem, and the structural problem here is severe. The core differentiation -- "knowing when not to speak" -- is a single feature dimension, not a platform. When I apply the product-to-distribution test, I struggle to see how Fern becomes a distribution channel for additional products. Stripe's payment API created a developer relationship that naturally distributed Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. Figma's design tool created a collaborative environment that naturally expanded to FigJam. What additional products does a socially-aware meeting copilot distribute? The product is doing one thing -- contextual silence with on-demand assistance -- and that one thing could be replicated as a feature toggle by any incumbent or platform owner. A "do not disturb" mode on Otter.ai, combined with their existing transcription data and 25M user base, narrows the differentiation gap substantially.

The bull case would require believing that social awareness in AI is a durably hard technical problem -- that foundation model providers won't solve it natively within their voice assistants, and that meeting platforms won't integrate it. If "conversational social intelligence" turns out to be a persistent capability gap requiring specialized models trained on proprietary interaction data, then the Meta smart glasses experience gives these founders a genuine head start. There's a version of the boomerang pattern here: Meta invested billions building socially-aware AI for smart glasses but couldn't deploy it at scale because glasses adoption is premature. Ishiki Labs deploys the same capability through video meetings, which 300M+ people already use daily. If that technical moat holds, and if they can accumulate proprietary training data from real meeting interactions faster than incumbents can retool their transcription-first architectures, there's a path to a real company. But that path requires multiple things to go right simultaneously.

And that's where the single-miracle test fails. I count at least three sequential breakthroughs needed: first, achieving social awareness quality good enough that professionals trust the AI to sit silently in sensitive client meetings; second, building distribution against incumbents who have tens of millions of users and years of data; third, avoiding being commoditized by Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet adding native social awareness features. Three miracles multiply low-probability events. Compare this to Harvey, where the single miracle -- model fidelity for legal work -- was being delivered by foundation model labs, freeing Harvey to focus entirely on workflow and distribution. Here, the miracle that only Ishiki Labs can deliver (social awareness) is the one most likely to be commoditized, while the miracle they need externally (distribution) is the one blocked by entrenched incumbents.

I'm passing. The founders have exceptional credentials for building this product, but they're entering a consensus-hot market with narrow differentiation and compounding competitive threats. The best investments I've made have been in markets that triggered dismissive reactions from other investors -- markets that seemed too boring, too niche, or too weird. AI meeting assistants triggers none of those reactions. It triggers the opposite: "obviously huge market, everyone is investing." That pattern, in my experience, means the asymmetric returns have already been captured by the companies with $70-100M in funding and millions of users.
