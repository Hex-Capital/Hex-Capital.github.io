# Docura Health -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Docura Health isn't the product or the market -- it's what's missing from the founder's story. When I look at Akhil Sachdev, I see a UC Berkeley CS grad with solid tech internships at Rivian, Salesforce, and Cisco, and a prior startup called Siff AI that ran for about eight months before being discontinued. What I don't see -- and what I always look for first -- is the biographical thread that connects this person to this specific problem. How did a software engineer in his early twenties end up passionate about medico-legal report automation for workers' compensation physicians? There's no medical background, no legal experience, no story of watching a family member wait months for a disability claim to process, no personal encounter with the broken system he's trying to fix. That absence is significant to me because the founders who persist through the hardest parts -- and in a regulated space like this, there will be very hard parts -- are almost always the ones who are solving something that happened to them or someone they love.

The competitive picture here is the opposite of what gets me excited. AI-powered medical record review isn't a weird idea that nobody else wants to fund -- it's a well-capitalized category with Supio at $91 million raised, Wisedocs doing $14.4 million in revenue with 116 employees, DigitalOwl acquired by Datavant for enterprise distribution, and Stream Claims backed by Spark Capital and also out of YC. When I backed SpaceX or Crusoe Energy, nobody else wanted those deals. The investors who passed thought the ideas were crazy. Here, the smart money has already arrived and is scaling fast. The physician-facing positioning is a real differentiation -- most competitors serve lawyers, insurers, or claims adjusters -- but it's a segmentation strategy within a consensus category, not a contrarian insight that others have dismissed. I don't feel the jolt. I feel the crowding.

Let me steelman the case, because the physician-facing wedge deserves genuine consideration. If Docura Health can truly own the QME/IME physician workflow -- from medical record upload through AMA-compliant impairment rating to final report -- that's a defensible niche. The AMA Guides 5th and 6th Edition compliance is specialized, the regulatory requirements are state-specific and intricate, and physicians are notoriously sticky once they adopt a tool that saves them hours per case. The claim that users have "doubled their case volume" is meaningful if validated -- a physician doing twice as many evaluations is earning significantly more income. The HIPAA and AMA compliance surface area that creates risk also creates a moat against casual entrants. There's a version of this company that becomes the standard platform for medico-legal physicians across the workers' comp ecosystem, and that would be a real business in a $56 billion market. But even in this bull case, I'd want a founder who has walked through that regulatory complexity before -- someone who understands the administrative law judges, the state-specific DWC forms, the political dynamics of workers' comp reform -- and I don't see evidence that Sachdev has that domain depth yet.

What I uniquely look for -- whether a company creates economic access for people who currently lack it, or makes an opaque system transparent -- doesn't strongly apply here. The direct beneficiaries are physicians who perform medico-legal evaluations, already among the highest-compensated professionals in healthcare. There's a downstream argument that faster report generation accelerates settlements for injured workers waiting on disability determinations, and that's real human suffering being reduced. But Docura Health isn't making the workers' comp system transparent or giving injured workers agency -- it's making an existing professional workflow more efficient. That's valuable, but it's not the kind of structural impact that activates my conviction. Compare this to what Affirm did for credit transparency or what Flock Safety did for community safety data -- those companies fundamentally changed who had access to information and economic opportunity. This is a productivity tool for specialists.

The solo founder question is one I take seriously but don't automatically penalize. Some of my best investments have been founders who were utterly alone at the start. What concerns me more is that this is a solo technical founder building in a space that demands simultaneous expertise in healthcare regulation, legal compliance, physician sales, and AI engineering -- and the prior venture's eight-month lifespan raises questions about resilience through the long journey this particular problem requires. I'd want to understand what happened with Siff AI before forming a final view, but on the public evidence available, I'm not seeing the biographical grit or the domain-forged conviction that gives me confidence a founder will push through years of regulatory complexity and competitive pressure from players with ten to fifty times more capital.
