# Lexius -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that jumps out at me about Lexius isn't the product or the founders -- it's the competitive landscape, because it tells me something important about where we are in this category's lifecycle. Veesion has raised €53 million and deployed in over five thousand stores across twenty-five countries. Everseen has $113 million. Auror just raised an NZ$82 million Series C at a half-billion-dollar valuation. When I look at a space where multiple well-funded companies are already racing, with hundreds of millions in aggregate capital deployed, I know this isn't the kind of opportunity where I get to be the first check into something nobody else sees. The whole category of "AI shoplifting detection via existing cameras" has already been validated, priced, and competed. That's the opposite of what gets me excited. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Crusoe, Contraline -- were ones that other investors thought were absurd. Nobody thinks AI for retail theft is absurd anymore. Veesion is literally opening a U.S. office right now, in 2025, targeting the same market Lexius wants to own.

When I turn to the founders and ask my usual question -- tell me your story, not the business -- I see a gap that matters to me. David Elskamp built a six-figure media agency starting at fourteen, serving clients like Adidas and Heineken, and won "Most Entrepreneurial Student" at the University of Twente. That's genuine entrepreneurial drive, and I respect it. Liam Webster has a Berkeley EECS degree and did real AI and privacy research at ICSI, which is technically relevant. But neither founder has a biographical thread connecting them to retail theft, loss prevention, or even working in retail. Nobody here grew up watching their parents' bodega get stolen from. Nobody here spent years as a loss prevention officer watching CCTV feeds and knowing there had to be a better way. This looks like a smart team that identified a market opportunity through data science and entrepreneurial pattern-matching -- which is a perfectly valid way to start a company, but it's not the signal that makes me write checks. When the founder and the problem aren't woven from the same cloth, my experience says the founder is more likely to pivot away when things get brutal, because the problem is intellectual, not existential.

Now, here's what I want to be honest about, because the bull case is real: the FineFare deployment in the Bronx genuinely moves me. A twelve-thousand-square-foot grocery store saving $3,520 a month in prevented theft -- that's the difference between a small business surviving and closing. And this isn't some wealthy suburban chain; it's a Bronx grocery store, exactly the kind of business where theft can be existential. The promise of making enterprise-grade loss prevention accessible to SMB retailers who can't afford dedicated LP staff -- that pattern of democratizing access to tools previously reserved for large companies -- is the exact thing I look for. It echoes what Affirm did with transparent credit and what Thumbtack did connecting skilled tradespeople to customers. If Lexius could genuinely own the U.S. SMB retail segment, they'd be making an invisible system visible and protecting the livelihoods of small business owners who are disproportionately immigrants and minorities. That's a real economic access story, and it's the dimension where this company most fits my framework.

But I keep returning to the structural problem. The core technology -- behavioral detection via computer vision on commodity camera feeds -- is accessible to anyone with modern ML frameworks. Veesion already has the data moat from five thousand deployments that Lexius would need years to replicate. The founding date ambiguity bothers me too: if development started in 2022, with a Dutch customer (Coop Vandaag) and attendance at Slush 2023, then the traction achieved over three-plus years is modest. Four thousand stores "expressed interest" sounds impressive but interest isn't revenue, and I've learned the hard way that waitlists can evaporate when you ask people to pay. The privacy-first positioning is thoughtful -- excluding biometrics, analyzing only movement -- and Liam's research background at ICSI gives that credibility. But privacy positioning alone doesn't create the kind of deep regulatory moat I saw with Contraline navigating the FDA pathway or Anduril navigating defense procurement. Retail AI surveillance regulation is evolving but it's not yet the kind of hard barrier that keeps well-capitalized competitors out.

For this to be a great investment, you'd need to believe that the U.S. SMB retail segment is structurally different enough from Veesion's European enterprise market that Lexius can build an unassailable position before Veesion's U.S. expansion gains traction -- and that the plug-and-play, fifteen-minute remote installation creates enough of a distribution advantage to win on speed rather than data depth. You'd also need to believe that David's raw entrepreneurial energy and Liam's technical depth compensate for the lack of domain-specific biographical commitment. I can construct that narrative, but I don't feel the jolt. This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a crowded space, and the founder story doesn't give me the conviction to lean in when the consensus has already formed around the category.
