# Human Archive -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Human Archive isn't the team or the product -- it's that Scale AI, a company with $2 billion in annual revenue and a $29 billion valuation, launched its Physical AI division five months before this company entered YC. And Scale is already collecting over a thousand hours of robotics demonstration data per day through a global contractor network. On top of that, there are two other YC companies -- Sensei from S24 and Cortex AI from F25 -- working variations of the same problem. When I see four well-funded entrants racing into the same category within eighteen months, with VCs doubling their robotics investment to $7.2 billion, I know what this is: a consensus market forming in real time. And consensus markets are where I lose interest. The deals I've made my career on -- SpaceX, Uber, Crusoe -- were deals where people looked at me sideways. Nobody is looking sideways at "data infrastructure for robotics foundation models" in 2026. Every investor in the Valley already has this category on their radar.

When I try to find the founder story here -- the biographical thread that makes this team the inevitable people to solve this problem -- I come up mostly empty. I see four smart young people from Berkeley and Stanford who identified a real market gap. Samay Maini has genuine domain credibility through his ML engineering work at Contoro Robotics and his robotic perception specialization, and that matters. Raj Patel being a "former farmer" who ran a mango delivery operation and a fungicide startup gives him operational instincts for messy real-world logistics, which is actually relevant to deploying hardware across residential and manufacturing environments in Asia. But there's no hardship story that fuses the founder to the mission. There's no "I went through something that makes me unable to NOT solve this." These founders chose this problem from a menu of opportunities, and that's a fundamentally different energy than a founder who arrived at the problem because their life delivered them to it. I'm not saying they can't build something -- I'm saying my antenna doesn't pick up the signal I need.

The strongest case for Human Archive, and I want to be honest about it, is this: real-world data might be the irreplaceable bottleneck for embodied AI. Skild AI can generate billions of synthetic data points in simulation, but simulation has a well-documented reality gap -- robots trained purely in sim often fail in the messy, unpredictable physical world. If that gap proves durable, then the company that owns the largest, most diverse corpus of real-world multimodal demonstrations wins. Human Archive's approach of designing custom hardware and running its own collection operations, rather than relying on contractors or crowdsourcing, could yield meaningfully higher data quality and modality alignment. And the fact that they moved their entire operation to Asia shows a willingness to do what's hard and unglamorous -- hiring videographers and operations managers in India, deploying hardware in actual homes and factories. That operational grit is real. If I squint, I can see a version of this where the custom hardware becomes a defensible advantage that Scale's contractor model can't match, and the proprietary dataset becomes a reference standard. That's the path to something big.

But I keep coming back to the structural problems. The buyer set is tiny -- a handful of frontier labs like Physical Intelligence, Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, maybe Toyota Research. When your addressable customer list fits on a napkin, every customer has enormous negotiation leverage, and losing one account can crater your revenue. This is the opposite of the broad-based economic access plays I gravitate toward -- Uber created income for hundreds of thousands of drivers, Affirm served millions of borrowers. Human Archive serves maybe a dozen frontier labs. There's nothing wrong with that as a business, but it doesn't light up my framework for impact. And the four-person team, while young and apparently committed, has never scaled physical operations beyond selling mangoes and running a small biotech lab. The jump from that to deploying custom hardware across diverse environments internationally, with QA and annotation pipelines, while competing against a $29 billion incumbent -- that's a massive execution challenge with very little margin for error.

The co-founder dynamic is actually the brightest signal here for my framework. Raj and Shloke Patel have co-founded two companies together before Human Archive -- Mango United and Amaetheon Labs. That's a tested partnership, and after what I saw happen with HQ Trivia, I take tested partnerships seriously. But four co-founders is a lot of cooks, and I don't know how the Berkeley pair (Rushil and Samay) integrates with the Patel pair in terms of decision-making authority and conflict resolution. That ambiguity gives me pause rather than comfort.

This is a pass for me. Not because the market isn't real -- it clearly is -- but because everything about this opportunity screams consensus rather than conviction. The timing is popular, the category is validated, well-funded competitors are already operating at scale, and the founders, while capable, don't carry the biographical weight or domain obsession that would make me bet on them specifically against Scale AI's resources. I need to feel that jolt of energy, that sense that I'm seeing something others are missing. Here, I'm seeing what everyone else already sees.
