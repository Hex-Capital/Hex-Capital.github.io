# Visibl Semiconductors -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Visibl is the landscape around it. ChipAgents has $74M and 80 paying customers. Cognichip raised $33M. Synopsys.ai already has 5,000 active users at Tier-1 firms. Cadence just launched ChipStack AI Agent. This is not a space suffering from schlep blindness. Everyone can see the opportunity -- and more importantly, everyone is already running at it with real money. When I wrote about schlep blindness, the key insight was that obvious problems hide in plain sight because the unconscious mind filters out painful work. Payments were like that before Stripe -- thousands of hackers knew it was broken, but nobody wanted to deal with the banks. AI for chip design in 2026 is not like that. Over $100 million in venture capital has already poured into this exact problem in the last twelve months alone. The schlep is real -- on-prem deployment, IP sensitivity, byzantine EDA tool chains -- but it hasn't deterred anyone. That changes the calculus entirely.

Now, the CTO's background is genuinely interesting. Jordon Kashanchi designed silicon for Microsoft's Azure Maia custom AI chips. He did RTL design at ARM. He worked on graphics hardware at Intel. He has a BS and MS in electrical engineering from UT Austin, specializing in integrated circuits and computer architecture. This person has lived inside EDA tools. He knows the specific pain of interpreting ambiguous tool feedback, iterating toward tapeout, coordinating across design teams. If you asked me to design the ideal CTO for this company, you'd describe someone who looks a lot like Kashanchi. The organic connection between this founder and this problem is real -- on the CTO side.

The CEO side is a different story. Bryce Neil's background is software and data at Deloitte's OmniaAI team. He has a Verilog CPU-Design project on GitHub, which shows curiosity, but that's a learning project, not production chip design. Semiconductor companies are famously conservative buyers who respect domain credibility above almost everything else. When you're selling an AI-native IDE to teams designing chips at TSMC's latest nodes, the person across the table needs to speak their language. This isn't a fatal problem -- plenty of great companies have had non-domain CEOs -- but combined with no visible data on how the founders met, it raises questions. I've seen too many cases where co-founders who connected specifically to pursue an opportunity fell apart under pressure. The relationship needs to predate the startup idea, and there's no evidence either way here.

The strongest bull case goes something like this: ChipAgents and the other funded competitors are all building wrappers around existing Cadence and Synopsys tools. They're the equivalent of building payment plugins for PayPal rather than rebuilding the stack from scratch. Visibl's "AI-native IDE" approach -- ingesting full design context rather than bolting onto legacy tools -- could be architecturally superior in the same way Stripe's ground-up approach was superior to layering on top of existing processors. If that's true, then ChipAgents' 80 customers and $74M are building on the wrong foundation, and Visibl's 2-person team with the right architecture wins eventually. Semiconductor companies would pay enormous premiums for a tool that actually works, and on-prem deployment creates natural lock-in over time. If Kashanchi's firsthand experience with EDA tools led him to an architectural insight that the well-funded competitors missed, this could be the kind of company where a tiny team wins against giants because they made the right technical bet early. That's a real possibility. But it requires believing that the "AI-native IDE" framing represents a genuine architectural moat rather than marketing differentiation -- and I have no evidence either way on whether the product actually delivers something the competitors can't replicate.

What I keep coming back to is the category dynamics. My instinct -- and I wrote about this publicly -- is that the most impressive companies right now are not working on AI. When a category gets this hot this fast, the signal-to-noise ratio drops. Every smart technical person in semiconductors is thinking about AI agents for chip design right now. The idea doesn't fail the organic test for Kashanchi specifically -- he genuinely lived this problem -- but it passes the consensus test, which is almost as bad. In a world where five startups and two incumbents are all pursuing the same thesis, the winner is determined by execution and capital, not by insight. And a 2-person pre-seed team with no visible traction is not well-positioned to win an execution and capital race against a company with $74M and 140x ARR growth.

There's no evidence of users, revenue, waitlists, LOIs, or organic product adoption. No press coverage. No community. The auth portal at auth.visiblsemi.com suggests something exists, but at the level of observable user pull, I'm working with zero signal. At pre-seed I don't expect much, but in a space where a direct competitor already has 80 enterprise customers, the absence of any comparable traction data makes the competitive gap more stark, not less.
