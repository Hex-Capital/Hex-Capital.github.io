# SideKit -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I keep coming back to with SideKit: when I imagine describing this company to someone at dinner, nobody would say "that's insane." Nobody would laugh at these founders or tell them they're wasting their time on something impossible. And in my experience, that's not a good sign. The most promising companies I've backed -- SpaceX, Crusoe Energy, Contraline -- all provoked that reaction. People thought those founders were delusional. SideKit is the opposite: it's immediately legible, obviously useful, and completely reasonable. A lightweight SDK that bundles version gating, analytics, and feature flags for mobile developers. Sensible. Practical. And that very sensibleness is what tells me this isn't my kind of bet.

I want to give Ashish Selvaraj credit where it's due, because there is a real biographical thread here. He built Not Evil Sudoku, shipped it to 50,000+ installs, hit the wall of needing private analytics for his own app, and wrote about building the solution himself on Medium. Then he went through the "12 products in 12 months" challenge and came out the other side concluding that focused iteration on a single problem is what matters. That's a genuine itch-to-product journey, and it shows he understands the indie mobile developer's world from the inside. But when I ask myself the question I always ask -- "tell me your story, not the business" -- what I'm listening for is the hardship that forged an unbreakable commitment. The thing that means this founder will still be grinding on this problem in year five when Firebase has copied the version gating feature and LaunchDarkly has launched a free tier. A frustrating SDK experience is real, but it's not the kind of crucible that produces the persistence needed to compete against a $200M ARR incumbent and Google's free offering simultaneously.

The competitive landscape is what would keep me up at night here. Firebase Remote Config is free and already embedded in millions of mobile apps. LaunchDarkly has $330M in funding and $200M in ARR. Statsig was just acquired by OpenAI for over a billion dollars. Any of these players could add version gating as a feature in a single sprint -- it's not technically complex. SideKit's differentiation is bundling, not technology. And bundling as a moat has a short half-life when the individual components are well-understood and your competitors have engineering teams a hundred times your size. The switching costs are nearly zero -- swapping one analytics SDK for another is a few lines of code. This is a space where I don't see defensibility forming in the way I need it to.

To steelman the opportunity: if the explosion of AI-assisted coding tools really does produce a massive wave of new mobile app developers who need a dead-simple, one-stop production toolkit, SideKit could be perfectly positioned as the "just works" default for that generation. Think about how Stripe won developers not by having the most features but by having the best developer experience and lowest friction. If Ashish and Ethan can achieve that level of developer love in mobile production tooling, the bottoms-up adoption could be powerful. The pricing is aggressive enough to get people in the door. And the privacy-first angle becomes more valuable as regulation tightens. That's a real path -- but it requires winning a developer experience war against well-funded competitors in a space with no structural barriers to entry, and I don't see what makes these founders uniquely equipped for that fight beyond having felt the pain themselves.

What's missing for me, fundamentally, is the dimension I care about most after founder grit: does this company create economic access or make an invisible system visible? Uber created income for drivers. Affirm exposed hidden credit card fees. Carta made cap tables transparent. Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that lacked it. SideKit makes life marginally easier for mobile developers -- a population that is already among the most economically privileged workers in the world. That's fine, but it doesn't create the kind of positive-sum economic outcome that animates my investing. I'm not feeling the jolt.
