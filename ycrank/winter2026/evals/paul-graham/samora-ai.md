# Samora AI -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that immediately catches my eye about Samora is a tension I rarely see this cleanly. On one side: a founder who is blind, who spent years building accessibility technology across 80+ countries, whose entire professional life has been about making systems work for people that mainstream tech ignores — and who now builds multilingual voice agents for exactly those populations. On the other side: voice AI agents is possibly the single hottest funded category in AI right now, with competitors sitting on $25M to $200M+ in capital. The organic origin and the consensus category are both genuinely true at the same time. That's the puzzle.

Start with the origin. Kartik Sawhney didn't read a TechCrunch article about voice AI and decide to build a company. He's been living inside voice interfaces his entire life. When you're blind, voice isn't a feature — it's the product. He built I-Stem to serve 25,000 people with disabilities across 80+ countries, which means he's spent years navigating the specific linguistic and cultural complexity of making technology work in Hindi dialects, Arabic variants, and environments with limited connectivity. The path from that experience to "multilingual voice agents with dialect recognition and code-switching" is not a pivot manufactured in a brainstorming session. It's an organic continuation of a problem he's been solving for years. And the schlep here is real: building voice AI that handles a caller who starts in Marathi, switches to English mid-sentence, drops into local slang, and goes off-script — that's a problem engineers in San Francisco literally cannot see because they have never experienced it. This is genuine schlep blindness at work. The big voice AI companies are building for English-speaking enterprises. Making voice agents that actually work in Indian and Middle Eastern dialects requires data collection, cultural nuance, and local expertise that platform companies will deprioritize for years.

But I keep coming back to the competitive landscape, and it worries me. PolyAI has raised $200M and already supports 45 languages. Bland AI has $65M. Vapi has $25M. Synthflow has $30M. When I wrote that the most impressive YC companies right now aren't working on AI, this is why — categories where every VC firm is already excited have been priced accordingly. Samora's multilingual niche is real, but it's a niche within a consensus market, and well-funded competitors can expand language support faster than Samora can expand its enterprise footprint. The question is whether the managed-service model for emerging-market institutions creates enough switching cost and relationship depth to survive the inevitable onslaught.

The traction signals are interesting but murky. 1M+ calls processed is not nothing. Government of India, UNICEF, and Signify as named clients would be impressive for any pre-seed company — except that these relationships almost certainly flow from I-Stem, not from organic product-market fit for voice agents specifically. When your accessibility nonprofit has been working with the Government of India for years, getting them to try your voice AI product is a warm introduction, not a cold signal of demand. The real test would be clients who found Samora on their own, with no I-Stem connection, because the product solved a problem they couldn't solve otherwise. I don't see evidence of that yet. The $1.1M revenue figure from Getlatka is unreliable — the same number appears for unrelated companies on that platform. I'd want to see verified revenue before weighting it.

The bull case is that Samora has something the well-funded competitors genuinely lack: founders who have spent years in the field with the populations they serve. This isn't surface-level "we've done market research in India" — Kartik literally changed Indian education policy for blind students, built technology used across 80 countries, and managed Microsoft's $25M accessibility program. If the multilingual voice AI market develops the way the founders believe — where serving emerging-market institutions (governments, NGOs, large employers in India and the Middle East) becomes a significant revenue pool — then the competitors' English-enterprise focus would be a structural blind spot. The managed service model, where Samora runs voice operations rather than selling developer tools, could be the right wedge for organizations without engineering teams. And the co-founder team has worked together for years through I-Stem, which is exactly the kind of pre-existing relationship I look for.

What gives me pause beyond the competitive dynamics is the technical builder signal. I don't see public GitHub repos for any founder. The team is already 8 people. There's a Prompt Engineering Intern posting, which suggests the core technology may be assembly of existing models rather than deep technical work. Kartik has a Stanford CS master's and Vineeth was first engineer at a fintech startup — the credentials are solid. But credentials and building are different things. I want to see the founders who stay up all night writing code because they can't stop, and that signal is absent here. The backgrounds read more operational and advocacy-oriented than hacker-oriented. That matters in a category where the underlying technology is commoditizing rapidly and differentiation will come from technical depth, not relationship selling.

This is a genuine mixed signal. The organic origin is among the strongest I've seen in a voice AI company — most competitors in this space have manufactured origins. The schlep is real. The founders are impressive people with deep domain experience. But the consensus nature of the category, the reliance on I-Stem relationships for early traction, and the absence of visible technical builder energy push me toward caution. I'd want to see evidence that the product creates value independent of the founders' prior network before writing a check from my own money.
