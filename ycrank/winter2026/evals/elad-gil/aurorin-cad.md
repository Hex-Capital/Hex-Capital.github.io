# Aurorin CAD -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most interesting thing about Aurorin is that a solo founder has built a custom parametric B-Rep CAD kernel from scratch -- something that historically required teams of dozens working for years. Parasolid and ACIS, the kernels underneath virtually every professional CAD tool, were developed by large engineering organizations over decades. Michael Baron's background -- SpaceX propulsion simulation, Apple GPU drivers, and a four-year personal project building a multi-GPU graphics engine -- suggests he's one of a very small number of people who could credibly attempt this. The custom kernel is the strongest moat signal in the entire AI-CAD startup category. Zoo wraps its own geometry engine with a text-prompt interface. Hestus plugs into existing CAD tools. Adam AI does text-to-3D generation. None of them built the underlying engine from zero. That technical depth is genuinely impressive and not replicable by a team of generalists in a weekend. This is software-driven, not software-aware.

But when I ask my first question -- "what has changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this possible now?" -- the answer is weaker than I'd want. The legacy kernel problem has existed for twenty years. Engineers have been complaining about four-hour file load times in SolidWorks since the 2000s. The new variable is AI capability reaching a threshold where multi-step design automation becomes real, and GPU compute enabling modern kernel architectures. That's a legitimate structural shift, but it's the same "why now" that three other funded startups and every incumbent are citing. AI-native CAD is not a non-obvious market right now -- it's an actively forming category with Zoo at $10M raised, Adam AI at $4M, Hestus at $1.5M, and PTC launching an AI Advisor for Onshape in October 2025. When I look at my best investments, they were in markets that triggered dismissive reactions from other investors. Nobody is dismissing AI-CAD in 2026. The competitive landscape is forming fast.

My bigger concern is the miracle count. Building a production-quality CAD kernel that professional engineers will trust with real hardware designs is miracle number one -- and it's a substantial one even for someone with Baron's credentials. But professional mechanical engineers have years of design files in SolidWorks-native formats, STEP, and IGES. Full import/export compatibility with legacy file formats isn't a checkbox -- it's miracle number two, because getting the edge cases wrong in a manufacturing workflow can mean physical parts that don't fit. And if Aurorin targets aerospace or medical hardware companies (Baron's SpaceX background would make this natural), industry certification compliance -- ASME Y14.5, AS9100 -- is a multi-year process that constitutes miracle number three. Three sequential low-probability breakthroughs compound into a very difficult path. When I invested in Airbnb, the single miracle was marketplace liquidity. Everything else was execution. Here, I count at least three things that each independently could kill the company.

The strongest bull case is this: if the custom kernel works at production quality, Aurorin has the best platform moat in the category. A modern AI-native kernel could become the distribution channel for simulation, CAM integration, PLM workflows, and manufacturing planning -- the way Stripe's payment API became the distribution channel for Atlas, Billing, and Treasury. CAD is deeply embedded infrastructure that every hardware company must use, which fits my pattern of "boring but critical" tools that become platforms. The $12B market is real, growing at 6.4% CAGR, and ripe for architectural disruption. If Baron can hire a small team through YC's network and focus relentlessly on the kernel as the one miracle -- treating file compatibility and certification as phased execution problems rather than fundamental breakthroughs -- the company's technical foundation is more defensible than anything else in the category. The parallel to early Figma is tempting: a browser-based design tool seemed too narrow and too hard to build, but the architectural bet on a fundamentally new rendering engine turned out to be the entire moat.

But the Figma comparison also highlights what's missing. Dylan Field had Evan Wallace as a co-founder -- a technical counterpart who could share the kernel-level engineering burden while Field worked on product and distribution. Baron is alone, building a CAD kernel, an AI agent, and a desktop application simultaneously, with no public indication he's hiring. Solo founder risk on a project of this technical complexity is not a soft concern. Beyond the execution bottleneck, there's no evidence Baron has thought about distribution beyond YC's launch page asking hardware companies to try the free version. Founders who assume the product will sell itself on technical merit signal a gap in strategic thinking that worries me regardless of how impressive the engineering is. I'd need to hear Baron articulate how Aurorin becomes a distribution channel, not just a better tool.

The technology cycle positioning is reasonable but not uniquely early. Baron isn't building ahead of a capability curve the way Harvey built legal AI before GPT-4 existed. AI models capable of automating CAD workflows exist today, and multiple teams are racing to capture the market. Being one of four funded startups attacking the same structural opening is a different risk profile than being the only team that sees the wave coming. The timing is plausible, but there's no structural advantage in when Aurorin entered relative to its competitors -- Zoo has been building since 2023 with more capital.
