# Beyond Reach Labs -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The structural moment here is both the most compelling and most precarious I've seen at pre-seed. In January 2026, SpaceX filed with the FCC for a million-satellite orbital AI datacenter constellation. In February, Starcloud filed for 88,000 orbital datacenter satellites requiring 5 GW. Google announced Project Suncatcher. Collectively, these filings project a 500x increase in orbital power demand -- from roughly 20 MW today to 10 GW or more by 2030. If even 10% of that materializes, the market for deployable solar arrays transforms from a $250M niche into critical infrastructure for the next computing platform. That's the kind of adoption curve gap I've built my career identifying -- the distance between how a market looks today and where it's heading.

But here's the tension I keep returning to: every one of those demand drivers is a filing or announcement, not an operational system. When I tracked GPT scaling curves before investing in Harvey, I was extrapolating from measured capability improvements -- empirical data showing each model generation crossing new fidelity thresholds. Here, I'm being asked to extrapolate from corporate intentions. SpaceX has extraordinary execution credibility, but a million-satellite datacenter constellation is architecturally different from Starlink in every dimension -- thermal management, compute density, power requirements, and economics that nobody has validated. The "why now" is real in the sense that these filings didn't exist twelve months ago. It's speculative in the sense that nobody has proven orbital datacenters are economically viable at scale.

The founders are the strongest signal in this dossier, and they fit a pattern I recognize from defense and regulated hardware investments. Collins spent seven years at SpaceX, progressing to manage production engineering on the Crew Dragon parachute system -- human-rated flight hardware that safely returned NASA astronauts from the ISS. That's not resume padding; qualifying hardware that carries humans through atmospheric reentry is about as hard as aerospace engineering gets. Fogelson's PhD at CMU was specifically in mechanical metamaterials for deployable space structures, funded by a NASA NIAC grant, with the scissor-truss architecture validated in zero-gravity parabolic flights. They've known each other thirteen years, since freshman year at UPenn. This is the founder-market fit profile that matters in regulated hardware: people who've lived inside the problem, not tourists who noticed the sector getting attention. And $175M in LOIs at pre-seed is a commercial signal that's hard to dismiss entirely, even accounting for the non-binding nature of space industry letters of intent.

What concerns me is the miracle count. This company needs the in-space demonstration to succeed in Q2 2027, needs to survive multi-year qualification testing, needs to raise substantially more capital for manufacturing, needs to convert LOIs to binding contracts, and -- most critically -- needs the orbital datacenter market to actually emerge at sufficient scale. You could argue that technology validation is the single miracle and everything else is execution. I'd push back: the market materializing is itself an independent low-probability event on the timelines being projected. When I led Anduril's Series D, the defense budget was already $700+ billion annually with a structural vacancy after Google withdrew from Project Maven. The demand was allocated; the question was which company would capture it. Here, the projected demand is hypothetical. That distinction matters.

The Anduril parallel is worth exploring because Beyond Reach Labs shares the same structural DNA: capital-intensive hardware, qualification barriers creating moats for early movers, and an innovator's dilemma trapping the incumbent. Redwire has $304M in revenue and roughly 60% market share built on ROSA roll-out blanket architecture. Switching to a fundamentally different scissor-truss geometry would mean cannibalizing their existing product line and retooling manufacturing -- textbook Christensen dynamics. These are real advantages. But Anduril at its Series D had already demonstrated technology with DoD customers and had operational revenue. Beyond Reach Labs is pre-flight and pre-revenue, with a realistic path to meaningful commercial revenue that stretches five or more years. The structural pattern is similar; the de-risking level is entirely different.

The dimension where I have lowest conviction is product-to-distribution. Deployable solar arrays are a critical subsystem, but I don't see a clear path from selling power hardware to becoming a distribution channel for additional products. The strongest version of the story would be that controlling a spacecraft's power architecture gives you leverage to expand into integrated bus solutions, power management, or thermal systems. But nothing in the dossier suggests the founders are articulating this trajectory. Without a compounding distribution flywheel, this looks like a project-based hardware business -- potentially a very good one, but with structurally capped upside compared to platform companies.

If the orbital datacenter thesis proves out at anything near projected scale, this is one of the most consequential infrastructure bets available at pre-seed. The technology appears differentiated through years of PhD research, the founders are credible in ways that are genuinely hard to replicate, and competitive dynamics favor a new entrant over architecture-locked incumbents. But the distance between here and there involves too many sequential dependencies for me to commit my own capital today. I'd want to see the orbital demonstration succeed and at least one LOI convert to a binding contract before writing a check. This is a company I'd actively track and potentially invest at the next clear milestone.
