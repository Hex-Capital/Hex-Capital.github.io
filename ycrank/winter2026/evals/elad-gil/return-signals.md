# Return Signals -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The most analytically interesting thing about Return Signals is not the product -- it's the competitive structure of the market they're entering. Loop Returns has $176M in funding and 5,000+ merchant relationships. Narvar processes 74 billion consumer interactions annually through its IRIS AI layer. AfterShip is doing $85M in revenue. These aren't sleeping incumbents -- they're well-capitalized platforms actively adding AI capabilities. When I see a pre-seed company entering a market with three well-funded incumbents that already own the merchant relationships and are building AI features, I need to understand what structural force prevents them from simply adding "proactive SMS outreach" as a product toggle within their existing dashboards. The innovator's dilemma argument -- that incumbents can't cannibalize their per-return processing revenue -- has some merit, but it's weaker than it appears. Loop already positions itself as "exchange-first" and claims $2.4B in retained sales. They're already moving toward the same value proposition of converting returns to exchanges.

The "why now" for this company is generic LLM capability -- the same structural moment that every AI application company cites. That's categorically different from a Harvey-style timing thesis where you can point to a specific capability threshold (GPT-4 fidelity for legal work) that makes a previously impossible product possible for the first time. Could you have built a proactive SMS return concierge three years ago with rule-based flows? Yes -- it would have been cruder, but the core product concept doesn't require frontier AI. Multimodal photo troubleshooting for fit issues is more specifically enabled by recent model improvements, but that's one feature within the product, not the foundational capability. Returns management is not a non-obvious market. Everyone knows returns are an $850 billion problem. There are dozens of funded companies working on it. The specific angle -- proactive outreach before the return initiates -- is a clever product design choice, but a product design choice within a well-mapped market is not the same as a structural inflection point opening a market that didn't exist before.

The bull case deserves real engagement. Ilya Valmianski's technical background is genuinely impressive: SmartTriage at Kaiser Permanente processed 25M+ primary care encounters and is described as one of the largest patient-facing ML applications. That's production conversational AI at scale, not a research project. The pattern match from healthcare intake (patient describes symptoms, AI triages) to post-purchase concierge (customer describes dissatisfaction, AI redirects to exchange) is direct -- same architecture, different domain. If the claimed 70% exchange conversion rate holds at scale, the ROI for merchants is immediately quantifiable, which means sales cycles should be short. The Shopify ecosystem provides a natural distribution channel. And there's a version of this where the proactive SMS relationship becomes the wedge into broader post-purchase CRM -- you start with return intervention, then expand into upselling, cross-selling, loyalty, and review collection. If that expansion path works, this becomes a platform play rather than a point solution.

But that expansion path runs directly into Klaviyo, which already owns SMS marketing for Shopify brands, and Gorgias, which Return Signals already integrates with for customer support. The product-to-distribution trajectory is constrained on all sides by established platforms. More fundamentally, the initial product -- an outbound SMS conversational agent integrated with Shopify -- is technically reproducible by any competent team with access to LLM APIs and Twilio. The commoditization risk is real and acknowledged in the dossier. The potential data moat from proprietary post-purchase conversational patterns is theoretically valid but requires significant scale to become meaningful, and at pre-seed volumes, the data advantage is negligible.

The co-founder pairing raises a question I can't resolve from available data. Ilya's entire career is in healthcare AI -- Kaiser, Curai, MDandMe. Return Signals represents a full domain pivot to e-commerce. Neither founder has documented e-commerce or retail experience. Alejandro's BD background at Blueground and Nestpick (marketplace platforms) is relevant for partnership building but doesn't bring e-commerce domain knowledge. The trajectory of MDandMe -- founded February 2023, raised $2M in June 2023, then Ilya appears at a different company by 2025 -- suggests the prior startup didn't work out. That's not disqualifying, but the pattern of pivoting between domains (physics PhD to healthcare ML to e-commerce) without deep expertise in the current target market is a concern. The strongest companies I've backed had founders who lived inside the problem before trying to solve it.

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a well-understood market. The product insight -- proactive intervention rather than reactive processing -- is real but insufficient as a moat. The market lacks a structural inflection specific to this opportunity, the distribution trajectory is boxed in by adjacent platforms, and the competitive landscape includes incumbents with the resources and merchant relationships to replicate the approach. I'd need to see evidence that the 70% exchange conversion rate holds across multiple merchant cohorts with verifiable data, evidence that incumbents structurally cannot replicate this approach, and a more specific technology moat beyond "we're good at conversational AI" to move toward conviction.
