# Kita -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Kita: you have a Firestone Medal winner -- Stanford's highest honor for a CS thesis -- and a repeat founder who shipped features at Apple as an intern, and they've chosen to build document processing software for lenders. That's like giving a Formula 1 engine to a golf cart. The team's capability is dramatically miscalibrated to the ambition of the problem as they've framed it. Rhea Malhotra has published at ICRA, RSS, and Humanoids, has deep computer vision research credentials, and is building... a better OCR pipeline for Philippine bank statements. Carmel Limcaoco has the rare combination of Stanford technical depth and genuine Manila roots that could unlock something transformational in Southeast Asian finance. Instead, they're selling document extraction to existing lenders. These are exactly the founders I'd tell: you're too talented to spend your careers making a lending workflow 40% faster. Go build the lending infrastructure itself.

The consequence of success here is a good business, not a transformed industry. If Kita completely wins -- dominates document intelligence for every lender in Southeast Asia and Latin America -- what changes? Lenders process loan applications faster. More people get approved. That matters for financial inclusion, and I take financial inclusion seriously. But Kita captures a sliver of that value as a tool vendor sitting between the borrower's documents and the lender's decision engine. The global IDP market reaches $12 billion by 2030, BFSI is about a third of that, and Kita targets the emerging-market slice of that third. We're talking about a serviceable market measured in hundreds of millions, not billions. The downstream social consequence -- extending credit to the unbanked -- is significant, but Kita has positioned itself as the picks-and-shovels supplier rather than the entity doing the extending. Compare this to Square, which didn't just process payments faster but restructured who could participate in electronic commerce. Kita could be building the credit layer for emerging markets. Instead, it's building a feature for incumbent lenders.

The strongest bull case requires believing the wedge strategy expands far beyond document processing. If Kita's feedback loop -- linking document signals to repayment outcomes -- accumulates enough data, it could evolve into the credit scoring and risk infrastructure that every emerging-market lender plugs into. The Plaid of Southeast Asia, not just the Ocrolus. That outcome would matter. And the early traction is genuinely impressive: a six-figure paid pilot at prototype stage, customers across multiple Southeast Asian markets, 30% month-over-month growth, all with two people. That execution velocity tells me the founders can build and sell. The timing is also favorable -- VLMs just crossed the performance threshold needed for noisy emerging-market documents, and e-wallet adoption at 60% of Philippine transactions creates a new corpus of digital financial data that didn't exist five years ago. If I believed Kita would pursue the expansive vision rather than settle into a comfortable document processing niche, this evaluation would look different.

But the dossier describes a document processing company, and I evaluate what's presented, not what I wish the founders would attempt. The technology risk cuts both ways: VLMs are what makes Kita possible, but VLMs are also what makes Kita vulnerable. Foundation models are improving so rapidly that a well-funded competitor -- or even a general-purpose platform -- could replicate document extraction for emerging-market lending without Kita's multi-year localization effort. The defensibility argument rests on the lending-outcome feedback loop, which is genuinely novel, but it's early-stage and requires substantial volume to compound. Meanwhile, Ocrolus has $142 million in funding and could decide emerging markets are worth pursuing. Hyperscience has $439 million. Kita's hyperlocalization advantage is real but narrow -- it's a head start measured in months, not years, given how quickly modern models adapt to new document types.

What I notice that others might miss: this founding team has the profile I associate with outsiders -- a robotics researcher and a symbolic systems major, neither of whom came from lending or fintech. That's usually a signal I like. But they've applied their outsider perspective to build a tool that serves the existing lending system rather than to challenge it. The outsider advantage only compounds when directed at replacing the incumbent approach, not optimizing it. Carmel's Manila roots give genuine founder-market fit that no US-based competitor can replicate, and that's valuable. But founder-market fit in service of an incremental product is still incremental. I'd want to see these founders articulate why document processing is the beachhead for something that makes traditional emerging-market underwriting obsolete -- not just faster.
