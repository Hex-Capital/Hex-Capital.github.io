# SideKit -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the gap between the founder-market fit story and the depth of knowledge it actually represents. Ashish Selvaraj shipped Not Evil Sudoku to 50,000+ installs, got frustrated with the mobile analytics and version management tooling landscape, built his own private analytics service, and wrote about it on Medium. That's genuine lived experience -- he felt the pain in his own hands. But here's the question I keep coming back to: is this knowledge that can't be taught, or is this the observation every indie iOS developer makes after shipping their second app? "The tooling is fragmented, Firebase is creepy, LaunchDarkly is expensive" -- that's not a secret. That's a blog post waiting to happen for anyone who's been through the App Store submission cycle a few times. Compare this to the depth of understanding that made Stack Overflow inevitable -- Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood had spent a combined two decades understanding how developers actually learn and share knowledge, building on insights that couldn't be replicated by reading documentation. Ashish is smart and has real experience, but the insight here is shallow enough that a competent Waterloo classmate could arrive at the same thesis in a semester.

The leverage architecture is where this falls apart for me. SideKit is a bundling play -- take three things developers already have access to separately (analytics, feature flags, version gating) and put them in one SDK. That's a convenience improvement, not a new form of leverage. When I backed Replit, the thesis was that code itself could become accessible to millions of people who would never have called themselves programmers. That's leverage -- one platform creating an entirely new population of builders. SideKit doesn't enable anyone to do anything they couldn't do before. It saves existing developers some integration time and a few dollars. The difference between "ten minutes faster to set up" and "creates a capability that didn't exist" is the difference between a feature and a company.

The competitive dynamics here are brutal, and they illustrate exactly why bundling commodity components isn't a defensible strategy. Firebase Remote Config is free and already embedded in millions of apps. LaunchDarkly has $330M in funding and could add version gating in a sprint. Statsig was just acquired by OpenAI for $1.1 billion -- they have infinite resources to expand their feature set downmarket. The iOS SDK has 11 commits and 7 GitHub stars. When your differentiation is "we put three things in one package" and the largest company in mobile developer infrastructure gives away two of those three things for free, you're not building a moat. You're building a sand castle next to the ocean.

The strongest bull case would require believing that vibe coding tools -- Cursor, Replit Agent, Bolt -- are about to create a massive wave of new mobile app builders who are less technical than today's developers and who need radically simpler production infrastructure. If that wave materializes, and if those new builders don't default to whatever their AI coding tool recommends (which will likely be Firebase or the platform's own bundled infrastructure), and if SideKit moves fast enough to support Android, Flutter, and every other platform before someone else bundles the same three things -- then you could see a developer tools company riding a distribution wave to meaningful scale. The privacy-first positioning could also become genuinely valuable if App Tracking Transparency trends continue and developers start treating Google's analytics ecosystem as a liability. For this to work, though, you'd need the founders to demonstrate that they understand the distribution game at a level beyond "put it on GitHub and hope developers find it." I don't see that evidence yet.

Both founders are University of Waterloo CS students graduating in 2025. No red flags on integrity or long-term orientation -- Ashish's reflection that focused iteration beats spraying across twelve products shows genuine learning. But I don't see the technical depth that would make this compound over time. The individual components are well-understood. The bundling requires no novel algorithms, no proprietary data, no fundamental research. Every additional user makes the platform slightly stickier through historical data, but that's true of every analytics tool. There's nothing here that gets harder to replicate with time and use -- it's standard CRUD with a clean SDK wrapper. I want to back founders who know something the market doesn't know yet. These founders know something the market already knows and has chosen to live with.
