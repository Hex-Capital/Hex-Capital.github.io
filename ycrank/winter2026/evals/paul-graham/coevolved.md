# Coevolved -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the pivot trajectory. This company built a general-purpose multi-agent orchestration framework, open-sourced it, got 58 GitHub stars, archived it in January 2026, and then pointed the technology at mortgage origination. That sequence tells a story, and it's not the story I want to hear. They had a hammer and went looking for a nail. The idea didn't grow from some founder's miserable experience trying to close on a house or watching a loan officer drown in W-2 verification. It grew from a technology capability seeking a market. This is the exact inversion of how the best startup ideas emerge. Drew Houston didn't build a file syncing framework and then decide to apply it to forgotten USB drives. He forgot his USB drive and built Dropbox.

Mortgage origination is genuinely ugly work. The schlep is real -- state-by-state licensing, TRID compliance, CFPB oversight, document verification across dozens of formats, fair lending regulations. This is exactly the kind of painful complexity that causes smart people to unconsciously look away. If these founders had spent three years as loan officers watching colleagues manually cross-reference pay stubs against bank deposits, or if they'd built software at Blend and seen firsthand where the automation breaks down, I'd be much more interested. The problem passes the schlep test. The founders don't pass the organic discovery test. Neither Athan Zhang nor Alex Li has any documented experience in mortgage lending, financial services, or even adjacent fintech. When I ask "how did they find this problem?" the answer appears to be market analysis, not lived frustration. That's the failure mode I keep warning about -- intelligent people picking a category because it's large and manual, not because they've been living inside the problem.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. Both founders are genuine technical builders -- Princeton CS with NLP research under Danqi Chen, Five Rings quant internship, UW CS with distributed systems experience at Trade Desk. They can code. Athan Zhang previously co-founded Vytal and raised $1.2M, which shows he can build a product and get people to fund it, even though that was in an unrelated domain. And there's a legitimate "why now" argument: LLMs crossed a threshold in 2024-2025 that makes agentic document understanding feasible in ways it wasn't before. If they can learn the mortgage domain fast enough -- really learn it, not just read about it -- and if they can get embedded with a few lenders who let them see the actual workflow pain, they might build something good. The Collisons weren't banking experts when they started Stripe; they were hackers who'd experienced bad payment APIs. But that's the crucial difference -- they were at least users of the thing they were fixing. These founders weren't mortgage borrowers or loan officers whose lives were being eaten by document chasing.

The competitive landscape compounds my concern. Blend raised $685M and went public. Tavant powers one in three U.S. mortgage loans. Ocrolus raised $80M for document processing. Candor has patented underwriting automation. These aren't lazy incumbents asleep at the wheel -- they're well-funded companies already shipping AI features into mortgage workflows. When you're two people with no domain relationships attacking a market where incumbents have existing lender contracts and regulatory expertise, you need either a dramatically better product or a wedge they can't see. I don't see evidence of either yet. The company's differentiation claim -- agentic AI vs. workflow digitization -- is a technology architecture argument, not a user outcome argument. Lenders don't care about agent orchestration patterns. They care about whether loans close faster and cheaper without compliance risk.

What would make me change my mind? If these founders went and did the DoorDash thing -- literally sat in a loan officer's chair for three months, processed applications by hand, felt the pain in their bones, and then rebuilt the workflow from that lived understanding. Tony Xu delivered food himself, and that's why DoorDash eventually won despite being bottom half of the batch. The mortgage version of that would be apprenticing under a loan processor, seeing every failure mode, every compliance edge case, every borrower who abandoned an application because the document requests were confusing. If they did that and came back with a product shaped by firsthand operational knowledge rather than API documentation, this could work. The schlep is big enough that whoever actually solves it will build something very valuable. I'm just not convinced these are the founders who will get there, because they started from the technology rather than the problem.
