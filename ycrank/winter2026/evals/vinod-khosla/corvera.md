# Corvera -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

This is the archetype of a company that has reduced its probability of failure so effectively that the consequence of success no longer justifies the effort. If Corvera succeeds completely -- wins every mid-market CPG brand with over $5M in revenue, automates their entire order-to-fulfillment pipeline -- the result is a solid B2B SaaS business in a $12.5 billion software market. Nobody's food system changes. No trillion-dollar industry gets displaced. Retailers still operate the same way. Supply chains still move product through the same channels. The operational team at a tempeh brand processes orders without reading PDFs manually. I look at that outcome and I ask: is that worth four talented people spending the best years of their careers? The answer, by my framework, is no.

Christopher Kong is the textbook case of the industry insider I worry about. He ran Better Nature, got it into Tesco and Asda, lived the operational pain of a growing CPG brand, and concluded that the order processing was too manual. He's right -- it is. But that insight is precisely what I mean when I say experience gives you "a set of biases that prevent you from making mistakes but also prevent you from inventing." Kong knows exactly what's broken in CPG operations because he spent six years inside the system. That knowledge makes him excellent at optimizing the system. It also constrains him from imagining what replaces the system. Nobody who's been managing SKUs across warehouses wakes up and says, "the entire concept of physical retail distribution is about to become irrelevant." They say, "I wish someone would automate the purchase orders." The consequence of solving that problem is incremental, not transformational.

The technology here confirms my concern. The dossier itself states it plainly: "The underlying AI capabilities (LLM-based document parsing, time-series forecasting, workflow automation) are increasingly commoditized." Corvera is assembling off-the-shelf AI components into a vertical workflow tool. There is no deep technical moat -- no breakthrough in demand forecasting methodology, no novel data source, no proprietary model architecture. The differentiation is integration depth with CPG-specific formats and workflows. That's real work, but it's engineering execution, not technology disruption. Cin7 could bolt on agentic capabilities. Settle could expand from finance into operations. A horizontal AI automation platform could point itself at CPG. When your competitive advantage is "we built the integrations first," you're in a race, not a defensible position. Compare this to what Juniper did to Cisco -- Juniper didn't build a slightly better router, it built on a fundamentally different architecture (TCP/IP) that made Cisco's entire approach structurally obsolete. Corvera is building a better router.

The strongest case for this company would require believing that the "agentic OS" concept is a wedge into something much larger -- that autonomous operations for CPG is the beachhead for autonomous operations across all mid-market commerce, and that the company that solves this first in one vertical will expand to control the operational layer for every product-based business. If Corvera became the autonomous operating system for all physical goods companies -- not just CPG but apparel, electronics, industrial supplies -- that starts to look like a consequence worth pursuing. The team composition supports this ambition: Breeuwer's Google multi-agent systems background, Collins's product engineering from Princeton, Güngör's applied LLM specialization. And the traction -- 15 design partners and 50+ pipeline brands at pre-seed -- suggests the pain is real and customers are eager. The question is whether Kong and team are building toward that expansive vision or toward the more modest goal the dossier describes. Everything I see points to the latter: a vertical SaaS play targeting CPG brands above $5M, not a platform that reimagines how physical goods companies operate.

The timing on agentic AI is favorable -- 2025-2026 is the moment when autonomous workflow execution becomes reliable enough to deploy in production. But "AI will automate business workflows" is no longer a contrarian position. Seventy-one percent of CPG leaders have already integrated AI into at least one function. NVIDIA reports nine in ten retailers plan to increase AI budgets. This is consensus, not a bet ahead of the curve. When I invested in OpenAI in 2019, AI was laughable. When I backed cleantech in 2004, most VCs had never heard of the category. Corvera is arriving at the party alongside hundreds of other AI-native vertical SaaS companies, each claiming to automate a specific industry's workflows. The puck is already here; the question is whether there's room to skate.

I'm passing. These are talented people building a company that will probably work -- and that's exactly the problem. The probability of failure is low. The market is proven. The technology is available. And the consequence of full success is a mid-nine-figure SaaS business in a crowded vertical. I would tell this team: you have a Google AI lead, a Princeton CS engineer, and a founder who built a nationally distributed brand. You are too capable to spend your ambition on making purchase orders flow faster. Find the thing in the CPG value chain that terrifies incumbents and makes the current system obsolete -- not the thing that makes the current system 10x more efficient.
