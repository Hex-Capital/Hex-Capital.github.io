# Vela -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The first thing I notice is what's missing. Two clearly talented brothers -- Wharton summa cum laude, CMU CS in two years, AWS ML Supercompute, a stint at Perplexity, a microfinance organization they built across 77 countries starting at age 14. Impressive raw horsepower. But when I ask my primary question -- what do these founders know about scheduling that can't be taught in a classroom or replicated by any smart engineer with access to GPT-4 and a calendar API? -- I get silence. Neither founder has lived inside the scheduling coordination problem. Neither spent years as a recruiter, an executive assistant, or a scheduling operations lead at a company where calendar chaos was existential. They observed a problem from the outside and applied general intelligence to it. That's engineering, not specific knowledge. "If they can train you to do it, eventually they will train a computer to do it" -- and the scheduling knowledge needed to build this product is exactly the kind that can be taught to any sharp engineer in a few months of customer interviews.

The leverage architecture here is real but thin. Yes, code serving thousands of scheduling negotiations simultaneously is leverage by definition -- one system replacing many human coordinators. But the unit value of each interaction is small. You book a meeting. Compare that to Replit, where one person's code creates an application that serves millions, or Notion, where one workspace replaces five SaaS subscriptions. The leverage multiplication factor in scheduling is bounded by the economic value of what's being coordinated, not the coordination itself. And critically, Vela sits at the application layer, not the infrastructure layer. They're consuming LLM APIs, calendar APIs, and communication platform APIs -- all of which they don't control. My portfolio tells a story I don't always articulate publicly: I systematically back the picks-and-shovels, not the miners. Alchemy over DeFi apps, CoinList over individual tokens, Stack Overflow over individual developer tools. Vela is mining, and the picks-and-shovels providers -- Google, Microsoft, OpenAI -- can absorb this capability into their existing surface area.

The timing here is the opposite of contrarian. "AI scheduling assistant" is the second thing anyone thinks of when they imagine what LLMs can do, right after "chatbot." The competitive landscape confirms this: Calendly at $3B, Clockwise at $76M raised, Motion at $102M raised, Reclaim.ai acquired by Dropbox, Kronologic acquired. This is a category with money already in it, incumbents already watching, and platform owners already positioned. When I invested in Uber, ride-sharing was illegal in most cities -- smart people thought it couldn't work. When I invested in Bitcoin, the consensus was it was digital tulips. Here, the consensus is that AI will handle scheduling -- the only question is who. And "who" is likely to be the company that already owns your calendar and email. The acquisitions of Reclaim.ai and Kronologic aren't signals of market gaps being created; they're signals of incumbents absorbing exactly this capability.

The strongest bull case: Saatvik's experience at AWS ML Supercompute and Perplexity gives genuine depth in building reliable, low-latency AI agent systems. The multi-channel integration work across email, SMS, WhatsApp, and phone is non-trivial engineering that creates some implementation barrier. If the team executes with precision and locks in enterprise recruiting firms before incumbents respond, there's a path to owning conversational scheduling the way Calendly owns link-based scheduling. The brother dynamic -- co-founders since age 14, seven years of building together -- is the kind of long-term alignment I prize. Saatvik dropping out of Booth to build Vela signals real commitment, not resume optimization. If these founders have developed a genuine insight about scheduling coordination that isn't captured in the dossier -- some non-obvious understanding of how recruiters actually make prioritization decisions, or how multi-party scheduling breaks down in ways that aren't addressable by smarter prompting alone -- then this could work. But that insight isn't visible in what I can evaluate.

The technology doesn't compound in any distinctive way. The dossier itself acknowledges "the core capability -- an LLM-based agent that negotiates scheduling via natural language -- is technically replicable by any team with access to frontier language models and calendar/communication APIs." User scheduling preference data could theoretically create a personalization moat over time, but this is speculative and would require massive scale before it becomes defensible. There are no patents, no network effects, no protocol-level dynamics. This is an execution race in a consensus category where the finish line keeps moving as the underlying LLMs improve and the platform owners wake up.

I respect the founders' raw capability and their demonstrated ability to build together over years. But my framework requires the intersection of specific knowledge, leverage, and contrarian timing -- and this company hits none of the three at the level I need for conviction. Smart generalists in a hot market with replicable technology is exactly the pattern I've trained myself to pass on, no matter how impressive the generalists are.
