# Maywood -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Datasite spent $200 million acquiring Grata in June 2025 and absorbed Blueflame AI a month later, with CapVest committing $500 million to fuel further expansion. That's the single most important fact in this dossier, and it's the one that would keep me up at night if I'd written a check here. When the incumbent with $158 million in revenue and a 1,400-person team starts acquiring AI startups in your exact space, you're not watching market validation -- you're watching the ecosystem that's going to swallow you. Maywood is building AI-generated CIMs and deal materials for investment banks. Datasite already has the bank relationships, the data room contracts, the procurement approvals. Adding AI-powered content generation to an existing data room product is a feature integration, not a new company. The structural logic here points toward Maywood becoming an acqui-hire target, not a compounding business.

My framework starts with a simple question: is this a sane person with an insane idea? The Maywood team is impressively sane -- Drake Goodman graduated Summa Cum Laude from Wharton's Huntsman Program and worked PE at Blackstone, which gives him firsthand experience with the deal execution pain he's solving. Kent Goodman and Esteban Vizcaino bring serious MIT EECS credentials, including an ICML 2024 publication on neural methods for PDEs. The sibling co-founder dynamic between Drake and Kent is actually a positive -- deep relational bonds before founding, exactly the kind of pre-existing trust I look for. But the idea? "AI for M&A deal execution" is perhaps the most consensus application of AI in financial services right now. OffDeal raised $17 million for the adjacent space. F2 AI raised $10 million. Blueflame got acquired. ChatFin exists. Every banker I know is talking about automating CIM production. This is a sane person with a sane idea, which is my least favorite combination -- the returns are already priced into the category because every smart person sees this opportunity simultaneously.

The structural moat problem here is severe, and it's the exact category of problem I've spent two years writing about. If AI didn't exist, Maywood doesn't exist. The entire value proposition IS the language model generating financial documents. My "cherry on top" test asks whether a business would be good without AI -- Craftwork still has painting crews and scheduling if you remove the software layer. Maywood has nothing. The software is the business, and I've been saying since September 2024 that software companies that had moats are learning they aren't moats anymore. The enterprise integration argument -- once you're connected to a bank's files, emails, and formatting conventions, switching costs protect you -- has some validity, but it's available to any competitor who gets embedded first, and Datasite starts with existing relationships at most target banks. The SOC 2 Type II certification is a real barrier to entry against garage startups but meaningless against a $500 million war chest.

The strongest bull case would require believing that Maywood's firm-specific customization creates compounding defensibility -- that each bank's historical deal data, formatting conventions, and language patterns make the system irreplaceably good in a way that generic AI tools can't match. If that's true, you'd get genuine lock-in, and each new deal would make the switching costs higher. The $48.8 billion M&A advisory market is enormous, and if Maywood could establish itself as the execution layer across dozens of mid-market banks before Datasite integrates its acquisitions, there's a real wedge. The team's credentials are exactly right for enterprise sales into this market -- a Blackstone pedigree opens doors that cold emails don't. And the two customer testimonials suggesting doubled deal capacity with same headcount indicate real product-market resonance. But for this bull case to work, Maywood needs to win a footrace against a competitor with fifty times its resources and existing distribution into every bank in the world. I don't bet on footraces.

There's no new primitive being created here, no protocol that other businesses build on, no compounding network effect. Maywood is an application-layer tool automating an existing workflow on top of someone else's infrastructure. Compare this to Venmo, which established a new payment primitive, or Aleo, which created zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure -- those investments created layers that generated ecosystem effects. Maywood generates CIMs faster. That's valuable, genuinely, but it's a productivity tool, not a platform. The narrative can expand from M&A to broader investment banking workflows, maybe to all financial document generation, but that expansion path leads directly into Bloomberg and S&P territory, which caps rather than expands the story.

The team is strong enough that if they were attacking a structurally non-consensus problem -- something most VCs dismissed as impossible or uneconomic -- I'd lean in hard. But they're attacking the most obvious application of LLMs to an industry that every AI startup and incumbent is already targeting. I'd rather fund the operational complexity that software amplifies but can't replace. This is a tech company with a finance layer, not a finance company with a tech layer.
