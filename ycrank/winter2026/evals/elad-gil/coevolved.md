# Coevolved -- Elad Gil Evaluation

The first thing I notice is the pivot. Coevolved archived a general-purpose multi-agent orchestration framework in January 2026 and emerged from YC a month later as a mortgage origination company. Pivots at pre-seed are normal -- the issue isn't the pivot itself but what it reveals about domain depth. Neither founder has documented experience in mortgage lending, financial services, or regulatory compliance. Mortgage origination is one of the most heavily regulated workflows in consumer finance: TRID disclosure timelines, ECOA fair lending requirements, state-by-state licensing, CFPB oversight of automated decisioning. I've invested in regulated markets repeatedly -- Coinbase, Color Health, Anduril -- because compliance barriers create structural moats that deter other software investors. But the moat only works if you can navigate the regulation. Brian Armstrong had been obsessing about crypto infrastructure before Coinbase. When I co-founded Color, I brought a biology PhD and years of genomics research. Here, two talented CS graduates decided to enter mortgage origination recently, and I don't see evidence of the domain credibility needed to sell to risk-averse loan officers or survive regulatory scrutiny on AI-driven underwriting decisions.

The structural moment in mortgage automation is real but not non-obvious. LLM document understanding crossed a reliability threshold in 2024-2025, mortgage origination costs remain above $10,000 per loan (MBA data), and National Mortgage News explicitly flagged 2026 as "pivotal for mortgage AI adoption." This is exactly the kind of inflection I look for -- technology capability meeting market pain. But the problem is that everyone else sees it too. Blend has raised $685M+ and already serves the digital lending market. Tavant powers one in three U.S. mortgage loans. Ocrolus raised $80M specifically for document processing in lending. Candor has patented automated underwriting. When I mapped the AI market in my "AI Market Clarity" framework, I distinguished between markets where the structural opportunity is non-obvious and markets where the TAM slide writes itself. Mortgage AI automation is the latter. The $2.3 billion mortgage origination software TAM is well-understood by every fintech investor in the ecosystem. This isn't PagerDuty in 2010, where operations alerting seemed boring and niche. This is a consensus market with well-funded incumbents who have existing lender relationships, LOS integrations, and the capital to build or acquire AI capabilities.

The strongest bull case: mortgage is genuinely "boring but critical" enterprise infrastructure, the pre-LLM incumbents face real architectural debt (Blend's workflow digitization is fundamentally different from agentic automation), and a lightweight, AI-native product could win on speed-to-value with independent mortgage bankers who can't afford Tavant's enterprise deployments. The founders are technically capable -- Athan Zhang's NLP research under Danqi Chen at Princeton, his Five Rings quant internship, and his prior startup experience raising $1.2M for Vytal demonstrate both technical ability and entrepreneurial drive. Alex Li's distributed computing experience at The Trade Desk and voice AI work at Ultravox add engineering depth. If they land a handful of early lender customers, iterate rapidly on compliance requirements, and build proprietary training data from processed mortgage documents, the switching costs once integrated into lender workflows could compound into a defensible position. I've seen young technical founders develop domain expertise quickly when the iteration loop is tight. For this to work, though, they'd need to demonstrate that their integrated agentic architecture produces meaningfully better outcomes than composing Ocrolus for document processing with off-the-shelf LLM APIs for extraction -- and that's the question I can't answer from what's in front of me.

The commoditization concern is where I get stuck. The dossier lays it out plainly: document OCR, data extraction, form auto-fill, and anomaly detection are individually available from horizontal AI platforms. When I apply the "software-driven versus software-aware" test, I'm not yet convinced that the integrated mortgage-specific orchestration creates a compounding advantage rather than a convenience layer. A well-funded fintech company -- or Blend itself adding an AI module -- could assemble similar capabilities. The single-miracle framework is helpful here: what's the one thing that must work? It's not the AI (foundation model labs are delivering that). It's not the workflow (document intake flows are well-understood). It's achieving enough mortgage domain specificity and lender trust to create switching costs before an incumbent or another startup does the same thing. But that miracle depends on sales velocity into a market where they have no relationships and no domain credibility, while simultaneously navigating fair lending compliance. That's at least two miracles compounding.

The product-to-distribution trajectory has structural potential -- start with document intake and verification, expand into full underwriting automation, then servicing, then become the lending infrastructure platform. That's a real path. But I see no evidence the founders have articulated this expansion vision, and conference attendance at MBA IMB26 as the only distribution signal is thin. The best companies I've backed were aggressive about distribution from their earliest days. What I'd want to hear is a concrete plan: which segment of lenders they're targeting first, why those lenders can't get this from Blend or Tavant, and what the integration hook looks like that creates lock-in. Without that, this is a product, not a distribution channel.

I'm passing. The market is real, the timing is defensible, and the founders are technically strong. But this doesn't match my pattern for regulated-market investments -- I need to see either deep domain expertise or a structural vacancy where no credible competitor exists. Neither condition holds here. The mortgage automation market is contested by players with hundreds of millions in funding, and the founders are entering it cold. A recent pivot from a general agent framework into a compliance-heavy vertical without domain experience, facing well-entrenched incumbents who could build similar AI capabilities, requiring both regulatory navigation and enterprise sales credibility they haven't yet demonstrated -- that's more miracles than I'm comfortable with.
