# Didit -- Vinod Khosla Evaluation

Here is a company that has pivoted from building a blockchain identity protocol in the metaverse to offering cheaper KYC checks than Sumsub. Let me say that again: they went from attempting something structurally different about digital identity -- however misguided the Web3 framing -- to competing on price in a commodity market. That pivot tells me everything about the ambition calibration. The founders looked at the identity verification landscape and asked, "How do we make this 70% cheaper?" instead of asking, "How do we make this obsolete?" They've reduced their risk of failure by choosing a well-understood business model in a proven market with established customer demand. And in doing so, they've ensured that the consequence of their success is a modestly profitable B2B SaaS company in a crowded field. That is exactly the tradeoff I refuse to make.

The traction numbers are real and I won't pretend otherwise. Seven hundred active B2B customers growing 20% month-over-month, 300%+ net revenue retention at month six, close to profitability on only $2M raised -- that's exceptional capital efficiency. If I were a different kind of investor, the spreadsheet would be compelling. But spreadsheets are fiction. The question isn't whether Didit can build a business. It clearly can. The question is whether the business it's building matters at a scale that justifies backing it over a thousand other competent teams. If Didit captures 5% of a $30 billion market, that's a $1.5 billion company. Respectable. But nobody's life is fundamentally different. No trillion-dollar system becomes obsolete. The meat industry doesn't transform. The energy grid doesn't reinvent itself. Businesses just pay slightly less for identity checks they were already buying from someone else.

The dossier itself identifies the core problem: "The primary differentiation is pricing and integration speed rather than proprietary technology." The underlying stack -- OCR, biometric matching, liveness detection -- is commoditizing rapidly. Open-source models are improving. Cloud AI services are getting cheaper. Every tailwind that enables Didit's free tier simultaneously enables the next competitor to offer the same thing. Persona has $418 million in funding. Veriff is growing 75% year-over-year. Sumsub does $86 million in revenue. Didit is bringing a knife to a gunfight -- a sharp knife, wielded efficiently, but a knife nonetheless. When I backed Juniper against Cisco, it wasn't because Juniper routers were 70% cheaper. It was because TCP/IP was going to make Cisco's entire architecture structurally irrelevant. There is no equivalent structural obsolescence in Didit's thesis. Incumbents can match pricing whenever they choose to -- it's a business model decision for them, not a physics constraint.

The strongest bull case would require the "reusable KYC" feature -- verify once, use everywhere -- to become the actual product thesis rather than a bullet point among twelve other features. If Didit built a universal identity layer where a single verification unlocks every regulated service globally, that's a network-effects business that could genuinely transform how identity works. It would make per-verification pricing obsolete entirely, the way email made per-message postal fees irrelevant. That vision would be worth funding at 90% failure odds. But it's not what they're building. They're building a verification API with competitive pricing. The reusable credential is a feature, not the foundation. The founders' mathematics backgrounds and Alberto's StyleGAN2 work suggest genuine ML capability, and their willingness to abandon the Gamium thesis demonstrates learning rate. Twin founders who've coded together since age twelve and competed as professional athletes have a relational resilience most co-founders lack. These are smart, adaptable people who could be attacking a much larger problem. The timing is favorable -- deepfakes make identity verification urgent, inference costs enable new pricing models, and regulatory expansion widens the market. But all of those tailwinds are consensus. Every identity verification startup in this cohort year is riding the same wave.

I pass. Not because the founders aren't capable -- they clearly are. Not because the market isn't real -- it's growing at 15% annually. I pass because the consequence of maximum success is insufficient. These founders have chosen to compete on price in a market where the incumbents have hundreds of millions in funding and the technology is commoditizing. They've optimized for a high probability of building a reasonable business at the cost of any possibility of building a transformational one. I'd rather back someone attempting something the industry considers impossible and failing than someone executing competently on a vision that, even at its most successful, changes nothing fundamental about how the world works.
