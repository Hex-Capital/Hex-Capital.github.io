# Mantis Biotechnology -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The thing that immediately catches my eye is the Louiza Labs trajectory. Georgia Witchel co-founded Louiza Labs as CTO in YC S25, raised over $5 million building a physics engine for simulated human biology, and then six months later founded Mantis Biotechnology as CEO in YC W26 -- in essentially the same problem domain. Both companies are listed as active. This is either very good or very bad. The good interpretation: she built the simulation layer, discovered that the real bottleneck was the data layer underneath it, and pivoted to build the actual infrastructure. That's how organic problem discovery works -- you build the wrong thing first and the right thing reveals itself. Emmett Shear sold Kiko on eBay for $258K before I funded him again for Justin.tv. Founders who iterate toward the real problem are stronger than founders who guess correctly on day one. The bad interpretation: there's an unresolved corporate situation with a company that raised $5M from other people's money, and the IP boundaries between two closely related YC companies are unclear. I can't resolve this from the outside, but I'd need to before writing a check.

The organic origin story here is legitimately strong if you trace it. Witchel didn't sit down and brainstorm "what's a good biotech startup idea." She was an elite ice climber who broke eight world records, which means she spent years generating and being surrounded by human performance data -- biometrics, motion capture, training logs. Then she studied CS at Harvey Mudd and bioengineering at UW. Then she built simulation software at Louiza Labs and presumably hit the wall that everyone in this space hits: the data sources are fragmented, incompatible, and nobody has built the unification layer. The progression from athlete to bioengineering student to simulation builder to data infrastructure founder has the shape of genuine discovery. Each step revealed the next problem.

The schlep here is enormous, and that's what makes this interesting. Biomedical data integration across motion capture, biometric sensors, medical imaging, training logs, and clinical systems is exactly the kind of ugly, multi-stakeholder, regulatory-heavy problem that causes schlep blindness. The evidence for this is right in the competitive landscape: Unlearn.AI raised $135M but only does clinical trial synthetic controls. Quibim raised $70M but only does imaging-specific organ models. Twin Health raised $301M but only does consumer metabolic health. Dassault has been at it for eight years with essentially unlimited resources but only does organ-specific simulation for device testing. Every well-funded player in this space chose a specific vertical rather than building the horizontal data layer. When you see that pattern -- obvious problem, well-funded companies all around it, nobody building the plumbing -- that's schlep blindness operating at scale. The plumbing is too ugly, too regulatory, too cross-disciplinary. Everyone unconsciously looks away and picks the cleaner vertical bet instead.

The bull case for this being a great investment requires believing three things: first, that the Louiza Labs experience gave Witchel genuine technical insight into what the data infrastructure layer needs to look like -- not theoretical knowledge but the kind that comes from having built the simulation layer and hit the data wall firsthand. Second, that her combination of CS, bioengineering, and athletic domain knowledge is rare enough to constitute a real moat -- most software engineers lack the biological intuition, and most biologists lack the engineering craft. Third, that biomedical data integration is a plumbing problem that will eventually support an enormous ecosystem, the way AWS emerged from Amazon's internal infrastructure needs. If all three are true, you get a company that's building the Stripe of biomedical data: obvious problem, massive schlep, low competition because nobody wants to do the work. That's a genuinely compelling case.

But I have real structural concerns. She's listed as a solo founder on YC. I've written extensively about why this worries me -- cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. The team page lists three people, but Sarah Jiang appears to be a PhD student, and the third member is unidentified. Building biomedical data infrastructure across regulatory, clinical, and technical domains with a team this thin is daunting. The website is essentially empty -- just a header. There's zero public evidence of users, revenue, or even a working prototype. For a company claiming to unify heterogeneous biomedical data types and validate outputs against real-world outcomes, the absence of any demonstrated capability is a gap. The "forward-deployed engineers" mention on the YC page hints at customer engagement, but without specifics, it's a hint, not evidence.

Witchel is clearly technical -- Harvey Mudd CS, 43 GitHub repos, built a physics engine at Louiza Labs -- and her cross-disciplinary background is genuinely unusual. The combination of competitive athletics, computer science, and biomedical engineering in one person doesn't come from a brainstorming session. She's the kind of person who might actually have the right mental models for this problem. But having the right background and actually building the product that captures the market are different things, and at this stage the product is more vision than artifact.

This lands in the territory of a company I'd want to watch closely but can't yet write a check for. The problem discovery is organic, the schlep is real, and the founder has relevant technical depth. What's missing is any evidence that the product works, that customers want it, and clarity on the Louiza Labs corporate situation. If she can show me a working prototype that a pharma company is actually using to integrate their data -- even a single customer running real queries against a unified dataset -- the calculus shifts significantly. Right now, the vision is right but the evidence is thin.
