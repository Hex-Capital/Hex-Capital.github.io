# Cascade -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Cascade is building AI safety infrastructure for autonomous agents -- and that sentence alone tells you almost everything you need to know about why this doesn't work for me. My entire framework is built around the question "would this business be good if AI didn't exist?" and Cascade's answer is definitionally no. The business exists because AI agents exist. It monitors AI agents. It secures AI agents. If you remove the AI component, there is no business, no product, no market, nothing. This is the purest possible example of an AI-first company where AI IS the core value proposition, which sits squarely in my "avoid" column. The structural logic doesn't matter how smart the founders are -- and they are clearly smart people.

Let me be precise about the founder-idea calibration because it's where Cascade most clearly falls into the wrong quadrant of my framework. AlSayyad researched with Dawn Song at BAIR, did pen-testing on AI systems, consulted for NASA. Demirhan built production monitoring infrastructure at Netflix and Amazon. These are credentialed, technically capable people. The "sane" half of my equation checks out at a moderate level -- they're recent Berkeley graduates without prior exits or startup-scale leadership, so it's not the same as a Yakovenko coming out of Qualcomm's systems engineering division, but it's real. The problem is entirely on the "insane" side: there is absolutely nothing non-consensus about building AI safety infrastructure in 2026. Gartner is publishing forecasts about "guardian agents." WitnessAI has raised $58 million. Fiddler AI has raised roughly $100 million. F5 acquired CalypsoAI for $180 million. Meta open-sourced LlamaFirewall. This is a sane idea being pursued by sane people, and that combination is precisely what produces mediocre venture returns -- you're buying into a thesis the market has already priced.

The structural moat question is where this really falls apart through my lens. Cascade's differentiation is "self-improving safety models" -- meaning their moat is that their AI is better at catching AI failures than competitors' AI. But that moat is itself made of software, and my whole thesis is that software moats are dissolving. If your competitive advantage is a model, and the barrier to building models drops every six months, and your competitors include open-source projects (Guardrails AI, Invariant Labs, LlamaFirewall) and well-funded startups and the AI platform providers themselves -- where exactly does lock-in come from? The dossier speculates about a "compounding data advantage as the self-improving models encounter more threat patterns," and I grant that data flywheels are real, but you need meaningful deployment to start the flywheel, and Cascade has zero public traction while competitors have multi-year head starts and tens of millions in funding. Compare this to something like Craftwork, where the moat is actual human painters showing up to paint your house -- no amount of AI progress replicates physical labor. Cascade has no physical-world component, no regulatory moat, no protocol-layer lock-in.

Here's the bull case I want to genuinely engage with: there may be a structural conflict of interest where AI providers cannot credibly audit their own agents' safety, creating a permanent role for independent third-party monitors -- analogous to how financial auditing firms exist separately from the companies they audit. If regulators mandate independent AI safety audits, a company with the deepest experience in autonomous agent failure patterns becomes essential infrastructure. In this world, Cascade's "guardian agent layer" becomes a new primitive -- a trust layer that sits between agent platforms and enterprise deployments. The founders' BAIR pedigree and Dawn Song connection position them credibly for this regulatory-driven future. And the CalypsoAI acquisition at $180 million suggests that even a modest outcome in this space returns a pre-seed check handsomely. I take this seriously. But this bull case requires betting on a specific regulatory outcome that hasn't materialized, and it requires Cascade to win a race against better-funded competitors who would benefit equally from that same regulatory tailwind. The regulatory moat is speculative; the competitive disadvantage in funding and traction is real today.

The narrative ceiling is theoretically expansive -- "making autonomous intelligence safe" could grow to encompass every deployed AI agent across every enterprise -- but when fifty companies are telling variations of the same story, narrative magnitude gets diluted. An infinity story only creates venture-scale returns when you're telling it before anyone else sees the opportunity. In AI safety, everybody sees it. The TAM numbers are impressive ($49 billion growing to $160 billion by Gartner's estimate), but large consensus TAMs are precisely the markets where incumbents with distribution eat startups for breakfast. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and the AI platform providers will not cede the safety layer to a two-person pre-seed startup when they have the distribution, the data, and the economic incentive to own it themselves.

I respect the founders' technical depth and the genuineness of the problem they're addressing. Autonomous agents will need safety infrastructure. But the investable question isn't whether the problem is real -- it's whether a pre-seed startup with no traction can build a defensible position in a consensus market against competitors with hundred-million-dollar head starts, platform providers with distribution advantages, and open-source alternatives that keep lowering the floor. Every signal points to this being a feature that gets absorbed rather than a primitive that compounds. Pass.
