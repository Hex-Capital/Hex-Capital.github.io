# Bidflow -- Elad Gil Evaluation

Electrical estimating is exactly the kind of market that triggers the wrong reaction in most investors -- "boring," "niche," "too physical." When I hear those words, I lean in. PagerDuty faced the same dismissal. Gusto faced it with payroll. The pattern is consistent: deeply embedded workflow infrastructure that every company in a category needs, where the market appears small because nobody's built the product that unlocks the full addressable base. And the structural moment here is real. The data center construction boom, driven by AI infrastructure buildout, is creating a capacity crisis for electrical contractors. U.S. data center power spending is projected to grow from $15 billion to $21 billion by 2030, and every one of those projects needs detailed electrical estimates. Combine that with an estimator labor shortage -- NECA flagged shifting workforce trends in 2024 -- and you have a genuine supply-demand gap that AI tools can address. This isn't a static TAM play. The underlying electrical contractor services market is $237 billion, and the software penetration rate is tiny. The "why now" is the collision of rising demand, shrinking labor supply, and computer vision models crossing the accuracy threshold for blueprint symbol recognition in the 2023-2025 window.

But here's where my enthusiasm hits resistance: this market is not non-obvious. Beam AI has raised $48 million and serves 1,100+ companies. Togal.AI has $17.5 million. Procore acquired Esticom in 2020. When I see well-funded AI-native competitors already operating in construction takeoffs, that tells me the structural moment has been identified by the market. Bidflow's bet is that electrical specialization -- deeper integration with NECA labor unit standards, electrical-specific symbol libraries, material assembly logic -- creates a wedge that multi-trade platforms won't match. This is a reasonable thesis. It mirrors how Gusto beat broader HR platforms by going deep on SMB payroll before expanding. But Gusto didn't face a competitor with $48 million and 1,100 customers when it was a two-person team. The question is whether Beam AI, which announced expansion into estimating and bidding features in November 2025, decides to invest in electrical depth -- because at their resource level, hiring two electrical estimating domain experts and building NECA integration is a quarter-long project, not a structural barrier.

The founders are technically impressive and clearly fast builders. USACO Platinum, Jane Street externship, bootstrapping a company to $120K revenue by age 16 -- these are real execution signals. They shipped a working product with 83.5% accuracy on electrical takeoffs, landed three named customers, and have a testimonial from Bass Electric's owner citing a 5x reduction in estimate time. For a team that pivoted into this domain recently, that's meaningful velocity. But the pivot itself is the concern I can't dismiss. The contact email still references tryghostship.dev. LinkedIn profiles say "YC S25." These are two competitive programmers who were building QA agents for bug detection months ago and are now selling to electrical contractors in the Tri-State Area. I've seen builders this strong succeed in domains they entered cold -- the skill transfer from competitive programming to building AI systems is real. But construction is a relationship-driven, trust-heavy industry where sales cycles are long and contractors want to see you at the NECA trade show, not just on a Calendly link. The distribution challenge in this market requires a different muscle than the product challenge.

The bull case for Bidflow would require a few things to be true. First, that electrical specialization creates genuine defensibility -- that a multi-trade platform can't replicate the NECA labor unit depth and electrical-specific workflow without sacrificing focus on its broader business. This is plausible but not proven. Second, that the 83.5% accuracy improves to 95%+ through the data flywheel of user corrections, creating a compounding advantage. At 83.5%, one in six counts needs manual correction -- that's useful for speeding up the process (the 5x claim from Bass Electric suggests it is), but it's not reliable enough to fundamentally change the estimator's workflow. Third, that the founders develop distribution muscle in a conservative industry quickly enough to build a customer base before Beam AI or Togal add electrical depth. If all three are true, Bidflow could become the system of record for electrical estimating and expand into bidding, procurement, and project management -- the Gusto path from payroll to full HR platform. That's a real product-to-distribution trajectory.

My concern is that this plan requires at least two miracles: achieving best-in-class AI accuracy on electrical takeoffs (a technical challenge competing against teams with 20x+ their resources) AND building distribution into a traditional industry where the founders have no domain background or relationships. Those are different problems requiring different skills, and compounding two moderate-probability outcomes produces a low-probability path. The Harvey comparison is instructive -- Harvey's single miracle (model fidelity for legal work) was being delivered by foundation model labs externally, freeing the team to focus entirely on workflow, enterprise trust, and distribution. Bidflow's AI accuracy miracle has to be delivered internally, by a two-person team, while simultaneously solving distribution in an unfamiliar industry. That's a harder configuration.

The product-to-distribution trajectory has potential but is currently unrealized. A unified platform integrating takeoffs, labor units, material pricing, and BOMs is the right architectural choice -- it creates switching costs and positions for expansion. But at two people with no public revenue data and three named customers, the distribution trajectory is theoretical. I'd want to see evidence that the founders are thinking about how electrical estimating becomes the wedge into a broader contractor workflow platform, and I'd want to see a concrete path into the next hundred customers that doesn't rely solely on direct sales from a two-person team. The geographic focus on the Northeast is pragmatic but constraining.

This is a Neutral evaluation. The market has genuine structural tailwinds -- the data center boom, labor shortage, and legacy software displacement create a real opportunity. The team ships fast. But the competitive landscape is more crowded than I'd like to see for a pre-seed bet, the founders entered this domain very recently with no construction background, and the plan requires overcoming multiple independent obstacles simultaneously. I'd want to see accuracy climb above 90%, customer count grow to 15-20 with retention data, and some evidence of a repeatable distribution motion before investing.
