# Samora AI -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Voice AI agents might be the single most crowded AI category on the planet right now. Funding into the space jumped 8x from 2023 to 2024. PolyAI has $200M+ and a $750M valuation. Bland AI just raised $40M. Vapi, Synthflow, Retell -- all funded, all building the same thing. When I see five well-capitalized competitors racing toward an obviously large TAM, I know one thing for certain: the opportunity is priced. Whatever alpha existed in "voice agents will replace call centers" was arbitraged away two years ago. So the question for Samora isn't whether the market is real -- it obviously is -- but whether there's anything structurally non-consensus about this particular entry point that justifies backing a pre-seed team against opponents with 50x their capital.

Kartik Sawhney is genuinely impressive. Stanford CS dual-degree, built on Microsoft's Cortana team, ran a $25M AI for Accessibility program, co-founded I-Stem across 80+ countries, Forbes 30 Under 30, UN Young Leader. The "sane" in my sane-person-insane-idea filter is fully satisfied. The three co-founders have worked together for years at I-Stem, which is the kind of relational depth I look for in founding teams -- this isn't a speed-dating match. But here's where my framework gets uncomfortable: the idea isn't insane. Building voice AI agents for enterprise customers is the most consensus AI play in the YC Winter 2026 batch and probably in the entire venture ecosystem. The multilingual and emerging-market angle adds a degree of geographic non-consensus -- most VCs would raise an eyebrow at targeting Government of India and UNICEF as anchor clients rather than US enterprises -- but "voice agents for India" isn't a genuinely contrarian thesis. It's a niche within a consensus thesis. That's a sane person with a sane idea, which in my framework means the returns are already being competed away.

The AI-resistance question is where this really falls apart for me. My most basic test: would this business exist without AI? No. The entire product is AI. Remove the LLM, the TTS, the STT models -- there's nothing left. This is the opposite of my "cherry on top" framework. The underlying models from OpenAI, Google, and Meta are improving rapidly and democratically -- every improvement benefits every competitor equally. OpenAI's Whisper already handles 90+ languages. Meta's MMS does a thousand. The multilingual data flywheel from 1M+ calls is a real but fragile advantage because it's a race against model commoditization, and Samora is running that race with a fraction of the capital. The managed service model provides a sliver of operational complexity that pure-API competitors don't have, but "we run the calls for you" is services revenue, not infrastructure lock-in. It's closer to running a call center with better software than building a new primitive.

That said, here's the bull case I take seriously: institutional relationships are genuinely hard to build, and Samora has them. Getting Government of India and UNICEF as clients isn't something you can replicate with a bigger engineering team or a better model. Those relationships were forged through years of I-Stem's accessibility work, and they represent embedded trust in contexts where procurement cycles are measured in years, not sprint cycles. If the thesis is that the next trillion phone interactions happen in Hindi, Arabic, Swahili, and dozens of regional dialects, and that Western-focused voice AI companies structurally deprioritize these markets because the per-minute economics don't pencil against Silicon Valley burn rates, then Samora could build a defensible regional position. The 1M+ calls processed and named enterprise clients are real traction -- better than most pre-seed companies. If I believed the multilingual data moat compounds faster than the underlying models commoditize it, this would be a different evaluation. But I don't believe that. The trajectory of foundation model improvement in multilingual speech is moving faster than any startup's proprietary data collection can stay ahead of.

The protocol-layer test is straightforward: Samora is building an application on top of other people's infrastructure, full stop. They're not creating a new primitive that others build on. They're not establishing a standard or a protocol. They're a managed service consuming LLM APIs and speech models. That's the architectural position that gets squeezed from above (model providers adding voice capabilities directly) and below (developers building their own agents on Vapi or Retell's infrastructure). I'd rather fund the picks-and-shovels layer than the gold miners, and Samora is mining gold in a less popular part of the mountain. The narrative can theoretically expand to "voice operations infrastructure for every organization on Earth," but that same narrative belongs to five better-funded competitors, and the emerging-market focus actually caps rather than expands the story because lower-ARPU markets constrain the economics that power the narrative engine.
