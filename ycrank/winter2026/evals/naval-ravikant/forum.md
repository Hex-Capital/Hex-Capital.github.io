# Forum -- Naval Ravikant Evaluation

The most striking thing about Forum isn't what the founders are building -- it's the timing signal the market is sending them. Four funded competitors launched attention trading products in a sixty-day window: Noise raised $7.1M from Paradigm, Zora shipped on Solana, Polymarket announced attention markets via Kaito for March 2026. When four teams converge on the same idea simultaneously, you're not contrarian -- you're consensus. And when you're consensus but slower than your competitors because you've chosen the regulated path, your timing isn't just not-contrarian, it's structurally disadvantaged. The question becomes: does the regulated moat compensate for arriving last?

Owen Botkin's background in long/short equities at Balyasny is relevant -- he understands market microstructure, order book dynamics, and regulatory process. That's real knowledge. But it's transferable knowledge. Hundreds of former hedge fund associates understand these mechanics. The specific knowledge I look for -- the kind that emerges from years of obsessive inquiry and can't be replicated by a smart person with six months of study -- would be deep, original insight into how attention functions as an economic quantity, how cultural relevance can be reliably quantified, or why existing measurements systematically misprice attention. The dossier shows no evidence that either founder has that kind of non-teachable understanding of the attention domain itself. Thomas's engineering across NASA, GEICO, and DreamwaveAI demonstrates breadth, not depth in any domain adjacent to attention economics or exchange infrastructure. They're building an exchange for a new asset class, but the finance half knows exchanges and the engineering half knows engineering -- who on this team has the deep, idiosyncratic knowledge about the asset itself?

The leverage architecture of an exchange is well-understood and genuinely powerful -- code mediating millions of trades with near-zero marginal cost, liquidity attracting liquidity in a virtuous cycle. I've seen this work at CoinList, where we built the infrastructure for token distribution and the network effects compounded relentlessly. But CoinList worked because the underlying assets -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Filecoin -- were already generating organic demand. Forum's challenge is more fundamental: the asset class they're creating doesn't exist yet. The underlying data is publicly available Google Trends and social media APIs. The indices are constructed, not discovered. An exchange is a leveraged business, but only after you solve the bootstrapping problem -- and bootstrapping liquidity for a novel asset class with simulated currency, as a two-person team competing against platforms with billions in volume, is not a leverage problem. It's an existence problem.

The bull case deserves serious engagement. If attention trading becomes a legitimate asset class -- and the $650 billion digital advertising market suggests that attention already has enormous economic value, just no direct financial instrument -- then the regulated U.S. exchange wins in the long run. Kalshi proved a startup can obtain DCM status and build a real business ($260M in 2025 revenue). Crypto platforms can never serve institutional capital or U.S. retail at scale without regulatory transformation. If Forum obtains CFTC designation, they'd own the regulated infrastructure for a new category of derivatives. The analogy would be: CME didn't invent weather, but weather derivatives created a new market. Forum doesn't need to invent attention -- they need to convince regulators that attention derivatives serve a legitimate hedging function for advertisers, media companies, and talent managers. Botkin's finance pedigree and the choice to pursue regulation over crypto shortcuts signal the kind of long-term orientation I respect. Both founders dropped out of university for this -- that's conviction, not positioning.

But conviction without specific knowledge is just determination. And the structural problem remains: the regulated path takes years, the crypto competitors are live today, and the underlying data sources are commoditized. Noise already has 1,300 beta users with 62% retention. Polymarket has $21.5 billion in 2025 volume and is adding attention markets next month. By the time Forum obtains regulatory approval -- if they obtain it -- the market will have either validated or invalidated "attention trading" as a concept, and they'll have had no participation in determining which. The anti-manipulation methodology for social-media-derived indices is an unsolved hard problem that the dossier doesn't address. And "Forum" as a brand name in a consumer trading product creates unnecessary friction -- it's fighting SEO battles before it fights market battles. I'd want to see evidence that these founders possess insight into attention quantification that their competitors don't -- a proprietary methodology, a non-obvious theory of cultural dynamics, something that couldn't be replicated by any competent team with API access to the same data feeds. Without that, this is a regulatory arbitrage play in a consensus category, and regulatory arbitrage without domain-specific knowledge is a bet on process, not on understanding.
