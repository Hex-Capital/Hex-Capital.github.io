# Condor Energy -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first about Condor Energy: this is a company that doesn't need me. And I mean that specifically -- the kind of investor this company needs is someone who runs a spreadsheet on the energy management software TAM, checks the credential boxes on the founders' LinkedIn profiles, and writes a check based on market sizing and competitive positioning. That investor exists, and they're probably right for this deal. But that's not how I invest, and when I look at Condor through my lens, the signals I depend on are mostly absent.

When I sit down with founders, I always start the same way -- tell me your story, not the business. And what the dossier gives me on Jean, Clément, and Florian is professional biography: École Polytechnique, HEC Paris, UCL, Audencia. Power trading desks and hydropower operations. These are competent, well-credentialed people who identified a market gap through 200+ customer interviews and built a product to fill it. That's good product development discipline. But I'm not hearing the thing I listen for -- the biographical thread that makes this founder inseparable from this problem. Nobody here grew up watching their family's workshop shut down because energy costs were opaque and unmanageable. Nobody here was the small business owner who got destroyed by a hedging mistake they didn't understand. The connection to the problem is professional, not personal, and in my experience that distinction matters enormously when the company hits its first real crisis. The founders who built their company from lived pain are the ones who find another gear when everything breaks.

The bull case here is real, and I want to be honest about it. Energy markets are undergoing a genuine structural transformation -- intermittent renewables creating price volatility, the data center buildout creating a new class of enormous electricity buyers, and the 2022-2023 European energy crisis searing procurement risk into CFO consciousness. A power trader who understands hedging instruments, paired with operators who've built energy infrastructure, targeting the buyer side that's genuinely underserved by existing tools -- that's a coherent thesis. If Condor becomes the operating system that every large electricity buyer uses to manage procurement, hedging, and capex decisions, the outcome could be very large. The competitive positioning is thoughtful: Voltus serves the sell side, Pexapark serves renewable developers, Granular Energy serves utilities. Condor serves the buyer. That's a valid gap. But a valid gap filled by a competent team is exactly what consensus-based investing looks like, and consensus-based investing is very different from conviction-based investing.

What I don't feel here is the jolt -- that intuitive energy I got with Niantic, or the sense of discovering something nobody else sees. Energy management SaaS for large enterprises is a category that already has multiple well-funded players circling adjacent spaces, and the large enterprise incumbents (SAP, Schneider Electric) could build this if the opportunity becomes obvious enough. The "up to 20% savings" claim is the kind of value proposition that gets a meeting with a procurement team, but it doesn't reshape how the world works. I invest in companies that make invisible systems visible to people who need that visibility -- Affirm made credit terms transparent for consumers who were being exploited by hidden fees, Flock Safety brought public safety data to communities that had none. Condor makes energy costs more transparent to CFOs at companies spending over a million euros a year on electricity. That's useful. It's not transformative for the people who need transformation most.

The co-founder dynamics are actually one of the brighter spots here -- Jean and Clément share both educational background at X-HEC and operational experience on hydropower projects, which means they've already worked through real-world problems together before starting a company. Florian brings genuinely complementary skills from the trading side. This isn't a random assemblage of co-founders who met at a hackathon. But I haven't seen evidence of how they handle real disagreement under pressure, and with a three-person team trying to sell enterprise software across two continents with fundamentally different electricity market structures, that pressure is coming.

I'm passing on this one. Not because it's a bad company -- it might turn out to be a solid enterprise SaaS business that returns 5x to its investors. But it doesn't match how I invest. The founders are credentialed rather than forged. The idea is sensible rather than weird. The customers are powerful rather than underserved. And the market, while large, is already attracting the kind of attention that arbitrages away the return premium I look for. The best investments I've made were ones where I was uncomfortable, where the idea sounded a little bit crazy, where the founder's personal story made me feel something visceral. Condor doesn't make me uncomfortable. It makes me nod politely and say "that makes sense" -- which, in my experience, is the most dangerous phrase in early-stage investing.
