# Corelayer -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Corelayer is a textbook case of what I call schlep blindness. Every engineer who has ever been paged at 3am to debug a data pipeline knows the pain. Bad data -- missing rows, duplicated values, incorrect transformations -- is a category of production incident that Datadog and PagerDuty fundamentally cannot catch, because those tools watch infrastructure health, not data content. To actually diagnose data problems, you have to inspect the data itself. And in financial services or healthcare, inspecting production data means navigating a maze of compliance requirements, on-prem deployments, and security audits that would make most startup founders break out in hives. This is exactly the kind of problem that hides in plain sight -- obvious to anyone who has lived it, invisible to anyone who hasn't -- because the compliance schlep is so ugly that your unconscious filters it out before you even consider it as a startup idea.

The organic origin here is strong. Both founders built data infrastructure at Goldman Sachs, working on systems that processed hundreds of billions of rows daily. They didn't read a market report about AIOps and decide to start a company. They were the people getting paged. They were the ones manually tracing bad data through complex pipelines at 3am. When Mitch and Shipra describe this problem, they're describing their own lives -- the same way Drew Houston described forgetting his USB drive. The problem found them; they didn't go looking for it. And the Goldman Sachs background isn't just credibility theater -- it gives them intuition about what regulated enterprises actually need (on-prem deployment, confidential compute, audit trails) that a team coming from a cloud-native startup wouldn't naturally build first. The fact that they already have SOC 2 Type I certification as a two-person pre-seed company tells me they understand their customer's buying process at a visceral level.

What gives me pause is the competitive landscape and the complete absence of user evidence. Resolve AI has raised $160M. incident.io has raised $96M. BigPanda has raised $431M. These are not sleeping incumbents. Now, I'd argue that the specific wedge Corelayer is attacking -- data-content debugging inside confidential compute environments for regulated industries -- is one that cloud-native competitors structurally resist. Datadog cannot easily pivot to inspecting customers' actual production data on-prem, because it conflicts with their entire business model and margin structure. That structural protection is real. But the individual components of what Corelayer does -- anomaly detection, LLM-powered log analysis, root-cause suggestion -- are commoditizing fast. The moat has to come from the specificity of the regulated-industry deployment, not from the AI itself.

The bull case is this: if Corelayer can land two or three Fortune 100 financial services companies during or shortly after YC, the domain expertise and compliance infrastructure become a genuine moat. Enterprise customers in regulated industries don't switch vendors lightly. The accumulated debugging context -- system maps, data flow knowledge, historical incident patterns -- would create real switching costs. And the market timing is favorable: LLMs just crossed the threshold where multi-step debugging agents are actually useful, and confidential compute hardware is newly mature enough to make this deployment model practical. If those things converge, Corelayer could become the category-defining tool for data-specific incident response in regulated industries, and that's a large, lucrative niche. The Goldman Sachs network gives them a plausible path to those first crucial customers.

But I have no evidence any of that is happening yet. No customers named, no revenue disclosed, no waitlist mentioned, no organic sharing visible. The 20+ integrations suggest they've been building product, which is encouraging. Shipra's CMU CS background and Oracle infrastructure experience suggest genuine technical capability. Yet neither founder has visible open-source work or a public technical footprint that lets me assess whether they're hackers in the specific way I mean -- people who stay up all night because they can't stop building. The GitHub profiles are thin. That's not disqualifying for enterprise software in regulated industries, where you wouldn't expect open-source repos, but it means I'm evaluating technical founder quality on credentials rather than demonstrated craft.

This is a team that found a real problem through genuine experience and is willing to do the hard, ugly work of selling to regulated enterprises. That puts them ahead of most YC companies I see in AI-heavy categories. But the distance between "identified a real schlep" and "built something people are pulling toward them" is the distance between a plausible company and a fundable one. I'd want to see even one named customer, one LOI, one piece of evidence that Fortune 100 procurement is actually moving before writing a check from my own money.
