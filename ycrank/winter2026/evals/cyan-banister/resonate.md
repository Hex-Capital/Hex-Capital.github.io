# Resonate -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what strikes me first about Resonate: this is one of the most consensus ideas I've seen in a while. "Add AI to voice messages" — in 2026, after WhatsApp already shipped voice transcription, after Apple Intelligence is rolling out on-device processing, after Naval backed Airchat in this exact neighborhood. When I look for companies to invest in, I'm drawn to the ones that make other investors squirm, the ones that sound wrong or even a little absurd when you first hear them. Crusoe Energy mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota — that made people deeply uncomfortable. SpaceX building private rockets when everyone said Elon was burning cash for nothing. Resonate doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. It makes people nod politely. And in my experience, the ideas that make people nod politely are the ones where the upside has already been priced in by the market's attention.

I always want to hear the founder's story before anything else — not the pitch, the actual biographical thread that connects this person to this particular problem. Why voice messaging? Why is Sam Kaplan the person who needs to solve this? What I see is a talented engineer — Harvard CS, scaled Brex from 80 to a thousand people, shipped AI side projects in 2023 — but nothing in the dossier tells me why voice messaging is the problem that keeps him up at night. The product was possibly called "ChitChat" before becoming Resonate, which suggests the identity is still forming rather than emerging from a deep well of personal conviction. Lily Zhao's story about being thirty days from going broke when YC offered is the kind of raw financial pressure I understand viscerally from my own life, but it speaks to general startup survival, not to a biographical obsession with how humans communicate by voice. When I backed the Contraline founder, his years of dedicated research in male contraception told me everything — this was a person who had been living inside his problem long before anyone would fund him. I don't get that signal here.

The technology stack concerns me from a defensibility standpoint, which is one of the first things I probe for at the early stages. The core features — transcription via Whisper, emotion detection, filler word removal, text-to-video — are built on commodity APIs that any competent team can access. The YC page mentions Resonate Chat and Resonate Create and "many more products in the works," which at pre-seed with what appears to be a two-person team is a focus problem, not an ambition signal. The best early-stage founders I've backed were almost pathologically focused on one thing — Travis at Uber wasn't simultaneously building a food delivery app and a logistics dashboard. He was maniacally focused on getting a car to show up when you pressed a button. Multi-product sprawl at this stage tells me the team hasn't found the thing that burns.

Let me give the bull case its due, because I try to be honest about what I might be missing. Voice messaging genuinely is growing — 49% increase since 2020, over 60% of messaging users sending voice messages. If Resonate nails the UX integration so well that AI-processed voice becomes the default expectation — the way spell-check became invisible infrastructure — there's a version of this that creates a new communication category. The shareable transcript feature could generate viral loops that build network effects before incumbents replicate the full stack. Sam has legitimate engineering depth from scaling Brex, and the co-founders knew each other from high school, which gives them the kind of relationship foundation I've come to value after watching HQ Trivia collapse from founder conflict. If this were a founder who had experienced communication barriers firsthand — a speech impediment, a language gap, an accessibility need — and was building Resonate from that place of personal necessity, I'd lean in much harder. But even in the bull case, I struggle with the incumbency problem: WhatsApp has two billion users and is already adding these features incrementally.

What I uniquely look for in every investment is whether a company makes invisible systems visible or creates genuine economic access for people who lack it. Uber created income for drivers. Affirm made credit terms transparent. Carta turned opaque cap tables into structured equity data. Flock Safety brought crime data to neighborhoods that had been flying blind. Resonate adds polish to voice messages — it removes your "ums," detects your emotions, turns your audio into a video. That's a consumer convenience play, and there's nothing wrong with convenience, but it doesn't create economic opportunity for anyone who currently lacks it. It doesn't make an opaque system transparent. It makes a functional system slightly nicer. That's a feature set, not a mission that survives the inevitable dark moments every startup faces.
