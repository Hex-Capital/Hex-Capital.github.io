# Booko -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Booko is that I can't find the story. When I sit down with founders, I always start the same way -- tell me how you got here. Not the pitch, not the market sizing, the real path. With Booko, what I see are two Dartmouth graduates who studied economics and engineering, participated in the same investment club, and one of whom worked on dynamic pricing at Joby Aviation. That's a professional connection to the problem, and it's relevant, but it's not what I listen for. I listen for the salon owner who watched her mother lose the family business because Tuesday afternoons sat empty for years. I listen for the kid who grew up in a household where wasted hours meant wasted income. The biographical thread that makes this founder inseparable from this problem -- I can't find it here. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but the public record gives me nothing to work with, and that silence is loud in my framework.

The idea itself is sound but thoroughly unsurprising. Yield management for perishable inventory is one of the most well-studied problems in economics -- airlines cracked it in the 1980s, hotels followed, and now every Uber ride you take uses surge pricing. Applying this to fitness studios and med spas is the logical next vertical, and anyone who's taken an introductory microeconomics course could sketch it on a napkin. That's my problem. The most promising companies I've backed looked ridiculous when I first encountered them. Mining Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota? Private rockets? A ride-sharing app when the service was illegal in most cities? Those ideas made people uncomfortable. Dynamic pricing for hair salons makes people nod. When everyone nods, the opportunity has usually already been priced in, or the incumbents are already circling. And in this case, Mindbody and ClassPass are literally already doing dynamic pricing through their marketplace -- they're just doing it with a 20% commission structure that creates a structural conflict with building it on the B2B side. That conflict is the most interesting thing about Booko's positioning, and it's a real wedge. But a wedge created by someone else's business model conflict isn't the same as a founder-driven insight that nobody else sees.

I'll give the bull case its due, because I've learned not to dismiss things too quickly. If Arjun Saluja's dynamic pricing work at Joby was genuinely deep -- building real ML models for real-time pricing at scale -- that's a technical foundation most teams in this space don't have. The 15-25% revenue uplift claim, if it holds across verticals, is the kind of result that sells itself to small business owners who live and die by utilization rates. And the structural conflict at Mindbody is real: they make their money sending ClassPass users to studios at a 20% commission, so building a tool that helps studios fill those same slots independently would cannibalize their own marketplace revenue. That's a genuine opening. If Booko moves fast across integrations and builds a data advantage across thousands of service businesses before Vagaro or Mindbody responds, there's a real SaaS business here. But "real SaaS business" and "the kind of company I write checks for" are different things.

What I uniquely notice is what's missing from the impact story. When I invested in Uber, I saw it as a poverty-alleviation tool -- drivers who couldn't get medallions suddenly had income. Affirm gave people transparent credit when the alternative was predatory fees. Postmates created delivery work for people who needed flexible income. Booko optimizes revenue for businesses that already exist. The consumer angle -- cheaper off-peak appointments -- is there, but it's a secondary effect, not the mission. Nobody at Booko is waking up at 3 AM because underserved communities can't access affordable haircuts. This is an optimization play for business owners, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't create the kind of economic access I gravitate toward.

The platform dependency also concerns me, and not in an abstract way. I spent years in security at IronPort, and one thing you learn in infrastructure is that whoever controls the API controls the relationship. Booko's entire value proposition depends on maintaining API access to Mindbody, Vagaro, Acuity, and whoever else dominates scheduling. Any of those platforms can change their terms, restrict access, or ship a "dynamic pricing" tab in their own product. Vagaro just acquired Schedulicity in January 2025 -- they're consolidating. When the platform you depend on starts acquiring companies, you're either on the acquisition list or the kill list. There's no regulatory moat here, no data advantage that takes years to build, no network effect that makes the product fundamentally harder to replicate. The defensibility story is entirely about execution speed, and execution speed is not a moat.

I don't have enough signal on the co-founder relationship to raise a flag or give reassurance. They share a Dartmouth background and overlapping extracurriculars, which is fine but tells me nothing about how they fight, how they divide authority, or what happens when the first real crisis hits. After HQ Trivia, I always want to know: who decides when you disagree? I can't assess that here. This is a pass for me -- not because the founders aren't capable or the problem isn't real, but because nothing about this company activates the pattern recognition that has served me well. It's consensus, it's incremental, and the founders' connection to the problem appears professional rather than personal. I wish them well, but this isn't my bet to make.
