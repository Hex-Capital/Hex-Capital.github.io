# Maywood -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what I notice first: every signal in this deal points in the same direction, and it's the direction of consensus. Datasite spent over $200 million acquiring Grata in June 2025 and scooped up Blueflame AI the very next month. OffDeal raised $17 million. F2 AI raised $10 million. CapVest committed half a billion dollars to expand Datasite's AI capabilities. When I see a space where incumbents are actively consolidating and multiple well-funded startups are already building, the weirdness has been arbitraged out. The most promising companies are not popular -- and "AI for M&A" is very popular right now. I'm not saying the market isn't real. I'm saying this is not the kind of bet I make. I'm looking for the company that sounds ridiculous, that gets dismissed by everyone in the room, that makes people uncomfortable. Maywood makes people nod along.

If I could sit down with Drake Goodman, my first question would be the same one it always is: tell me your story, not the business. And what I'd hear, based on what I can see, is Wharton Huntsman Summa Cum Laude, Blackstone private equity, saw inefficiencies in deal execution, decided to build a better tool. Kent would tell me MIT, BCG, automated processes for Fortune 500 companies. Esteban would tell me MIT, published at ICML, applied ML at Balyasny. These are exceptional credentials -- I'm not dismissing their intelligence or capability. But I'm listening for something else entirely. I'm listening for the biographical thread that makes this problem feel like it belongs to them at a level deeper than professional observation. Drake saw the problem at Blackstone -- that's pattern recognition from inside the machine. It's not the kind of obsession that survives when the company hits a wall and the easy path is to go back to a seven-figure finance career. When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research that everyone else ignored, because the problem was personally his in a way that couldn't be explained by his resume. I don't get that signal here.

Now, there is one thing that genuinely catches my attention: Drake and Kent Goodman share a surname, which means they're almost certainly siblings. After what happened with HQ Trivia -- where the right product at the right time was destroyed by co-founder conflict in a 50/50 split -- I pay close attention to how founders handle disagreement. Family businesses have built-in conflict resolution patterns. Siblings who choose to build together have a relationship that predates the company and will outlast it. That's a real signal for me, and paired with Esteban's MIT connection to Kent, this team has the kind of relational foundation I look for. I'd want to understand the dynamics more deeply in conversation, but the structure is promising.

The bull case is real and I want to be honest about it. The team has genuine founder-market fit: Drake did the work, Kent automated similar workflows, Esteban has the ML depth to build it. They've already achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance at pre-seed, which tells me they understand that selling to banks means playing by the bank's rules -- that's a barrier that eliminates most startups before they get their first meeting. The customer testimonials about doubling deal capacity with the same headcount are the exact language that gets middle-market managing directors to sign purchase orders. And they're selling tools to banks rather than competing with them, which is a smarter wedge than OffDeal's approach of becoming an AI-native bank. If Maywood can lock in firm-specific data integrations -- formatting conventions, historical deal patterns, internal language -- the switching costs compound over time. In a world where Datasite is buying rather than building, Maywood could be an acquisition target at a meaningful multiple within a few years, and the Grata acquisition at $200 million provides a concrete comp. The regulatory complexity of this space is exactly the kind of moat I respect.

But here's where I keep landing: this company makes investment bankers more productive. It does not create economic access for people who lack it. It does not make an invisible system visible to those who've been excluded from it. When I invested in Uber, I saw a poverty-alleviation tool for drivers. When I backed Affirm, I saw transparent credit replacing hidden fees that trapped working families. When I invested in Carta, equity ownership became legible to startup employees who previously couldn't understand what their shares were worth. Maywood makes deal execution faster for professionals who already earn significant compensation. That's a real business -- maybe a very good one -- but it's not the kind of bet that pulls me in. I invest where capitalism creates positive-sum outcomes for people at the margins, and the margins of investment banking are still a very comfortable place to be.

I'm passing, not because Maywood won't succeed -- they very well might, and the acquisition dynamics in this space could reward them handsomely -- but because this company doesn't activate any of the signals I've learned to trust. It's not weird. It's not dismissed. It's not solving a problem rooted in biographical hardship. And it's not creating access where access didn't exist before. This is a well-credentialed team building a sensible product in a validated market, and there are many investors for whom that's exactly the right profile. I'm just not one of them.
