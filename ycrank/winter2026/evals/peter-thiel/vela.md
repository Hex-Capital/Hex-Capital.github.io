# Vela -- Peter Thiel Evaluation

The first question I ask is always the same: what is the secret? What important truth about the world does this company see that most intelligent people actively reject? With Vela, I cannot locate one. The proposition -- that scheduling coordination can be handled by a conversational AI agent rather than booking links or human assistants -- is not a secret. It is a consensus prediction. Every major technology company is building AI agents for every conceivable workflow. Google owns Gmail and Google Calendar and has Gemini. Microsoft owns Outlook and has Copilot. Calendly, with $352 million raised and a $3 billion valuation, will inevitably add conversational capabilities to its existing platform with its massive installed base. When every smart person in Silicon Valley agrees that "AI agents will handle scheduling," you do not have a secret -- you have a crowded market forming in real time. And crowded markets are where value goes to die.

The competitive structure here is what concerns me most. This is not a zero-to-one company entering a new category -- it is a one-to-n company entering a well-funded, multi-player market and claiming to do it slightly differently. "Conversational negotiation instead of booking links" is a feature distinction, not a category distinction. Calendly's core architecture could incorporate an LLM negotiation layer with a fraction of the engineering effort required to build Vela's distribution from scratch. Google and Microsoft do not merely compete in this space -- they own the calendar and email infrastructure that Vela depends on for its integrations. When your differentiation relies on APIs controlled by entities that could replicate your product as a feature toggle, you have built your house on someone else's foundation. The multi-channel integration across email, SMS, WhatsApp, and phone sounds impressive until you realize it creates dependency without defensibility -- each channel is a platform risk vector, not a moat.

The technology itself does not clear the threshold I look for. An LLM-based scheduling agent is an application layer, not proprietary technology. There is no novel algorithm, no breakthrough in natural language understanding, no computational advantage that compounds over time. The core capability -- parsing "early next week" and negotiating availability across participants -- is available to any team with access to frontier models and calendar APIs. When I backed Palantir, the insight was that PayPal's fraud detection algorithms could be adapted for intelligence analysis -- that was a non-obvious technical transfer that required deep engineering to execute. Vela's technical approach is the obvious application of existing capabilities to an obvious problem. The dossier notes no patents, no proprietary technical claims, no open-source contributions. Scheduling preference data, cited as a potential moat, is thin -- scheduling preferences are relatively simple and easily expressed, unlike the dense, classified intelligence graphs that make Palantir's integrations irreplaceable.

I should address the bull case honestly. The strongest argument for Vela is vertical specialization -- if they deeply embed in enterprise recruiting workflows, accumulating institutional knowledge about how specific companies run multi-party interview loops, they could build switching costs analogous to how enterprise software becomes sticky through workflow integration. The recruiting vertical genuinely has painful, high-volume scheduling coordination that breaks existing tools. Two adjacent competitors were recently acquired (Reclaim.ai by Dropbox, Kronologic by East 11 Ventures), creating a potential gap. And the founding team is not without merit -- Saatvik's technical credentials (CMU CS with highest honors completed in two years, AWS ML Supercompute, Perplexity) are genuine, and his decision to leave a Booth MBA/MS CS dual degree to build this shows willingness to sacrifice an easier path. But this bull case requires believing that Vela can achieve the kind of deep enterprise embedding that Palantir achieved in intelligence -- and Palantir's embedding worked precisely because the intelligence community operates behind security clearances and decade-long procurement cycles that exclude casual competitors. Enterprise recruiting has no such structural barriers. A recruiter can switch scheduling tools in an afternoon.

The founding team presents a tension. Gobhanu's background at BCG AI places him in a category I have historically been skeptical of -- consultants who identify market opportunities through analysis rather than engineers who build from technical conviction. The microfinance organization they co-founded as teenagers across 77 countries demonstrates operational ambition, and I respect the scale of that execution. But operational capability in nonprofit microfinance does not translate directly into the kind of deep technical vision I look for in a company that must build proprietary technology to survive. I see accomplished credentials and genuine ambition, but I do not see the founder archetype that characterizes my strongest investments -- the technically obsessive builder with a specific vision of how the world must change and the stubbornness to hold that vision against every pressure to compromise. The positioning across "multiple verticals (recruiting, sales, legal, executives)" from the outset suggests breadth-first thinking rather than the deliberate narrowness that creates monopoly. Facebook started at Harvard, not "at universities, companies, and organizations."

This is a competent team building a reasonable product in a market where competence and reasonableness are insufficient. The scheduling coordination space will produce a winner, but that winner will almost certainly be the company that already owns the infrastructure -- Google, Microsoft, or Calendly with its existing distribution -- not a pre-seed startup whose entire technical advantage can be replicated by any team with an API key. I pass.
