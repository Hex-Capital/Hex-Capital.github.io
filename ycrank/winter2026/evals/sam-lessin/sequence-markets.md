# Sequence Markets -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's my core problem with Sequence Markets: the idea is completely sane. Everyone agrees that institutional crypto execution is fragmented and that smart order routing would help. Talos has raised $150 million and is valued at $1.5 billion building exactly this. FalconX raised $430 million at an $8 billion valuation. CoinRoutes literally patented smart order routing for digital assets. When I look at this company, I see a sane idea pursued by early-career founders -- the precise inversion of the combination I need. Brian Armstrong at Coinbase was a sane person proposing something most of Silicon Valley thought was insane. Two recent graduates proposing to build a better version of what several well-capitalized companies already sell to institutions is... a sane person with a sane idea. And sane ideas at pre-seed produce consensus returns, which means they produce bad returns.

The "AI-powered routing" positioning triggers every alarm I have. Strip away the AI label and ask: would this business have a defensible competitive position if AI didn't exist? The answer is no -- it would be yet another smart order router competing against patented incumbents with deeper exchange integrations and larger engineering teams. The AI IS the claimed differentiation, which means this is a feature, not a company. Every single one of those incumbents will have equivalent or superior AI routing within twelve months. Talos just acquired Coin Metrics for its data infrastructure. FalconX is acquiring 21Shares. These players are expanding into every adjacent capability, and "add AI to our existing routing" is a Tuesday afternoon engineering sprint for them, not a strategic initiative. This is the quintessential software company where the moat gets weaker as AI gets cheaper -- the opposite of what I want to fund.

Let me steelman the bull case, because the tokenization angle deserves consideration. If you believe that real-world asset tokenization genuinely creates $16 trillion in new tradable instruments by 2030, and that these instruments will trade across a fragmented landscape of venues that don't exist yet, then maybe the execution infrastructure needs to be rebuilt from scratch rather than bolted onto existing crypto routing. A venue-neutral, non-custodial execution layer purpose-built for tokenized everything -- equities, real estate, credit -- is a different narrative than "better crypto order routing." That narrative has some genuine expansiveness. And Peter Bai's TMX Group experience, while junior, does connect to traditional market structure in a way that crypto-native competitors don't emphasize. If the tokenization thesis plays out and Sequence can position as the neutral execution primitive for this new asset class, the story could get interesting. But that's a lot of conditional logic stacked on top of a team that's competing against organizations with fifty to a hundred times their resources and years of head start.

The protocol-versus-application distinction is decisive here. Look at my best crypto investments -- Algorand, Aleo, Helium, Lightning Labs. They all share a common architecture: they're building new layers that other applications integrate with and build on top of. They create compounding network effects because every new participant makes the protocol more valuable. Sequence Markets is the opposite -- it's middleware sitting between existing exchanges and existing clients, routing orders through existing infrastructure. Nothing about it becomes a standard. Nothing about it generates the kind of lock-in where other companies' products get better because Sequence exists. It's a vendor, not a primitive. The $15 billion in aggregated liquidity isn't Sequence's liquidity -- it's everyone else's liquidity that Sequence is accessing through API integrations any sufficiently motivated engineering team could replicate.

The founder profile compounds my concern rather than alleviating it. Building sub-millisecond latency execution infrastructure for institutions demanding best execution is one of the hardest engineering challenges in fintech. Peter Bai's pension fund and TMX experience gives him real domain exposure to market microstructure, and that's genuinely relevant -- but at an early-career level, not at the level of someone who's architected trading systems handling billions in daily volume. Muhammad Awan is an incoming Databricks intern with quantitative finance interest. These are promising young people, but the gap between their current capabilities and the infrastructure they're proposing to build against Talos's hundreds of engineers is the kind of mismatch that makes me want to see them spend five more years accumulating operational depth before writing a check. The team has no visible technical artifacts -- no GitHub repos, no published research, no open-source contributions -- which makes the sub-millisecond latency and AI routing claims impossible to evaluate. At the end of the day, I need the "sane" credential to be overwhelming enough to justify the bet on an idea this competitive, and I don't see it here.
