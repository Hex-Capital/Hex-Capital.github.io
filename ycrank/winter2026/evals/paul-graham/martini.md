# Martini -- Paul Graham Evaluation

The first thing I notice about Martini is that the origin of the idea is genuinely organic. Koh Terai is a Cannes-screened cinematographer with a CS degree who went on to get a design master's at Stanford. When someone with that background tells me the current AI video tools feel like "prompting a chatbot" instead of "directing a film," I believe them, because that frustration could only come from someone who has actually directed a film and then tried to use Sora. This isn't a team that read about generative AI video in TechCrunch and brainstormed what to build. Terai would have encountered this problem personally, felt the specific wrongness of text-prompt interfaces that have no concept of a lens or a camera movement, and decided to fix it. That organic founder-problem connection is the strongest signal in this dossier.

But organic discovery alone isn't enough. The second question is whether there's a real schlep here -- something painful enough that smart people unconsciously avoid it. The answer is mixed. Building cinematography-native UX requires genuine domain expertise that most engineering teams lack, and integrating multiple AI model APIs with different capabilities, pricing structures, and output formats is tedious plumbing work. The NLE export pipeline to Premiere and Resolve adds another layer. It's real complexity. But it's not the kind of schlep that makes your unconscious filter the idea out entirely. When Stripe tackled payments, the schlep was dealing with banks, fraud regulations, PCI compliance, and chargebacks -- an institutional morass that made programmers physically recoil. Martini's schlep is more "deep domain knowledge required" than "regulatory labyrinth that nobody wants to enter." That distinction matters because domain expertise barriers slow competitors down but don't stop them permanently.

The structural question that concerns me most is where Martini sits in the value chain. It's an orchestration layer between commodity inputs (third-party AI models) and commodity outputs (video files). The dossier correctly identifies the business model conflict that protects Martini from Runway and Luma -- those companies can't build a model-agnostic layer without cannibalizing their own model revenue. That's a real structural insight and it's the kind of moat mechanism I find compelling. But it protects against the wrong enemy. The existential threat isn't Runway. It's Adobe. Adobe owns Premiere Pro -- the primary export target -- invested in Runway's Series E, and has the design-tool DNA to build exactly this kind of collaborative creative workspace. When your product's main selling point includes "exports to Premiere Pro," and Adobe owns Premiere Pro, you are building a feature that the platform owner can absorb. Figma succeeded against Adobe partly because web-based collaboration was genuinely a different paradigm that Adobe's desktop architecture couldn't easily replicate. I'm less certain that "cinematography controls for AI video" represents a similarly unbridgeable gap.

The co-founder dynamic gives me pause. No shared prior employer or university between Terai and Hoang. I've seen this pattern enough times to have a strong prior about it. In one YC batch, nine companies added co-founders they didn't know well, and all nine fell apart within a year. The relationship must predate the startup. Now, both founders are in the @c47-inc GitHub organization, so they clearly chose each other deliberately, and the skill complementarity is excellent -- a cinematographer who codes paired with a systems engineer who contributes to Supabase. But the absence of any visible pre-existing relationship is a risk factor I can't ignore.

The bull case is worth taking seriously. If AI video generation continues improving at its current pace, professional filmmakers will increasingly need production-grade tools rather than toy interfaces. The "Figma for generative film" analogy has real teeth -- Figma won because design was inherently collaborative but design tools weren't. Film production is also inherently collaborative, and current AI video tools are single-user prompt boxes. If Martini becomes the workspace where creative teams pre-visualize, iterate, and assemble rough cuts across multiple AI models, the switching costs from project data, team configurations, and established workflows could be substantial. The 200+ films created on the platform, with some airing as TV commercials, is a real traction signal at pre-seed. And Terai's combination of professional filmmaking credentials and technical capability is genuinely rare -- this is someone who understands both the creative need and how to build the solution, which is approximately as rare as finding programmers who understood the banking system well enough to build Stripe. If the market develops the way the bull case suggests, Martini's founder-market fit is among the strongest you could find for this specific problem.

But "if the market develops" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. The professional AI filmmaking market might not emerge as a distinct, large category. It might stay a feature of existing tools rather than becoming a platform. And even if it does emerge, the thin margin structure of a pass-through orchestration layer -- where you're paying Veo 3 for generation and marking it up with workflow value -- makes the path to default alive precarious. I don't see evidence of the financial discipline or growth awareness that would tell me these founders have internalized the economics of their own business model.

The technical founding team is solid. Terai has a CS degree and active GitHub presence. Hoang has 70 public repos, contributions to Supabase, and robotics championship wins. They've built a working product with multi-model integration, professional camera controls, a timeline editor, and NLE export. These are builders, not PowerPoint founders. That counts for a lot at pre-seed.

This is a company with one genuinely strong signal -- the organic founder-problem fit of a professional cinematographer building professional filmmaking tools -- surrounded by real structural concerns about defensibility, co-founder relationship depth, and market formation. The idea wasn't manufactured. The founders can build. But the schlep isn't deep enough to create a lasting moat, and the orchestration-layer positioning makes me nervous about long-term value capture. I'd want to see evidence that the co-founders' relationship is deeper than what public data reveals, and I'd want to hear their specific plan for what happens when Adobe builds AI generation directly into Premiere Pro.
