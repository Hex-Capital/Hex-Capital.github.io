# Aemon -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

The most striking thing about Aemon is how fast its core technique is commoditizing — not in theory, not eventually, but right now, in public, with open-source repos you can clone today. OpenEvolve, ThetaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve have all replicated the evolutionary LLM search paradigm and in some cases surpassed Aemon's own benchmark claims. The circle packing leaderboard that Aemon leads with as its credibility signal is a competitive sprint where multiple independent teams — including an individual student with a framework called "Tactical Maniac v0.5" — are posting results in the same ballpark. When your flagship proof point is a benchmark that strangers on the internet are matching with open-source tooling, you don't have a moat. You have a demo. I learned this lesson painfully with Birchbox — narrative magnitude without structural defensibility produces the worst venture outcome. Here the structural erosion isn't hypothetical. It's already happening in real time on GitHub.

The founders are the one genuinely compelling signal. Twin brothers, both published at ICLR and EMNLP before turning twenty, international medals in math and robotics, Afore Capital FIR program. Ray and Richard Zhou are clearly precocious, technically gifted, and operating with real research credibility. The "sane" half of my filter is solidly met — these are legitimate researchers who can ship results. But the "insane idea" half collapses entirely. AI-powered R&D optimization is the hottest consensus category in venture right now. Sakana AI raised $479 million. Periodic Labs raised a $300 million seed. Google DeepMind built AlphaEvolve and is running it internally on production systems. When I described Brian Armstrong as a "sane person with an insane idea," the insane part was that nobody believed in cryptocurrency exchanges in 2012. Nobody is disbelieving in AI for scientific discovery in 2026 — every major lab and hundreds of startups are racing into this space. Sane people pursuing consensus ideas is the exact configuration my framework screens out, because the returns are already priced into the market.

My "cherry on top" test demolishes this one. Would Aemon be a good business if AI didn't exist? Obviously not — there is no business without AI. AI isn't enhancing an existing operation the way it enhances Craftwork's painting dispatch or Metropolis's parking infrastructure. AI IS the entirety of the value proposition. This is a tech company with no paint layer, and that's exactly the category where I expect incumbent distribution to win. Google DeepMind already has the frontier models, the compute budget, the enterprise relationships, and a working internal product. The only structural argument for Aemon is that Google won't commercialize AlphaEvolve — but "betting that Google won't enter your market" is not a moat, it's a prayer. And even if Google stays internal, the open-source implementations mean any sophisticated engineering team can stand up their own evolutionary search pipeline without buying from Aemon.

The strongest bull case is this: maybe Aemon is the AWS of algorithmic R&D. Amazon didn't invent servers or virtualization — it productized infrastructure that everyone knew how to build but nobody had packaged for external consumption. If Aemon can build the reliable, enterprise-grade platform with domain-specific workflows, integrations, and support that neither Google nor open-source projects will provide, there could be a large services business here. The <$10 compute claim for beating AlphaEvolve, if real, suggests genuine algorithmic taste that could compound into a product advantage. And the TAM narrative is expansive — every engineering team faces optimization problems, and if you're the platform they turn to, that's a theoretically infinite surface area. For this bull case to work, though, you need the product layer itself to be defensible — reliability, workflow integration, accumulated domain knowledge across customer engagements. But that's a SaaS moat, and my whole thesis is that SaaS moats dissolve as software gets cheaper. The very AI capabilities that make Aemon possible also make it replicable.

This is an application built on someone else's protocols. Aemon uses LLMs built by others, evolutionary algorithms documented in published research, and benchmark problems defined by the academic community. It is not creating a new primitive that other companies build on — it's assembling existing primitives into a product. Compare this to Aleo, which created zero-knowledge privacy infrastructure that becomes a layer other applications depend on, or Venmo, which established a new peer-to-peer payment primitive. Aemon has no protocol-layer position, no network effects, and no compounding lock-in. Each customer engagement is independent. That caps the theoretical upside and makes the "infinity story" incoherent — the narrative expands in theory but the business doesn't compound in practice.

I'm passing. The founders have genuine research talent and I wouldn't be surprised if they build something impressive eventually, but this specific company in this specific market structure fails every distinctive test in my framework. The idea is consensus, the moat is software-only and already commoditizing, the position is application-layer, and there's no revenue cushion. If Ray and Richard pivot to something where their algorithmic instincts serve as a "cherry on top" for a business with physical-world operations or protocol-layer positioning, I'd want to see it. But funding an AI-first company in the hottest AI category, competing against Google's internal tooling and half a dozen open-source alternatives, with a SaaS business model? That's buying narrative at market price with no structural edge. I'd rather fund a painting company.
