# Crosslayer Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

Here's what stops me first: Long Journey is already on the cap table. So I need to be honest about what I see here and whether my own firm's involvement reflects conviction I actually feel, or whether this was a bet one of my partners led that I'd evaluate differently on my own. Let me work through this as if I'm looking at Crosslayer Labs fresh, with my own checkbook.

The technical moat is genuinely extraordinary. Henry Birge-Lee coded the first implementation of MPIC in 2016, led the research that proved BGP attacks could compromise HTTPS certificates, and then co-authored the CA/Browser Forum ballot that made his solution mandatory for every certificate authority on earth. That ballot passed unanimously. Eight million certificates a day now use what this team invented. I spent years at IronPort living inside protocol-level security -- I understand how rare it is for the people who actually wrote a global internet standard to then start a company commercializing the expertise behind it. That's not a moat you can reproduce by hiring a few engineers. That's a decade of published research at USENIX Security and ACM CCS, relationships with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Let's Encrypt built through the standardization process, and the kind of deep protocol knowledge that takes years to accumulate. Cisco paid $830 million for IronPort because that kind of infrastructure security expertise is genuinely scarce. The parallel resonates with me.

But when I ask my first question -- "Tell me your story, not the business" -- I hit a wall. Henry is a Princeton BA, Princeton PhD student. Grace is a Princeton PhD student in the same department. Prateek Mittal is a tenured Princeton professor with an ACM Grace Hopper Award, faculty research awards from basically every tech giant, and enough institutional prestige to fill a wall. This is about as establishment-academic as a founding team gets. I'm not hearing about someone who slept in their car while building prototypes, or a founder who was told "no" fifty times and kept going. The CA/Browser Forum voted unanimously for their standard. Their research won the IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize. These are founders who have been consistently validated by every institution they've touched. That's impressive -- but it's not the signal I've learned to trust most. The founders who keep me up at night with excitement are the ones who had to claw their way to being heard, whose conviction was forged by personal experience with the problem, not by academic curiosity about it. I don't know what drove Henry Birge-Lee to care about BGP attacks specifically -- maybe there's a personal story I'm not seeing in the dossier -- but what I can see is a research agenda that became a company, not a lived problem that demanded a solution.

The "weird factor" is also muted for me. Cross-layer internet security monitoring is technically sophisticated, but it's not the kind of idea that makes other investors recoil. Nobody thinks protecting websites from impersonation attacks is crazy. Compare that to Crusoe Energy -- when Chase and Cully told people they wanted to mine Bitcoin on gas flares in North Dakota, everyone thought they'd lost their minds. That discomfort is exactly the signal I look for, because it means the price hasn't been bid up and the consensus hasn't formed yet. Crosslayer Labs sits in the attack surface management market alongside Censys ($131M raised), CyCognito ($153M, $800M valuation), and CrowdStrike's Falcon Surface. The competitive landscape is well-funded and well-understood. Yes, the cross-layer correlation approach is differentiated, but it's differentiated in a way that a thoughtful security analyst would nod at, not in a way that makes people question your sanity. The bull case would require me to believe that this narrow but deep technical advantage can survive incumbent expansion -- that CrowdStrike and Palo Alto won't simply add BGP/DNS/TLS correlation as a feature within their existing platforms. The MPIC expertise creates a time advantage, not a permanent moat against well-resourced competitors.

Where I genuinely lean in is on the regulatory navigation dimension. The CA/Browser Forum is an opaque, consensus-driven standards body where getting a ballot approved requires years of relationship-building, technical credibility, and political skill. This team didn't just navigate that process -- they drove it. Ballot SC-067 created the regulatory moment that makes their commercial product timely: enterprises and CAs are now aware that BGP-based impersonation is a real threat, and the enforcement date of September 2025 creates urgency. This mirrors what I've seen work with Anduril in defense procurement and Affirm in financial regulation -- founders who understand the regulatory landscape deeply enough to use it as a competitive advantage rather than an obstacle. If I squint, I can see the "making invisible systems visible" pattern that runs through my portfolio: Flock Safety made neighborhood crime data visible, Carta made cap tables visible, and Crosslayer Labs makes invisible infrastructure-layer attacks visible to enterprises that currently have no way to detect them. That thread is real.

The strongest bull case: if the academic-to-commercial transition succeeds, this team could build the definitive internet infrastructure security platform. The MPIC standard creates a wedge into every certificate authority and every enterprise that relies on HTTPS -- which is everyone. The cross-layer correlation engine could expand beyond the initial four attack vectors into a comprehensive internet infrastructure monitoring platform. The IronPort comparison is apt -- a small team with deep protocol expertise building enterprise security infrastructure that eventually becomes critical to the internet's functioning. If Henry Birge-Lee turns out to have the commercial instincts to match his technical brilliance, and if Prateek Mittal is genuinely committed beyond an advisory role, this could be the kind of infrastructure play where I override my preference for scrappy outsider founders -- the way I did with SpaceX. But SpaceX had Elon Musk's intensity and track record of execution in a commercial context. I don't yet see that commercial execution signal here.

I respect this team's technical accomplishment deeply, and my IronPort background gives me genuine appreciation for what they've built. But my investment framework isn't optimized for credentialed academic teams commercializing respected research. It's optimized for misfits solving problems that grew out of their own hardship. Crosslayer Labs is a strong company that doesn't activate the signals I've learned to trust most.
