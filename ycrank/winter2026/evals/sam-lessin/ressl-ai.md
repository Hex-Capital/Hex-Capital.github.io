# Ressl AI -- Sam Lessin Evaluation

Here's a company that walked away from $440K in revenue on a Salesforce AI product to build autonomous agents for collision shops and HVAC contractors. That pivot tells me one of two things: either the founders saw something structurally bigger in trades than in Salesforce administration, or they hit a ceiling on the first product and are chasing a hotter narrative. The problem is, the narrative they're chasing -- "AI agents that replace back-office workers" -- is the single most consensus category in venture right now. Netic has already raised $43M from Founders Fund and Greylock at a $450M valuation with 1,700% revenue growth in this exact space. ServiceTitan, a public company with deep existing customer relationships, is already shipping AI Voice Agents and SMS Booking Agents into its installed base. When I ask my core question -- is this a sane person with an insane idea? -- I get the inverse. The founders seem technically capable (Microsoft internship, Google Scholarship, IIT Bombay), but the idea is thoroughly sane. Everyone agrees AI agents will automate back-office work. That's not a non-consensus bet; that's a consensus bet with a capital disadvantage.

The structural moat problem here is severe and it maps directly onto my core framework. Strip the AI layer away from Ressl and ask: what's left? There's no painting crew, no parking hardware, no wireless hotspot network. There's a software integration layer sitting on top of other people's platforms -- CCCOne, QuickBooks, scheduling tools -- that could be replicated by anyone with API access and a capable model. The dossier itself states plainly: "No strong defensibility signals found in public sources at this stage" and "The underlying technology stack (LLM agents interacting with APIs) is accessible to well-funded competitors." This is the archetype of what I warn about when I say software moats are dissolving. A vertical AI agent company's "domain knowledge" takes time to encode but isn't structurally defensible -- and the incumbents who own the customer relationships and data will encode it faster once they decide to. ServiceTitan's potential business model conflict (cannibalizing their own per-seat pricing) might buy Ressl a window, but that window closes the moment ServiceTitan decides margin expansion matters more than seat count.

The co-founder dynamic raises an additional flag I can't ignore. The evidence suggests Arushi Gandhi and Abhishek Eswaran may have connected through Entrepreneurs First -- a program literally designed to match strangers into co-founding teams. I've watched enough founding teams fracture under real pressure to know that co-founders who met through an accelerator matchmaking program carry meaningfully higher relationship risk than teams with deep shared history. This isn't disqualifying on its own, but combined with a recent pivot and zero public traction on the new product, it compounds the execution risk.

I want to be honest about the bull case because the PE roll-up distribution channel is genuinely clever. Private equity firms buying up trades businesses have explicit mandates to cut costs across portfolio companies, and a single PE relationship could unlock deployments across dozens of locations. If Ressl nails the integration for one collision repair chain, the PE sponsor has financial incentive to push it across every shop in their portfolio. That's high-leverage distribution. And the trades market is real -- these businesses genuinely do employ "glue workers" doing copy-paste labor between legacy systems. If Ressl could get deep enough into specific sub-verticals fast enough to build proprietary workflow data before Netic or ServiceTitan covers the same ground, the integration complexity that makes this hard could flip into a switching cost moat. But "could" is doing enormous lifting in that sentence. The founders lack specific trades industry experience, they're competing against a $43M-funded competitor with 1,700% growth, and they abandoned a revenue-generating product to chase this market with $500-750K in total funding. The math on outrunning Netic's capital and ServiceTitan's distribution doesn't work.

This company triggers nearly every pattern I screen against. AI is the core value proposition, not the cherry on top. The moat is software-based with no physical-world operations. The market is hot and attracting massive capital. The founders' differentiation claim centers on AI capabilities. The business model appears to be SaaS-style recurring revenue. Remove AI from the equation and there is no business at all -- the opposite of my test. I'd rather invest in the trades businesses themselves, with a tech layer making their operations more efficient, than invest in a tech company selling to trades businesses. That's the Craftwork thesis: own the operations, use software to amplify them. Ressl is all amplifier, no operations.
