# Librar Labs -- Cyan Banister Evaluation

The first thing that strikes me about Librar Labs is who isn't in the room. I want to hear about someone who grew up without books, who experienced the sting of illiteracy in their family, who saw a child fall behind because their school had no library and felt that failure so deeply they couldn't do anything else. Instead, what I see are very young Swedish founders -- Jonathan Görtz appears to be around 20 years old based on his education timeline -- who've come through the Stockholm School of Economics incubator with a string of short-lived prior projects (Cyberboost, Gymbro AI, each lasting under a year). One founder, Kaan Sirin, worked as a librarian and presumably saw the daily friction firsthand, and that's a genuine connection to the problem. But "I worked in this job and it was inefficient" is different from "this problem shaped who I am and I've been circling it for years." When I backed Contraline, the founder had spent years in academic research that others dismissed -- his whole identity was fused to the mission. I'm not getting that signal here.

Where this company does catch my attention is through the lens of economic access. The stat that 98% of the world's schools don't have a library management system, and that a fifth of American high school graduates are functionally illiterate -- that's the kind of invisible infrastructure gap I've spent my career trying to fund. A product that lets any school with a smartphone set up a functioning library without a trained librarian, without specialized equipment, without procurement committees approving six-figure contracts -- that's genuinely making an invisible system visible. It reminds me of what drew me to Thumbtack or Postmates: tools that let people participate in systems they were previously locked out of. If Librar actually reaches schools in Sub-Saharan Africa, rural India, or underserved American communities where there's no librarian and no budget, that's a meaningful expansion of access to knowledge. The traction signal of 300 schools and 60% penetration of Swedish single-site private schools in three months shows the product works and spreads quickly. That's real.

But here's my problem: this isn't the kind of bet that makes me uncomfortable, and the best investments always do. Library management software is a sensible, well-understood category. Nobody hears "we're building AI-powered library software" and thinks these founders are crazy. Compare that to when I first heard about mining Bitcoin on gas flares, or male contraceptive gel, or a ride-sharing app that was illegal in most cities. Those ideas provoked genuine discomfort and confusion in sophisticated investors. Librar Labs is a good product in a clear market with an obvious value proposition. That's precisely the kind of deal where consensus forms quickly, competition emerges, and pricing gets driven toward commodity. The computer vision spine-recognition piece is technically interesting, but it's not the kind of technology risk that creates a moat I can feel in my bones -- general-purpose vision APIs are improving rapidly, and a well-resourced competitor like Follett could invest in this capability if the market signal becomes strong enough.

The strongest bull case would require believing that these young founders have stumbled onto a wedge into something much larger -- that "the intelligence layer for the physical world" isn't just a tagline but a real product roadmap that extends book spine recognition into broader physical-world understanding. If Librar's computer vision dataset, built across hundreds of schools with diverse shelf configurations and lighting conditions, becomes a proprietary asset that enables them to expand into broader physical inventory management for schools (supplies, equipment, textbooks) and eventually beyond education entirely, then this small wedge could become a platform. And if these founders -- despite their youth and short-lived prior ventures -- are the ones who can navigate U.S. school district procurement and reach the underserved schools where this product matters most, the impact could be enormous. Carl-Hugo Jacobsson's track record building Ungdomsförmedlingen to 40,000 members shows he can scale a platform that serves young people. But I'd need to sit across from them and feel that conviction, hear how they handle the question of what happens when Follett decides to add a camera button to Destiny, and understand whether this team has the stomach for what is fundamentally a long, grinding enterprise sales motion into one of the most bureaucratic buying environments in America.

Ultimately, this is a team that has built something real and useful, with genuine potential for positive impact on literacy access globally. I respect the execution. But my portfolio is built on outsider founders solving problems forged in their own biographies, in spaces where other investors won't go. Library software, built by early-career founders from the SSE ecosystem, backed by YC -- that's closer to consensus territory than where I hunt. I'd want to see these founders go through some real fire and come out the other side before I'd write a check from my own money.
